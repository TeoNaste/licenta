Hi, how are you doing?
I'm fine.
How about yourself?
I'm pretty good.
Thanks for asking.
No problem.
So how have you been?
I've been great.
What about you?
I've been good.
I'm in school right now.
What school do you go to?
I go to PCC.
Do you like it there?
It's okay.
It's a really big campus.
Good luck with school.
Thank you very much.
How's it going?
I'm doing well.
How about you?
Never better, thanks.
So how have you been lately?
I've actually been pretty good.
You?
I'm actually in school right now.
Which school do you attend?
I'm attending PCC right now.
Are you enjoying it there?
It's not bad.
There are a lot of people there.
Good luck with that.
Thanks.
How are you doing today?
I'm doing great.
What about you?
I'm absolutely lovely, thank you.
Everything's been good with you?
I haven't been better.
How about yourself?
I started school recently.
Where are you going to school?
I'm going to PCC.
How do you like it so far?
I like it so far.
My classes are pretty good right now.
I wish you luck.
Thanks a lot.
It's an ugly day today.
I know. I think it may rain.
It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be.
I really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
Me too. I can't wait until winter.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot.
Me too.
It doesn't look very nice outside today.
You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining.
It's too hot.
I know, you're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.
I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.
That's exactly how I feel
I wish it was a nicer day today.
That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
Winter is great.
I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
I feel the same way.
It's such a nice day.
Yes, it is.
It looks like it may rain soon.
Yes, and I hope that it does.
Why is that?
I really love how rain clears the air.
Me too.
It always smells so fresh after it rains.
Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.
Really?
Why is it?
Because you can see the stars perfectly.
I really hope it rains today.
Yeah, me too.
Isn't it a nice day?
It really is.
It seems that it may rain today.
Hopefully it will.
How come?
I feel the same way.
It smells so good after it rains.
I especially love the night air when it rains.
Really?
Why?
The stars look so much closer after it rains.
I really want it to rain today.
Yeah, so do I.
Don't you think it's nice out?
Yes, I think so too.
I think that it's going to rain.
I hope that it does rain.
You like the rain?
The sky looks so clean after it rains.
I love it.
I understand.
Rain does make it smell cleaner.
I love most how it is at night after it rains.
How come?
You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
I would love for it to rain today.
I would too.
I really want to go to the beach this weekend.
That sounds like fun.
What's the weather going to be like?
I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
Is it going to be perfect beach weather?
I believe so.
Good.
I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
I know.
I really want to go to the beach.
But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.
You're right.
One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
I really wish the weather would just stay the same.
I do too.
That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.
A trip to the beach would be fun.
How is the weather going to be?
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
It sounds like it will be.
I really hope it doesn't get cold.
That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.
The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.
That is true.
The weather is constantly changing.
It would be nice if the weather would never change.
That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.
True.
Predictable weather would make life easier.
It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.
What's the weather going to be like?
I may want to go too.
The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
Will it be good beach weather?
I think it will be.
I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm.
This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen.
I know.
Every day the weather seems different.
I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
That would make it easier for us to make plans.
I know.
Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.
Hello, may I speak to Alice please?
This is she.
How's it going?
I've been trying to call you all day.
Sorry about that.
I was cleaning up.
It's okay.
So what were you calling me about?
Oh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.
Sure, what did you want to do?
Maybe we can go see a movie or something.
That sounds like fun.
Let's do it.
I'll see you tomorrow then.
See you then. Goodbye.
Hi, how are you.
Is Alice there?
Speaking.
What's up?
Why haven't you answered the phone?
My bad, I had chores to do.
That's all right.
What was the reason for your call?
I want to do something tomorrow with you.
Sounds good.
What did you have in mind?
I was thinking about seeing a movie.
Okay, let's go see a movie.
Until then.
Talk to you later
Is Alice available?
You're talking to her.
I've called you a hundred times today.
I was busy doing something.
I apologize.
No problem.
Did you need something?
Do you want to do something tomorrow?
Is there somewhere special you wanted to go?
How about a movie?
A movie sounds good.
Call me tomorrow then.
I will see you tomorrow.
Have you seen the new girl in school?
No, I haven't.
She's really pretty.
Describe her to me.
She's not too tall.
Well, how tall is she?
She's about five feet even.
What does she look like, though?
She has pretty light brown eyes.
I may know which girl you're talking about.
So you have seen her around?
Yes, I have.
There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?
I haven't seen her yet.
I think that she is very pretty.
Tell me how she looks.
She's kind of short.
What height is she?
She's probably about five feet.
That's nice, but tell me what she looks like.
The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.
I think I might've bumped into her before.
Are you telling me that you've seen her before?
I believe so
Have you met the new girl?
No. Have you?
She's one of the prettiest girls at the school.
What does she look like?
Well, she's quite short.
How tall would you say that she is?
I would say she's only five feet.
What about her facial features?
She has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Have you seen her?
I think that I have.
Why weren't you at school yesterday?
I wasn't really feeling well.
What was wrong with you?
My stomach was upset.
Do you feel better now?
I don't really feel too well yet.
Do you want anything to make you feel better?
No, thanks.
I already took some medicine.
I hope you feel better.
Thank you.
What reason do you have for missing school?
I was sick.
How were you sick?
I had a stomachache.
Did it get any better?
I'm still feeling under the weather.
Would you like anything for your stomach?
I took something earlier.
Get better.
Thanks a lot.
Why didn't you go to school yesterday?
I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well.
What was your problem?
My stomach was bothering me.
Are you feeling any better?
I'm still feeling a little sick.
I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?
That's okay.
I hope you feel better.
I'd appreciate that.
Did you hear the good news?
No, I haven't.
I got a promotion at my job.
Did you really?
Seriously, I am so excited.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm so happy for you.
Really?
Yes.
You really deserved this.
You think so?
Yes.
Good for you.
Have you heard my good news?
You haven't told me anything yet.
I got a promotion at work earlier this week.
Is that right?
It's the truth.
I am really happy.
Congratulations on your promotion.
Thank you very much.
I am really excited for you.
Are you really?
I'm serious.
You deserved this promotion.
Is that what you really think?
Yes, I do.
I haven't told you what happened yet, have I?
I haven't heard anything.
My boss offered me a promotion, and I took it.
Are you serious?
Yes, I am really excited.
That's great.
Congratulations.
I appreciate that.
You have no idea how happy I am for you.
For real?
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion.
I really do.
You look really nice today.
Thank you.
I just got this outfit the other day.
Really, where did you get it?
I got it from Macy's.
It's really nice.
Thanks again. You look nice today, too.
Thank you. I just got these shoes today.
Really?
What kind of shoes are they?
These are called All Star Chuck Taylors.
I really like those. How much did they cost?
They were about forty dollars.
I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair.
I absolutely love what you're wearing today.
You do?
I just bought this outfit a couple days ago.
Seriously, it looks really nice on you.
Where did you buy it from?
I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall.
I really like that outfit.
Thanks.
I think you look nice today, too.
Thank you.
I just bought these new shoes earlier today.
Those are nice.
What are they?
These are some Chucks.
Those are great.
How much were they?
I got them for forty.
I think I might go and find me my own pair of Chucks.
I think that you look very cute today.
Is that right?
This is a brand new outfit.
What store did you get it from?
I went to Macy's and picked it out.
I love your outfit right now.
Well, I think you look nice today too.
Thanks.
I found these new shoes earlier at the store.
I think that those are some really nice shoes. What kind are they?
These are Chucks.
Your shoes look really nice.
How much did you get them for?
They only cost me about forty dollars.
I'm going to go get a pair for myself.
Tell me, what do you enjoy doing in your spare time?
I enjoy drawing and painting.
You know how to draw and paint?
Yes, I do.
When did you learn how to do that?
I learned back in high school.
Oh, so you took an art class?
Yeah, I loved that class.
I see that you're pretty talented.
Thank you very much.
I wish I had a talent like that.
I'm sure you have a talent.
It's just hidden.
What kinds of things do you like to do?
I've always liked to draw and paint.
I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint.
I do it every once in a while.
How long have you known how to do that?
I first learned how to do it in high school.
Did you take some sort of art class or something?
That was my favorite class.
You have got to be talented.
Thanks.
If only I was talented.
You have a talent.
You just don't know what it is yet.
Are there any hobbies you do?
When I have time, I sometimes draw and paint.
Oh, you actually do that?
Every so often, I do.
Did you always know how to draw and paint?
I was taught in high school how to draw and paint.
You had an art class?
Exactly, it was my favorite class.
Well, it's good that you're so talented.
I appreciate that.
Talent is a great thing, I wish I had one.
Everyone has a talent.
They just need to find it.
What's your favorite movie?
My favorite movie is Superbad.
Oh, why is that?
It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen.
That's true.
It is a very funny movie.
You've seen it before?
Yes, I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters.
Didn't you laugh through the whole movie?
I did.
Me too.
That movie brought tears to my eyes.
Mine too.
I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it.
Sure, let's go.
Which movie is your favorite to watch?
I have to say, my favorite movie is Superbad.
Is that right?
Why?
Honestly, it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
You're right. That movie is hilarious.
I didn't think you saw that movie.
I went to see it the day it came out.
I was laughing through the whole movie.
I couldn't help laughing, either.
Same here.
I bought the movie. Would you like to come to my house and watch it?
Of course.
Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?
I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever.
You think so, how come?
Well, Superbad is super funny.
You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious.
I didn't know that you saw Superbad before.
I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.
I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.
I was laughing hysterically the whole time; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards.
That's exactly how I felt.
I got the movie when it came out on DVD, do you want to come over?
I would love to.
What type of music do you like to listen to?
I like listening to different kinds of music.

Did you go to the basketball game on Friday?
No, I couldn't make it.
You missed a really good game.
Oh, really?
Who won?
Our school did.
They played really well.
Too bad I was busy.
I really wanted to go.
Yeah, you should have.
It was really exciting.
So what was the score?
The score was 101-98.
Man, that was a really close game.
That's what made it so great.
I'll make sure and make it to the next one.
Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game?
I was unable to make it.
You should have been there.
It was intense.
Is that right.
Who ended up winning?
Our team was victorious.
I wish I was free that night.
I'm kind of mad that I didn't go.
It was a great game.
What was the score at the end of the game?

Sounds like it was a close game.
That's the reason it was such a great game.
The next game, I will definitely be there.

I really wish I went to the game.
It was the best game ever.
So tell me the final score.

It must've been a close game.
It really was.
You should've gone.
Hopefully, I'll make it to the next one.
What are you doing this weekend?
I'm going to the movies with a friend.
How about you?
I'm not sure yet.
Well, did you want to go see a movie with me?
What movie are you going to see?
I'm not sure yet.
Is there something you want to see?
There's nothing I can think of.
So, did you want to go?
No, thanks, maybe another time.
Okay, sounds good.
Do you know what you're going to do this weekend?
I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine.
What about you?
I don't know.
Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?

All right. Another time then.
You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend?
I'm going to the movie theater with my friend.

Not sure.
Is there a movie out that catches your eye?
No good movies come to mind.
Have you decided whether or not you would like to go?
No, thanks.
Maybe another time.
For sure another day.
Did you go to school today?
Yeah, I went to school today.
Were you there?
No, I didn't go, I've been sick.
That sucks. Did you want the assignments from English class?
That would be nice, thank you.
No problem, you're welcome.
I will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick.
Well, thank you. I hope to see you at school tomorrow.
Have you attended school today?
I attended school today. Did you?
I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Would you like the assignments from English class?
I would really appreciate that, thanks.
It's no trouble at all.
If you get sick, I'll return the favor.
Thanks.
See you at school tomorrow if you feel better.
Have you gone to school today?
I went to school today.
Did you go to school?
I couldn't go to school today, I was sick.
That's horrible. I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class.
Thank you very much, that's kind of you.
Don't mention it.
When you miss a day of school, I'll be happy to give you the English assignments.
That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow.
Did you hear the news?
What happened?
Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.
She did?
Why didn't anyone tell me?
I would've thought that somebody would have told you.
No, I had no idea.
Well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
Oh my God, that's great!
Are you going to go and visit her and the baby?
I think that I might.
Good!
I just thought I'd let you know.
Thanks for telling me.
Have you heard what happened?
Heard what?
Debrah already had her baby.
I didn't know that.
I thought you knew.
I honestly didn't know.
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
That's good to hear.
Will you go and visit them?
Of course I will.
I just wanted to give you the good news.
Thanks for letting me know.
Have you heard the news?
I haven't heard anything.
Debrah had her baby last week.
Nobody told me.
I thought you heard.
I really wasn't told anything.
She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces.
Wow, how exciting.
I know, you should really go and see her and the baby.
Of course I will.
I just wanted to let you know what happened.
I appreciate that.
Did you go to school today?
Of course.
Did you?
I didn't want to, so I didn't.
That's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently?
That's a switch.
I'm serious, have you?
No, I haven't.
Why?
I really want to go to the movies this weekend.
So go then.
I really don't want to go by myself.
Well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?
No, I think I'm going to go to the movies.
Did you make it to school today?
I always do. Did you go to school today?
No, I didn't.
You should have, but have you seen any movies lately?
That was an odd change of subject.
Maybe it was, but answer the question.
No, not recently.
I want to go to see a movie this weekend.
What's stopping you then?
I don't want to go alone.
So, will you be at school tomorrow?
No, I want to go to the movies instead
Did you even bother to go to school today?
Yeah, I went. Did you go?
No, I didn't feel like it.
That's nice, have you been to the movies lately?
No, but that was a random change of subject.
It may have been random, but have you?
I haven't lately.
I would love to catch a movie this weekend.
So then, why don't you just go?
I don't want to see a movie by myself.
Okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?
I think I might just go to the movies.
Thanks for coming to see me today.
It's no problem. I was really missing you anyway.
I missed you too.
Why haven't you tried to come see me then?
I've been really busy.
Doing what?
Working.
I would've come to see you sooner, but I've been busy too.
What have you been doing?
I've been working too.
Well regardless, I'm very happy that you came to see me.
I am too.
I'm really glad that you came to see me.
I had to.
I was missing you a lot.
I was missing you too.
So, why haven't you visited me?
I've actually been busy lately.
What have you been doing?
I've just been working really hard.
I've also been busy.
Tell me what you've been doing.
Basically, I've been working too.
Well whatever, I'm glad you came.
So am I.
I'm really happy that you came to visit me.
I really missed you a lot.
I've been missing you like crazy.
I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.
Lately, I've been quite busy.
Tell me what you've been up to.
I've really been working a lot lately.
I've been pretty busy myself.
So what have you been up to?
I've just been working a lot.
Whatever the reason may be, I'm glad you visited me.
I'm glad I did too.
Hey, did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend?
Yeah, but I'm still waiting for my invitation.
Oh really?
She gave me mine earlier today.
Well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today.

It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.
It really does, I can't wait.

I want to.
I heard it's going to be really fun.
I know, it does sound pretty awesome.
Well, when does the party start?
It's supposed to start at about eight.
How many invitations has she given out?
I really don't know, but I don't think she gave out that many yet.
I really want to go, so I hope that she gives me my invite soon.
Has anyone told you about Jessica's party coming up?
I was told about it already.
I'm just waiting for my invitation.
Is that right?
I already got my invitation from her earlier.
I believe that she will give me the invitation today.
Are you even going to go?
Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year.
Exactly, it seems like it's going to be loads of fun.
When exactly does the party start?
The invitation says it starts at 8:00 p.m.
Has she given out a lot of invitations yet?

Hey, what's up?
Nothing really.
I'm throwing a party on Friday.
I didn't realize that.
You didn't?
Nobody has told me anything about your party.
Did you want to go?
When does it start?
At 8:00 p.m.
I'll be there.
I'd better see you there.
Of course.
What's going on with you?
Fine. What's going on with you?
I'm having a party this Friday.
I had no idea.

It starts at 8 o'clock.
I'll go.
I hope that I'll see you there.
No doubt
What's going on?
Not much.
This Friday, I'm throwing a party.

Are you serious?
I haven't heard anything about it.
Can you make it?
What time does it start?
The party starts at 8.
Yeah, I think I'll go.
Am I going to see you there?
You will.
What's going on?
Nothing really, you?
I'm throwing a party next Saturday.
Is that right?
Yeah, are you going to come?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Why not?
I don't really want to.
Well, why don't you?
I hate going to parties.
Well, that's okay.
Yeah, sorry.
What's up?
Nothing, how about you?
Next Saturday, I'm going to have a party.
Oh, really?
You are coming?
Probably not.
Why is that?
I don't feel like going.
Why not?
I really can't stand going to parties.
I understand, I guess.
Sorry about that
What's happening?
Not a lot, what about you?
I'm having a party next Saturday.
That's nice.
Are you going to be there?
I don't think so.
Is there a reason why?
I just really don't want to go.
How come?
I don't really like parties.
I wish you would go, but that's okay.
I'm sorry.
What's up?
Nothing much, what's going on?
I'm having a party this Friday.
Oh, really?
That's nice.
I wanted to see if you wanted to come.
This Friday?
Sorry, I already have plans.
Doing what?
I'm going to dinner with my family.
I really wanted you to come, but I understand.
Yeah, maybe next time.
I'll hold you to that.
Sounds like a plan.
Hey, what's good with you?
Not a lot.
What about you?
I'm throwing a party on Friday.
That sounds like fun.
Do you think you can come?
I'm sorry.
I'm already doing something this Friday.
What are you going to be doing?
My family and I are going to dinner.
I was hoping you would come.
I'll definitely try to make it the next time.
I'd better see you there.
All right. I'll see you next time
What's going on?
Nothing really. How about you?
A lot, like the party I'm having on Friday.
Well, that's cool.
Will you be able to make it?
I'm busy this Friday. I'm sorry.
What do you have to do?
I'm having dinner with my family
Maybe you can come next time.
I'll make sure and come to your next party.
I'll look for you at my next party.
I'll be there.
It was nice talking to you.
Why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
I really have to go.
Why? I still wanted to talk to you.
I have things to do.
Like what?
Don't be nosey.
I'm not. I just want to know.
Well, it's really none of your business.
That's harsh.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
Fine.
I've enjoyed conversing with you.
Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?
I've got to go.
I wasn't done talking to you.
I have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey.
I'm not being nosey. I'm just asking.
I really don't think it's any of your business.
That's not nice.
I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
What's the rush?
I have to get off the phone now.
I'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
There are other things I need to take care of.
What is it that you need to do?
Please don't be nosey.
I'm not being nosey, it's just a question.
You don't need to worry about that.
That was mean to say.
I am very sorry, but I must go.
I guess.
Well, it was nice talking to you.
It was nice talking to you too.
We should really hang out again.
That would be fun.
Where do you want to go?
I think we should go out to eat.
That sounds good.
All right, so I'll see you then.
I'll call you later.
Okay, I'll talk to you later then.
See you later.
Bye.
I enjoyed talking to you.
I enjoyed talking to you too.
We should hang out some time.
I think that would be nice.
Is there anything you would like to do next time?
Do you want to go out to eat?
I'd like that.
So I'll see you next time.
I'm going to call you soon.
I'll talk to you later.
See you soon.
Goodbye
I had fun talking to you.
It was really nice talking to you also.
I think we should really do something sometime.
That should be loads of fun.
What do you want to do next time?
Would you like to go to dinner or something?
Yeah, let's do that.
Okay, until next time then.
I'll call you so we can set that up.
Talk to you then.
All right, see you.
See you.

Will that be acceptable to you?
It depends on the price, of course.

Maybe.
How much is a room?
The price per night is $308.
That sounds fine to me.
Fantastic!
Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room?

One minor problem, sir.
Our prices are now slightly higher.
Is that acceptable, sir?
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision.

That's a reasonable price.
Good! Now, sir, do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking?
I quit smoking, so nonsmoking.

$308! That's not bad.
Very good. Now, Mr. Sandals, about the room, smoking or nonsmoking?

Will that be okay?
Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay.

I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.
What time do you want the call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
We can certainly do that.
Expect a call from us at 7:00, and then again at 7:15.
Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7:30 am?
I can certainly do that.
Is there anything else?
I can't think of anything.
If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call again.
Okay.
Good night, sir.
I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning.
Of course.
When would you like the call?
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
No problem.
We'll give you both calls.
Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7:30.
No problem.
Anything else, sir?
Not at the moment, thank you.
Let me know if you do need anything.
Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow?
Certainly.
What time would you like us to call you?
I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
Not a problem.
We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7:15.
On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of 7:15.
Said, and done.
Will there be anything else?
No, that gets it for now, thank you.
Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with
Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.
Not a problem.
 What time shall we call you?
I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
It'll be our pleasure.
We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.
Oops, cancel that.
Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?
No sooner said than done.
Can I help you with anything else?
No, that's about it for now.
Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening
I need a wake-up call tomorrow.
What time would you like your wake-up call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
That is no problem at all, of course.
You'll get a call at 7:00, and another at 7:15.
Then again, I think 7:15 is too early.
Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.
So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30.
Do you have any other requests?
Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.
Okay, sir. Sleep well.
I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call.
Of course.
We can give you a call anytime you like.
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
Your wish is our command.
Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15.
Wait a minute!
I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it.
Change it to 7:30.
The second call is now changed to 7:30.
Is there anything else we can help you with?
Nothing that I can think of right now.
If something comes up, though, I'll call you.
We're here all night long if you need anything
