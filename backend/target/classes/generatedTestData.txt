Your life on Earth has ended, and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe.
Cool.
Oof.
That's how I died? No, sorry, there's more.
[chuckles] I mean, we couldn't believe what we were hearing.
That's him, actually, right up there.
Sure is.
[laughs] Okay, let's take a walk, shall we? Oh, did I have a purse? No, I'm dead, right.
There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.
Yeah.
- And welcome to your first day in the afterlife.
You were all, simply put, good people.
The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived.
And you won't be alone.
[applause] So who is in the Bad Place, that would shock me? Uh, well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basically every artist ever, uh, every U.
S.
Oh, it's perfect, isn't it? You see, in the Good Place, every person gets to live in a home that perfectly matches his or her true essence.
Cool.
This is your Human Rights mission to the Ukraine.
I mean, you got a ton of points for that one.
What about you? Uh, well, I I was born in Phoenix.
- Mm-hmm.
And now I want to say this.
Mm-kay.
" Eleanor, I swear that I will never say or do anything to cause you any harm.
Good.
I mean, somebody royally forked up.
Somebody forked up.
Which one's my desk? So your job was to defraud the elderly? Sorry the sick and elderly? But I was very good at it.
I was the top salesperson five years running.
We'll ask Janet.
Hey, Janet? - Hi there.
That's correct.
Well, that's fine, I wasn't that into him anyway.
I say we just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.
I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you.
Tell Michael about what? Michael? Hi.
What have you been up to? Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Isn't that right, darling? So we'll see you tonight? - Great.
- Yes.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment? Do you have a second to eat my farts? You missed.
[scoffs] Pick it up if you're so horny for the environment.
So we said, "If the U.
N.
But what you don't know is Golly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um, oh, what the heck? This is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.
I had been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project.
- Bravo, Michael, bravo! - Thank you.
Um, and I would just like to quickly say if any of you would like to play tennis tonight, we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts.
"I am just a big, beautiful, utterly perfect cartoon giraffe.
" Oh, okay.
Why aren't there stairs here? [groans] What kind of weirdo house is this? Ooh.
Did you fill your bra with shrimp? No.
It's not, though.
[sighs] Do you think anybody cared that I died? Maybe someone did.
[clears throat] You're a nice person, Chidi Anaconda.
Anagonye.
I didn't change it; it's my name.
Argrugande.
The part when I say I don't want ya I'm stronger than I've been before This is the part When I break free 'Cause I can't resist it no more - Michael.
- Mm? Is that giant, terrifying ladybug supposed to be there? Ah, well, great question, Tahani.
Ah, fork me.
Okay, okay.
So how can we be sure this is my fault? You hogged all the shrimp, and now there are shrimp flying around.
You called Tahani a giraffe, and now there are giraffes everywhere.
Look, apparently it doesn't work that way.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but there's nothing anyone can do.
Let me be your ethical guinea pig.
[knock at door] Hey, guys! Uh, emergency neighborhood meeting, now! We'll be right there, Michael! If I walk out of here in these clothes, I'm toast.
Um, Janet, I need quick question: can anyone access our search history, or is this an incognito browsing situation like when you're stalking a hot male man from your work computer? It is 100% confidential.
No one can access what you ask me, including Michael.
Here.
Yes, thank you, Janet.
Still not used to being in a human body.
And what do you do with sweat? Do do you lick it away, is that right? No, you dab it with a cloth.
Okay, I think it is time to make me good, partner.
How do we do it? Is there a pill I can take or something I could vape? Where did you get a chalkboard? It's the Good Place; you can get anything you want at any time.
Please, help me, man.
I swear I am worth it.
Do you not remember one single thing about me? Dude, things have been nuts around here.
I bet you don't know anything about me.
You are too selfish to ever be a good person.
Well, I think you're wrong.
- Let me see that.
- There's no need.
Flying.
[gasps and warm applause] Now that you're dead, let's live a little, right? Uh, sorry.
We need about, uh, 12 volunteers.
Oh! I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day.
Whoo! [woman laughing] - Hey! - [people chattering] Yeah! Whee! Hey, up there, having fun, or does it maybe suck, probably? I'd say it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms, but better.
How's volunteer garbage pickup? - About the same.
[sniffs] But it's also dead wrong.
This neighborhood is a disaster.
Michael could be heading for a total meltdown.
Soul mate, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Should we say it at the same time? All right.
- Isn't this great? - Um, yeah.
When I thought of the afterlife, I totally pictured being an unpaid, non-flying janitor.
Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt.
Yeah, but what do most great philosophers know? On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at.
Just hit me up when you're done weighing my life in your hands.
I'll just keep doing what I do best: being super considerate and selfless.
Good call.
Guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant loophole in the system I accidentally discovered.
It was my chance to prove myself, and now I've blown it.
You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is.
[gasps] [laughs] It's working! Ow! What the fork? [thunder crashing] Janet, any chance this is a scheduled trash storm? So here's the situation, Pevita.
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.
I'm making things worse.
Okay, all right, that's all right.
- [thunder crashes] - [screams] Oh okay, fine, fine.
My bag broke, and I ditched the trash instead of taking it all the way to the dumpster.
Oh, man.
[laughing] How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar? More cleaning up to do.
I'm a canyon full of poo-poo.
[sobbing] Jianyu, the architect of this neighborhood has just referred to himself as a canyon full of poo-poo.
[laughs] I'm back.
You did it.
Yeah.
No no, I meant I meant I it sucks that I can't do it more often, you know? I actually prefer it to drinking.
If you blow us off, you are banned from Thursday night drinks forever.
Yeah, I'm good with that.
You're doing this because you feel bad.
And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore because I told you that's not gonna happen.
Oh, wow, man, I swear I won't let you down.
Hi there.
Do you know what the best part about this place is? You figured out how to make a to-go cup that doesn't leak right where the seam meets the lid.
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.
You got a long way to go to pull this off.
It will take hours and hours of studying ethics and moral philosophy.
That's not a present; that's just common decency.
Yeah, but I forkin' nailed it.
And groping? [mouths] What? Hello.
Tahani.
[door slams] Ugh.
Tahani.
I'll I'll remind you that you're trying to learn how to be a good person.
Maybe you should return the favor and bring her something.
I'll have what she's having.
It's a work in progress.
You know, do things that you haven't done on earth, right? So why don't we meet tomorrow and try out some new hobbies.
Uh, why not? I'll I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Fresh pears.
It's a plant, just like your gift, but you can actually eat them.
What do you think is causing it? Oh, I'm sure I don't know.
But we must keep our heads up.
She is that kind of person and she did write it.
She wants everybody to think she's such a perfect princess just 'cause she's tall and glamorous and has cappuccino skin and curves everywhere and now I'm complimenting her.
[weeping] Hmm.
Yeah.
And as I raised nearly $60 billion, there was quite a lot of pennies.
[chuckles] But I also dabbled in some other professions.
And "Al-Jamil" means "beautiful," so my full name altogether means "Congratulations, Beautiful.
" Thanks, Eleanor.
Look, a journalist went undercover for an interview and recorded him.
Here, watch.
Honk! I mean, this guy's a monster, we can't support this guy.
Okay, hey, you're not better than me just 'cause you won't support a guy who grabbed a boob once.
Uh, but, uh, exploring makes me nervous.
I have what doctor's call "directional insanity.
I steered her away from colloquialisms and into "fun facts" and trivia tidbits.
I thought it'd be more in her wheelhouse.
Tahani, you're too sweet.
Isn't she just the nicest person? Mm-hmm.
Oh, they look a bit burned.
But they're not.
Yes, I know.
Uh, you never even named your dog, did you? When it ran away, you posted signs saying, "responds to long pauses.
They all truly belong here.
Oh, yes they do, cutie-pants.
This equipment is very scary! Don't be a baby.
It can't hurt you.
Um, but I just want to be an academic.
I want to keep working on my manuscript.
" You're a brilliant guy, Chidi.
But you just kept revising and rewriting and adding words to your title.
[fire crackling] Huh.
What do you think that means? You stole Tahani's diary.
Like with the plant, or when you literally made giant shrimp fly through the air.
I wrote myself the note.
Accept that.
Hey, babe.
Yeah, but shouldn't we just try? Shouldn't we just try to do the right thing whenever we can? Why? It's so much harder to live like that.
And it's not like someone's keeping score.
And also, maybe don't listen to me.
I would love not to listen to you.
Be proud.
I want to broaden my horizons and try new things, and I will.
Okay.
There you go.
I know.
You do.
Oh, thank you.
I really needed to hear that.
How are you, my dear, sweet bestie? Never better.
What's up? Well, Janet has been acting as my assistant.
[giggles] Eleanor, you and I could work side-by-side to figure out what's going wrong with this neighborhood.
Will you help me? - How could I say no? - Yeah, hurrah! - Hurrah! - [giggles] What now? [sighs] Relax, Eleanor.
Michael made a mistake.
But I'm trying, dude.
How have you managed to stay undiscovered? Because I have had to dodge and weave and barely escape with my life, and you don't seem like a super genius.
Hello, Jianyu.
Got to give it up.
Okay, I need to make sure that this isn't some sort of weird trap.
A nurse did that to calm me down once when I crashed my Jet Ski into a manatee.
You crashed your Jet Ski into a manatee? Yeah.
Okay, here's my biggest question: how did you know that I didn't belong here? I figured it out the very first night, at the party, using my powers of deduction.
I heard you don't talk.
You're not supposed to be here.
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
I was done.
Well, good, because of course I will.
[giggles] Tonight, I'm going to select my jauntiest suit, and I may even wear suspenders.
It's one of the human clothing items I'm most eager to try.
Excellent.
So, Tahani has no idea about me? No.
This is my bud-hole.
It's just, like, a hole where me and my buds can hang out.
Is she single, or is she married to Michael? No, no, dude, you cannot date Janet.
A: she's not human.
And it's really hard.
Also, Michael has asked me to be his assistant, whatever that means.
So I'll get right to the point.
I listened to your demo.
That's the dream.
It's your dream, man.
Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked every single detail.
Your restaurant opening is going to be the talk of the entire neighborhood.
It's just that, well, I looked at the guest list earlier, and Jianyu isn't invited.
Right.
Once again, none of these philosophers is ever talking about masturbation.
Let's move on to this week's main event, David Hume's "A Treatise of Human Nature.
That's why I'm doing it.
[distant music thumping] Do you hear music? That's not music.
I swear.
Eleanor, one hour ago, that man was a silent Buddhist monk.
[laughs] Am I going mad, or did I just hear you say, "I'm cool"? Mmm, mm-mm.
I don't think so.
I won't give him a second mouth.
Unless that would be helpful.
Obviously, it's impossible for something to be more perfect than perfect Well, it isn't, actually.
Any place or thing in the universe can be up to 104% perfect.
We just need a plan.
Oh, I got a plan.
Got it? [sighs] - [crowd cheering] - [music stops] Hoo hoo hoo! Oh, another great set, Jason.
They love you, dude.
I'm Mr.
Music, the DJ.
Fun! [laughing] [chatter] It's my Grandmother's maafe.
Fresh perch, slow-roasted in a peanut sauce.
- Hi.
I didn't get a meal.
How's Jianyu doing? Is he opening up? Mm, not yet.
But I can tell he wants to.
I'm sick of pretending to be Jianyu, the tofu man.
I'm gonna tell the story about my real favorite meal.
We need a distraction right the fork now.
No, no, no, no, no.
I know that may not be your number one concern right now, but It was up there.
It's real good soup.
Beautiful, beautiful Jacksonville.
What's wrong, dog? You look like you're freaking out.
I want it all.
That's big goals, man.
The launch was a disaster.
Poor Jianyu was so terrified that I fear he may never speak again.
Michael, I hereby rescind the tendering of my resignation.
We must keep the neighborhood together.
He's just gonna blab and get him and me both sent to The Bad Place.
It's hopeless.
He is putting himself in danger to help us, because he, unlike us, is an amazing person.
I didn't get into heaven to go to school.
Let's get crackin', Teach.
I read this entire David Hume book, and then I read it again because I didn't understand it the first time, and now I'm ready to go.
Cool.
I just have two questions: when are football tryouts? And does this school have a prom? Oh, no.
" Whoa.
It somehow tastes how I felt when my cell phone was fully charged.
I was at the frozen yogurt place and I didn't know what I wanted, so I turned to the guy behind me, and I was like, "Why don't you go ahead?" [gasps] Just like that! "Why don't you go ahead?" O-okay? Dude, you don't understand! I never did stuff like that when I was on Earth.
But now, thanks to your "good person" lessons, I didn't hold up the line.
I ran all the way here and it was so hot.
I mean, I will happily get it, because I told you I would.
It would've broken up my whole break dancing crew and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker.
So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards in Sheila's garage and called the cops.
Oh, you could, um, grade my paper I wrote on the concept of Dharma.
Six pages, and I didn't even do that thing where I try to make it longer by starting every sentence with "Interestingly" Sure, I'll do that and, uh we can start another lesson.
Tahani, dear, could you show us to a private room where no one can see or hear us, even if I yell very loudly out of fear? [device chimes] [gasps] It appears that the sinkhole is not repairing itself.
This is very bad, Janet.
Um, this is the reaction I have when things are incredibly mundane and expected.
I'm gonna leave now at my regular pace, as I do in most scenarios.
What's wrong? Out with it.
I'm just tired, need a break.
Oh, no.
I'm second to last.
It seems you're moving out of your structural period, and more into conceptual abstraction.
Good eye, Mother.
I wake up, there's Eleanor.
I spend all day teaching Eleanor.
As you all may remember, a sinkhole recently opened up in the town center.
The situation, sadly, has worsened.
We only get the welcome channel.
I would love to not watch TV, but you canceled school.
" Get your story straight, bro! [knocking] Hey, guys, it's Michael.
Hi, Michael, what a lovely surprise.
Somewhere in there.
Okay, bye.
2 million isn't bad.
It's very "middle-thermometer.
[applause] I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.
[crowd exclaims] The bidding shall commence at Â£3 million.
You could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.
And I did! [both laughing] It's called, "How to Spot Problems in a Marriage From 100 Miles Away.
It's pssh, snooze, am I right? [both chuckling] They're gonna catch us! This is an extremely precarious situation! I am vexed, Eleanor! A marriage counselor and a human lie detector isn't my first choice for company, either.
But they have no reason to suspect us! Plus, I think they may have actually just come here to, you know, swing.
No, Eleanor, look.
So how much of that did you hear? We couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert in non-verbal communication, and it is clear you are in conflict.
Eleanor, why don't you She never does the dishes.
I have to do them all the time.
It isn't safe to be out of your home.
Please go back inside.
By exactly nine days.
Tahani, this sinkhole is incredibly dangerous.
Okay, Chidi, out with it.
What is so unsatisfying about your soul mate relationship? Be honest, Chidi.
You know, Nina and I are skilled in the art of massage.
Uh, not erotic massage.
Why in the world did you go outside? Because I saw the rankings in the manual.
That manual is only meant to be seen by Architects and Janets.
You've got to be kidding me.
It says, "We bequeath the rest of our estate to Tahini.
[sighs] Oh, I'm sorry that I looked at the rankings, Michael.
But I just don't understand how I'm so low.
- [gasps] - It has? - Could it be - But how Did I? - "Tahani saves the un" - No, no, no.
Still not you.
The real problem is, that the more you help me, the greater the chance is that I can stay here, and me staying here means you'll never get a real soul mate.
- I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.
Go ahead, if you want, just here.
Whoo! See? You can jump up and down on it.
Huh.
How 'bout that? Well, as your assistant, I officially declare this good news.
Much better.
In five minutes, Michael wants my help investigating what's making the neighborhood go nuts, which is obviously me.
Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people are coming up with the rules for a new society.
Like if your Uber driver talks to you, the ride should be free? Sure, but anyone can veto any rule that they think is unfair.
So either I help him find the problem, which is me, and I'm doomed, or I don't help him, and then I'm behaving unethically and the whole world goes crazy and I'm caught anyway.
I need to figure out a way both help him and not help him at the same time.
Top of my game, actually.
Uh, here, let me just, uh Have a seat.
The person who has audibly promised to help you.
So you need to me house-sit the whole week? Sounds like somebody's gonna have a sweet vay-cay.
- Eleanor? - Yeah? This is gonna be a very stressful week for me.
I need to know that I can count on you.
What do you say? - Signs point to yes.
- Oh! Marvelous.
Well, if I feel sympathy for anyone, it's Tahani.
She's going through the same thing I am, but she doesn't know it.
Right? - Made in Taiwan.
- Yes, you were.
We're gonna start with the rocks.
Now, I've investigated all of the rocks in the neighborhood.
Look, I promised to help you, and honestly, the way I can help you is to force you to take a break.
And not working will help me work? Yes! Recharge the old batteries.
And also I will be joining them.
Great, and who is the other half of your couple? Oh, no, no, it's just me.
[robotically] Does not compute.
Does not compute.
[chuckles] That is very human.
Why do you need a human to be your assistant? I mean, aren't there more of whatever you are? Well, since we're becoming friends, like Ross and Phoebe Weird combo to pick, but okay.
And if this neighborhood doesn't work, I am in big trouble.
But more importantly, I promised all of you that you would be safe and happy.
Some time passed, and then it was over.
That's karaoke! Oh, let's do it again.
But it is a time-honored tradition.
Say no more.
We are road-tripping.
Oh, I can't! I promised I'd house-sit one more day, and I have to feed this stupid dog.
I'm ready to be a mom.
[relaxing music playing] I'm having trouble getting this mask to stick.
I had fun, I didn't think about my problems, and I won this ugly yellow toddler, - which is one of the most - beautiful things I've ever seen.
Thank you so much.
And do you like France as much as I do? Well, they enslaved my country for 300 years.
So no.
- We're just, uh - soul friends.
- Oh.
Oh! We need to celebrate! I know, okay Paper clip shower! So do you think we're looking for a man, or do you think we're looking for two men? Not sure.
We don't know anything about this person.
I'll add everybody who flew overhead.
Ugh.
" "Forget about it.
" This is where the sinkhole opened up.
My hoodie, please.
- What's happening? - I give up.
How was I supposed to know he would literally eat all of the food? It shouldn't have been an issue.
You were supposed to be there, but you broke your promise as soon as it wasn't convenient for you, and now I have a very bulbous dog.
I'm right here.
Oh, my gosh.
Of course.
You don't say things, but you do things.
To remember me by.
Thank you all for your patience with the problems in our neighborhood.
The problem is me.
- [all gasp] - And now I have to leave you forever.
I'm truly sorry.
- Janet? - [bell chimes] Please call a train to escort me into retirement.
What did you say to him? Did you make him do this somehow? Nope, this was entirely his idea.
Dude, this is good news.
There's an old Chinese proverb "Lies are like tigers.
They are bad.
Oh, thanks, Henry.
Whoa! New boots.
Those are the coolest boots I've ever seen in my life.
Thanks so much, buddy.
Oh, and here we have a piÃ±ata shaped like you, which is always fun.
By the way, uh, what's you're favorite color for the tablecloths? Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes.
" My soul will be disintegrated, and each molecule will be placed on the surface of a different burning sun.
And then my my essence will be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle and poured over hot diamonds.
The key word for tonight is just "somber.
" Jianyu, my love, we're gonna have to get rid of all of the party poppers immediately.
Can we somehow throw Tahani under the bus? That would be a classic "two birds with one stone" scenario.
Plus, I'd get her house.
I am the only one who can call the train, and it needs me to operate.
Choo-choo.
[sighs] Janet, high five, please? - Thanks, babe.
- [bell chiming] You cannot kill Janet.
Yes, I know.
You've talked about it for the last two days.
- You sit in on my class today? - Uh, I did, yeah.
Great lecture, by the way so bleak.
They're too expensive.
Sure you can.
Michael, as someone who didn't exactly have the steadiest parental guidance, I just want to thank you.
You were always there for us.
Speeches are over.
Michael's going to talk now.
" [chuckles] I wanted to eat a saltine.
Oh! I actually have some saltines.
Each new update of Janet gains more wisdom and social abilities.
Fun fact the first Janet had a click wheel.
Uh, no, that's not what that means at all.
Eleanor? Here we are.
So who's doing this, me or you? [stammers] I think I have to.
Um, being a bystander seems worse, somehow.
[inhales deeply] Eleanor? Eleanor, no, no, no.
Please, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[sighs] That's right, it's not real.
- Let's just do this.
Whoa.
What happened to Janet? She's she's dead.
We have to flee your crime scene.
Run! I have been murdered.
I know what you need.
Janet, can you get Chidi some weed? Oh, that's right.
Hello.
- [screams] - [all gasp] [gasps] Janet, you're alive! Hello, Architect, please enter your four-digit pin.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, her memory must have been wiped clean, so now she's gonna have to re-upload all the knowledge in the universe, which will only take a few days.
You got to admit I kind of nailed it.
All we have to do now is keep the secret forever.
[chuckles] Oh, well actually, um They let you wear your boots in here? They're the only things that bring me comfort.
What did you want to say to me? Oh, um just that I'm here and I love you, man.
Yeah, I know.
And I get it.
Janet, would you please recite the English alphabet? A-B Janet.
She knows her A-B-Janets.
You might be able to shrug this off, and forget about it, but I never will.
[somber music] Hello.
No, you don't.
No, um but please continue.
- Okay, easy.
I assume that this horrifying act is somehow related to the other issues we've had here.
 [melancholy music] [door opens] Eleanor, come on in.
Well, not often you get to confront your greatest failure face-to-face.
Location and date of birth, please.
Phoenix, Arizona, October 14, 1986.
- [tone chimes] Anything else? No, Janet, this is actually a cactus.
This might take a while.
And unless I can figure out a compelling reason to keep you here, you will spend eternity with murderers, and arsonists, and people who take off their shoes and socks on commercial airlines.
Mm, Janet, can I have a glass of water, please? - [tone chimes] - Here you go.
She caused a giant sinkhole into which poor Glenn fell.
She caused a trash storm.
And finally, a multi-part question: Did you ever appear on the American television program "The Bachelor" or its companion shows "The Bachelorette" and "Bachelor in Paradise," or post on any social media site that you were emotionally invested in any of the relationships the contestants were pursuing? No.
Okay.
I have Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
I do not have a cactus.
There's no such thing as a mistake in this realm.
And yet, you are, somehow, a mistake.
We've never really had a call for it before you, but in the interest of time.
Eleanor, did you murder Janet? No, I did not.
I'm amazing.
Bad news.
Yeah, I know we're in a miserable bind here, but this might be the proudest day of my life.
No offense, but that's a real bummer of a life.
You've been a big help.
[low tone] Listen up, genius.
I seek your wisdom in this moment of crisis.
What to do with Eleanor? Should I let her stay? Should I send her away? You think I should send her away? No, I should let her stay? Or no, I shouldn't let her stay because she doesn't belong here? Or no, I shouldn't let her stay even though she does belong here? Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom.
Oh, thank you, Jianyu.
You're free to go.
Eleanor, come back in.
Chidi, you stay here.
They came with unlimited ranch dressing.
Let's hear about the t-shirts, please.
All right, I gotta go to the DMV and pick up my vanity plates.
Ciao, bitches.
The legal fees drove the dry cleaner out of business.
Oh, boy.
She totally overreacted.
This is her fault.
No.
Do not tell me that you made t-shirts that said that and then sold them for a profit? Wish I could tell you that, bud.
Does it help if they basically sold themselves? I think you know it does not.
What did you do with the money? Gah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.
Come and get her.
[dramatic music] [dramatic Western music] What is this? What is that smell? Get out of here! Hello, Trevor.
You're Check this out.
- Huh? - All: "Dress Bitch"! It's pretty great, right? - Trevor - [laughs] Do you know what caused this mistake? 'Cause I cannot figure it out.
We gotta get back for "The Bachelor.
" I'm gonna be pissed if I miss the Rose Ceremony.
Just know you did everything you could to help me.
You're a really good fake soul mate.
Oh, hey, dum-dum.
You ready to go? Oh, you must be Chidi.
[dramatic music] This is the 3:18 to the Bad Place, making thousands of stops for literally no reason.
Now, you'll notice it's very hot in here, and it will get one degree hotter every time you think about how hot it is.
Eleanor is learning.
She's just doing it after she died.
Not with her.
Not yet.
What? I'm sorry - The other Eleanor? - Yeah, the real Eleanor.
The one that was supposed to be here but got sent down to us instead? She's on the train.
The "real Eleanor" was attending a conference on the death penalty, and you stopped by to pick up food for a local homeless shelter.
And "fake Eleanor" was there buying margarita mix and a magazine called "Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters.
The trash bag is ours - So, trash bag, let's go.
- Wh Let's hit it.
Fake Eleanor, a word? It's just me, man.
You can just say, "Eleanor.
Cool.
Well, welcome to Adobe High, home of the Scorpi-oties! Half the school wanted to be the Scorpions, half wanted to be the Coyotes, so we compromised.
I get your whole "mean girl" thing, and I'm all set with it, thanks.
In fact Listen up, everyone.
And anyway, there's a bigger problem: the Bad Place Crew they're all terrible bullies, and they outnumber me.
They even have their own Bad Janet.
I'll be right back.
Well, here's your house.
And if I didn't remember everyone's name, I got a very strong electric shock.
Yep, that was my pitch.
I don't mean to be a bother, but could I possibly get some water and whatever food doesn't turn to spiders in your mouth? Oh, of course, so sorry.
Let's get some dinner.
Yo, Good Janet.
- [beep] - Hi, there.
"I got to admit that does sound like me.
" - Oh, nailed it again.
Oh, and I think your grilled eggplant looks so good.
Should we - [together] Splitsies? - Yeah! [laughs] I can't believe you thought you could pretend to be Real Eleanor.
Oh, actually, um, I I'm not sure.
I never met my birth parents.
Am I right, Fake Eleanor? Please, stop calling me that.
Oh, you got it, third wheel.
Thanks, Jianyu.
I mean, it does matter if I know things, because I'm an informational delivery system, and I don't have a heart, but thanks.
[light music] Why did you do that? Because you're the only person here that's nice to me.
Okay.
Yeah, actually, we've had some interesting and in-depth classes.
He taught me about Plato - and Socrates, Immanuel Kant - Yeah, cool, shut up.
- [laughs] Well, please, show me everything.
You ready, Eleanor? I've seen it all already.
Cool, okay, well, I'll get tickets for the eight of us, and you can just pay me back in cash.
So you can get all the points on your credit card, and the rest of us get screwed? - No way.
Don't Don't All right.
Ha.
Oh, I think I made it pretty clear that I don't approve.
Hey, idiot.
But I read your file You don't belong here.
I mean, she spent her weekends breaking up dog fighting rings.
Oh, Tahani, I'm so sorry.
I will obviously clean all of this up.
You are smart, you are capable, and the time has come to hit "unfriend.
" I also told Mark to lose the "the".
We'll walk over together? You don't have to come, man.
I'm good.
Uh, I'm good.
You're turning it down? I just don't think I'm really one of you guys.
Good looking out, boss.
Peace! You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake allergy medicine.
Happy to be a part of the not-team.
It'll be a pleasure not hanging out with you.
Let's go, dingdong.
Come on.
Thanks, Real Eleanor.
Hey, if you two aren't gonna make out, just shut up.
If I'm wrong, you can take her to the Bad Place and punish her all you want, just really go to town on her.
Gah, gah, gah, easy, buddy, easy.
[Tahani claps] Hello, Jianyu.
You got sloppy.
What are you talking about? I'm ranking my favorite "Fast and the Furious" movies.
You said you wanted to know who I am, and this is the best way to get to know me.
You know what? It'd be one thing if you just weren't a Buddhist monk, but you're barely even a regular, functioning person.
How did you get here? I don't know, but, please, dawg, you can't tell Michael about me.
Regretted it immediately.
Bambadjan was a human rights advocate, so he and Real Eleanor will build a sort of legal argument.
[as Chidi] Oh, Eleanor, I have a stomachache because of what you did.
[laughs] He is such a dork.
Nobody asked you, Bambadjan.
I'm not sure what will work with Shawn, but we should have all our bases covered.
Let's let's start small.
Do you want to use a dry erase board or the regular pen and paper? Just pick.
You can't draft the teacher.
Pick a kid.
And he only stopped because he saw me timing him.
Granted, he laughed, and kind of made fun of himself, it was a nice moment, but still.
You didn't paint this.
You got Janet to do it.
This guy's famous.
I mean, who even are those ladies? Yeah, it would be easier to sort out the issue of dry erase versus paper if I could write down the pros and cons for each, but, of course, I would have to use one of them to write down the pros and cons for them, which is problematic.
Usually wouldn't even call or anything.
I'd just bounce.
Yeah, I love you.
Ugh, that's embarrassing.
Jianyu's a fake.
He's not supposed to be here.
Can I get a do-over? [light music] I need to step outside for some air, and I will not be back for many days.
Dude, you can't just run away.
- Hey, Janet? - [beep] Hi, there.
What are you watching? My greatest accomplishment ever.
Why are you so nice to me? Well, you were very nice to me while I was rebooting.
Also, I'm programmed to be nice to everyone.
Maybe if you lose.
If he doesn't pick me, I'ma start throwing stuff.
Listen, you and I have a weird, complicated, forked-up friendship, but it's our friendship, and I care about it.
Let's do something fun.
Okay, we did your thing.
Now it's my turn.
Right, it's one of those two people.
Well, I d I don't know.
Yeah, you know, maybe that's smart.
[laughs] How are you? Uzo, it's been too long.
Um, excuse me, excuse me.
I have decided I would like to unequivocally order the pumpkin soup.
Ugh, the dream.
And how exactly did you learn how to do this? When I was 14, I had to make myself look older to get a job.
We both love to dance, we were both banned from public transit systems in our cities.
I think this is the answer.
The answer is Real Eleanor.
- How do you know? - I don't, but the minute I said that, you knew instinctively whether it felt right.
Oh, boy, I mean, these run about 55 minutes a piece.
I'm really hot.
Yeah, here's the thing, bud: my wedding isn't for another month.
This was a test to see if you could handle being my best man, and, just as I predicted, you failed, miserably.
You're incapable of making a single decision.
Look, I know I can be indecisive, but what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes to find the perfect [clang] [dramatic music] Chidi? You're right.
It is a bit strange.
I'd like to read a poem.
- I want you to be my husband.
- Tight.
'Course, hot stuff.
I got your back.
An hour ago, I thought Jianyu was my soul mate, and the fact that that kind of made sense means you and I could never be meant for each other.
Plus, Jianyu's married to Janet now.
What? Oh, we would love to stay and chat, but we need to find Michael.
Eleanor, I think I figured out a way for you to stay.
We will apply the formula to Eleanor's actions here in the Good Place, and if you earn enough new points, then we could argue that you should stay here.
- Would that work? - Don't know, never had to prove someone belonged here before.
Wal mart? It's a place regular people go.
- You haven't heard of it.
Eleanor, everyone hates you.
Well, fork you too.
Oh, no, no, Chidi, that that's me saying that to you.
I love you.
I'm sorry, I've never kissed anyone before.
Is one tongue okay? I can add more tongues.
We gotta go public.
I hate all this hiding.
I know what we gotta do.
We're gonna rob this restaurant.
Think of this as an open forum for you to air any and all grievances that you may carry against her.
I was flying on the second day, and when you caused the trash storm, I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass, and it exploded.
It seems everyone's problem with me is me.
Yes, it would appear that way.
I'm married.
- To whom? - Sorry, my protocol forbids me from telling you any private information about any resident.
She makes the bass drop in my heart.
And Jason is a person who was near me, and then he asked me to marry him, and there is nothing in my protocol that specifically barred that from happening.
I also learned how to do this.
I will speak to you later.
- I love you.
I love you too.
You have a tendency to over-think things.
Turn off that giant brain, and just say you love her too.
I think I figured this out.
There is a real Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who took an oath of silence at the age of eight.
[ding] Did you ever have a personalized license plate? Yeah, dawg.
- "I LUV BUTTS".
I promise.
[light music] I don't know, B.
J, they're on to us, man.
His hat's a golf ball, and he's a got a terrible mustache.
Please, they'll listen to you.
Just pay me a few compliments.
Now, we shall hear from tonight's featured guest.
She's kind, she's humble, she's the Walmart of friends.
Like "nobody's perfect," but the letters switched.
- That's very funny.
- My motivation is corrupt.
Even when I do nice things, I'm only doing them so I can get something out of it, the ability to stay here, which means none of this had any real moral value.
Where you been? Oh, just walking around, contemplating my failure, wishing for the sweet release of eternal extinction.
Cool.
He pops out, steals the money from the restaurant, gets back in the safe, then you come in and uninstall it.
I refuse to discuss my fifth amendment rights until I concur with your attorney.
There were no air holes.
Plus he did a bunch of whippits while he was in there, which couldn't have helped.
I mean, what a family.
I'm just a dope who died in a safe with a snorkel who's only now realizing why that didn't work.
This is bonkers.
Okay, I have to go reboot Janet.
I'm not starting over.
What if he reboots me, and we fall out of love? We have to get out of here right now.
I was just about to call you to ask you to get me a train to the Bad Place.
- Whoa, what? - You have to be a good person to stay here, and I can't become a good person unless I leave.
Let's go hang with Mindy.
That sounds great.
Ooh.
- Michael.
I truly believe she's a good person.
- [train chugging] - Are you sure? Because I believe she's stealing my train.
21.
So, big plans this weekend? Yep.
You don't exist.
You're bothering me.
We're going somewhere that's not the Good Place, and it's not the Bad Place.
We're going to a Medium Place.
Oh, yeah? What things did he say were sexy? Lamborghinis, cool snakes, spinning rims, 20,000 followers on Instagram, girls with pigtails eating lollipops, latex pants, Carl's Jr.
ads, and sex.
What I will consider is the recent development - of Eleanor stealing my train.
- Now, hold on a second.
Clair live? I don't know.
I'm out of range of our neighborhood.
Hello, Mindy.
My name is Beadie.
You submitted a list of things you wanted; the Good Place provided those things.
Yeah, and the Bad Place made some modifications.
- Welcome to the Medium Place.
- So what's up? What's your deal? Are you single? - What's going on? - [static crackles] Sorry about before.
You guys have fun.
This is me and Janet's honeymoon, so we're gonna go try and figure out how to have sex.
- Good for you! And then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.
- Ooh - Honestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna kill me [chuckles] 'Cause I love cocaine.
I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time.
[chuckles] Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.
Oh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we Yeah, no, I get it.
Eleanor was supposed to be in the Bad Place, arrived here by accident, assumed another person's identity, and has now escaped.
Is that the whole story? Well, no.
I was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.
[deadpan] Eleanor is a magnificent person who has grown tremendously in her time here.
Her memories? As in, all the things - she's done on Earth? - Mm-hmm.
But perhaps we could take a little break first.
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography.
My friend in the Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics.
Yeah.
Hey, you two lovebirds figure out how to have sex yet? No.
We need to do something quickly.
Yeah, uh, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally? Ugh.
And it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement.
I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did.
[clears throat] Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.
The progress she has made does not offset her actions on Earth.
We do not know where you are but hope you are receiving this message.
You have been found to be the rightful property of the Bad Place.
We don't have to go back, though.
- they just said.
Or you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.
[slow motion] Bortles! [dramatic music] No! [clink] What are you doing, you goon? Trying to blow up the train.
Blowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged a ride-or-die protocol so I'm loyal to Jason forever.
Buddy Come on, we gotta go.
Me and Janet keep trying to solve the problem of how to have sex, which could take years.
Yeah, yeah.
You scored free WrestleMania tickets? There are no tickets, Mom.
I knew that was the only way I could get you here.
I just need you to sign it.
Emancipation papers? Honey! What does "emancipation" mean? It means I'll be on my own.
Well, if you want me to sign oh, that's a joint.
Uh, do you have a pen or a lighter? You're a really interesting person, Eleanor.
In preparation for your trip to the Bad Place, please put on these fedoras.
Oh, no.
But we're here.
We came here as fast as we could, and we're here.
You can decide.
You have 30 minutes.
Ugh.
Listen, we got the files for the new crop of incoming, and the Big Guy thinks it's time for you to fly solo.
This is your shot.
Good luck.
Okay, I thought you were gonna at least pretend to fight me on that, but whatever.
Hang on.
Chidi's done worse stuff than me.
He murdered Janet.
Well, I'm in love with this Janet.
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff which almost turned out to be sex, and we were married in a legal ceremony.
Well, I did a good job.
You mostly fell asleep in class or made fart noises with your hands.
Yes.
But no.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to contribute to your misery, it's just that I'm frightened.
I don't have an actual soul mate.
I will not.
It is literally impossible for me to do that.
Good-bye forever.
I will miss you so much.
I've been there, I know I can hack it.
Actually, I have kind of a rapport with some of the fire monsters.
Well reasoned.
Wow, Chidi is a terrible writer.
Working on your first solo design, right? How's it coming? Do you ever get the feeling we could be doing it all differently? I mean, it's always the same.
We get the names, come up with the design, they arrive, we move on to the next one.
I am.
- What? - Why? Real Eleanor is my soul mate or was my soul mate and she's only going down there because she thinks that I don't love her.
End of everything.
What? Now you're trying to replace Chidi? No.
- Hey, that's racist! - Not a robot.
Oh, you have some nerve.
Well, what about Real Eleanor? No, it's me and Chidi.
Call the train.
Oh, okay.
[chuckles] [door closes] Ready when you are, boss.
So she's right? Yeah, she figured it out.
No, this doesn't make any sense.
He convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.
He made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.
They figured it out.
- They - They know this is the Bad Place.
Four people, perfectly suited to make each other miserable.
I'm going to design an afterlife where they torture each other.
Let's try something new.
Too many variables.
How would this work, exactly? Oh.
Yes, all right, so [clears throat] This is a 14 million-point plan.
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice vacation from your full-time job.
Get your story straight.
Hey, guys? It's Michael! [groans] That was really a fun time.
Then it all started to go off the rails.
No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe for all of the neighborhoods, good and bad.
And apparently, this Janet is in love with Jason.
Which I did.
Couple of times, actually.
You were just the closest.
That makes me feel worse, somehow.
But that's for another time.
You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.
Just gotta get the boss man to sign off.
Wish me luck.
Look, for a first attempt it was actually very promising.
Let me let me just tinker a little, try again.
We figured it out once, we can do it again, because you know what, Michael? Ya bas [chimes tinkle] [door opening] Eleanor, come on in.
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Really? [laughs] Chris, you'll stand by me no matter what, right? Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out? I love working out.
After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth.
What? [dramatic music] What the fork is a "Chidi"? Why can't I say "fork"?
Hi there.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment? No.
- See? - Why are you like this? Excuse me? Why am I like this? You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.
- Go away from me.
- Okay.
I'm here to preside over case #00003 regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.
The Bad Place has sent Bad Janet to present their argument.
She was sacrificing herself because she is a wonderful, selfless - [crunching] - No, don't oh! - What's happening? - I should have warned you.
Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.
- Perfect.
[sighs] Well, let's try this way.
- What's up, idiot? Sorry I'm late, babe.
Hey, are you pregnant? - That's not possible.
Yeah, but it's always warm.
On your jukebox, you'll find every song ever sung.
[laughs] My kind of gal.
And I gotta say, you keep it tight.
I only cared about making money and doing cocaine.
One night, I had an epiphany, right? I needed to do something good with my life.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, I was just I was just kidding.
I was about to turn myself in.
No.
Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now.
No, thanks.
His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe he's on the train with Eleanor.
- You knew about Jason? - Yes, I know that he's a fake and that he's married to Janet and that this entire neighborhood is What's the human expression? Ah, yes, a smokin' hot turd.
[deadpan] Voluntarily heading to the Bad Place proves that she is a selfless person.
Sorry.
I've been asleep in goo for the last 29 years, so I'm good.
Call up the screen for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.
Look, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind.
Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can.
It was weird.
[speaking Spanish] [air horn blares] This ain't your bar mitzvah anymore, bitch.
Dramamine.
Helps with the nausea.
I, too, helped Eleanor.
Not as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice.
- Oh! - As concerning Jason Mendoza, I have heard no statements nor seen any evidence to suggest oh, he's from Florida? Yeah, he belongs in the Bad Place.
No, but how do you intend to enforce this ruling? You have no idea where they are.
- What? - What? You have four hours.
Good-bye.
They're our friends.
- We literally owe it to them.
- That's their problem.
Your problem is whether you get tortured.
Do do you have another bottle? Hi there, since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat.
- Ah, kind of like a last meal.
It's scary, like the movie "Ratatouille.
" - What? - Yo, I ain't trying to have rats living in my hat and pulling my hair to get me to do stuff.
No, it's time to own up, dude.
I spent my whole life acting like Mindy, me first, no matter what, and it literally took dying and being around a bunch of good people to realize that I was kind of a nightmare.
Eleanor, just because your father and I are divorced does not mean you can disrespect me like this, okay? We are a family.
Whose birthday is it? - Mine.
I work two after-school jobs because you blew half my college fund bailing your boyfriend out of jail.
So irresponsible.
[melancholy music] Wow, your parents sucked.
Yeah, they did, and I've been using their crappy parenting as an excuse for my selfish behavior all my life.
We surrender.
Together.
I established a deadline.
The deadline was missed.
I am in charge of all matters here for the next 30 minutes.
Bring me a list of the frozen yogurt flavors.
You're ready.
Oh, Dave, I'm gonna work so hard.
Somehow I blew it and well, you're all suffering, and for that, I'm deeply sorry.
This is truly the saddest day of my life.
Let's look at this ethnically.
For what I hope is the last time, it is "ethically.
He who smelt it murdered Janet.
Okay, well, it's settled then.
Okay, J-bones, you and me, outside.
What? But I'm not going.
This place truly is paradise.
- Look at them.
My brain will break.
I'm sorry, it's just that I have certain feelings for you.
Jason has agreed that the two of us should go.
- Bye, Tahani.
Sorry, that's how I ended most of my serious relationships.
Yeah, that checks out.
[both sniffling] All right, ready to go? Let's grab Michael.
[knocking at the door] Come in.
You belong here.
There's another reason.
Wouldn't be surprised if retirement were on the table.
Retirement? Course, what do I know? I'm just The All-Knowing Judge of All Matters in the Afterlife.
Yeah, I guess, but don't rock the boat here, pal, just try to do a good job.
[playful music] Mm.
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.
Chidi and I are going to go together, which means that you and Real Eleanor and Jason can stay.
Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it! Look, I love you and I think you love me.
What? Oh, man.
Wow! [laughing] Okay, okay.
I don't accept this offer.
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.
" And then it hit me.
They're never gonna call a train to take us to the Bad Place.
Oh, it looks like paradise, but it's actually a filthy dumpster full of our worst anxieties.
I'm surrounded by people who are literally better than me.
He played us like a fiddle.
You gotta give it up.
[groans] Man! This was supposed to be my big moment.
I just rehearsed that speech for, like, three hours.
Humans are very reticent to torture each other.
Even getting them to do simple things like pulling out each other's teeth is like I can't think of the right analogy.
That's what will make it fun.
I cannot predict everything that's gonna happen, but we'll improvise.
I thought we reserved the conference room.
No, Todd, we have it until 3:00.
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.
You had no idea I was gonna do that, because honestly, I had no idea I was gonna do that, Yeah, that came out of nowhere.
I mean, after that it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.
I know why Jason and I were sent here, but why Tahani? Oh, yeah.
Didn't you raise, like, $1,000 for charity, or whatever? Uh, $60 billion, actually, so.
I read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use - almond milk in my coffee - No, dingus! You hurt everyone in your life with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.
[playful music] Oh, fork! You're right.
Thank you, Chidi.
I really needed to hear that right now.
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.
Oh, Eleanor.
Quick.
Tahani, anything? Chidi, I need ya.
But you're way out on a limb here, Mike.
If this thing goes sideways again, you are done.
[upbeat music] You know the way you feel when you see a chimpanzee and a baby tiger who've become friends? [laughter] That's how you're going to feel every day.
Your medical relief mission to Kazakhstan, that really put you over the top, you got a ton of points for that.
Yeah, you gotta.
Once I'm back, we'll get to know each other.
You're in the Good Place.
- [sighs in relief] - Eleanor, you are my soul mate.
- [all gasping] - You have all done bad things since you arrived here.
The Bad Place is owed two people.
Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
I'm gonna erase your memories, make a few changes, and start over again.
You'll stand by me no matter what, right? Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out? I gotta stay jacked.
Project confidence.
There he is! How's it going, boss-man? Enough chit-chat.
I think this entire project of yours is stupid and doomed to fail.
I think you're going to be retired, eliminated from existence and burned on the surface of a billion suns.
That's an expression, Chuck.
All right, go ahead, Vicky.
I know that this kind of large-scale deception is not what you were trained to do.
There are gonna be days when you're just sick of being around these disgusting humans, with their weird, gross little mouths, and their stupid elbows.
Okay, Chidi, where are you? Or what are you? A type of soup, maybe? Hi there.
I'm Eleanor.
Duh! [laughs] There's no use for 'em.
I always prefer talking to people anyway.
Chidi? Are you Chidi? [otherworldly ringing music] Eleanor? What are you up to? Oh, hey there, Michael.
Just getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.
And as such, I was just hoping that you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party.
You know, just to introduce yourself.
Can I tell you something, - just soul-mate to soul-mate? - Hold that thought.
- I'm gonna head to the gym.
Me.
Neither.
I know.
Just don't ask me any questions about it.
[sighs] Ah, screw it.
Couple of quick shots [gasps softly] And then I'm coming for you, shrimpies.
[rushing sound] [door clicks open] Chidi? Come on in.
So there really is an afterlife.
But the point is: Chidi, you were way better than all of them.
You're safe.
But in your case, the system matched you with two other people.
It's a rare occurrence, like like a double rainbow, or someone on the Internet saying, "You know what? You've convinced me I was wrong.
- Um, so, so, so - Yeah? Yeah, so making decisions isn't necessarily - my strong suit.
- I know that, buddy.
A- Right.
Um You ready, Chidi? Here you go, Chidi.
Kind of makes you wonder what type of pizza they have in the Bad Place, huh? [both laughing] So, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane.
We must have just missed each other.
Just amazing people.
I'm surrounded.
[chuckles] - [laughs] - [laughs] [both laughing] [scattered, fading chuckles] Okay.
All right.
Do you look bad? No.
But good? Would I go as far as to say that you look good? Doubtful.
Hey.
How are you doing? Oh, well, uh [laughs] You know.
- Well, I know, but if the numbers were that close, AngÃ©lique, I think I'm supposed to Stop! Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.
[bright string music] These are for you.
I'm right in the middle of something.
Dude, I'm guessing we have about 30 seconds to talk before someone notices.
And that's your name, right? So, for some reason, at some point, I put this note into that whatever-lady's robot mouth.
- You already forgot her name? - No, I didn't.
Attention, everyone! [glass ringing] Speech time! I know you're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet, but if you are, please get me out of this speech.
[rushing sound] [door clicks open] Tahani.
I'm sorry, did I just say "short"? I-I meant to say "charmed, I'm sure," of course, because I am charmed to meet you, it's just an unfortunate Freudian short.
[giggles] Shall we? So, where did you attend medical short? So, this is the living room as well as the kitchen and the bedroom.
[magical ringing] Okay, I'll let you two have some alone time.
I will see you at the party.
Well, I best be getting changed for tonight.
- Mm.
Is that what you call a female plumber, or is it a toilet sweep? Or clog wench? [laughing sadly] In any case, that's how I'm dressed.
My darling, you are in the Good Place.
Really? Like what? [sighing] Well, my house is a bit small, which is fine, it's just not what I'm used to, and TomÃ¡s is lovely, but we haven't really "clicked" yet, to use a mundane colloquialism which I suppose I should do, now that I'm wearing [voice breaking] Cargo pants.
Tahani, it's very common to experience adjustment pains.
So no, no changes needed.
Okay, all right.
Oh no, no, I [laughing] Hey! Twinsies! - I'm sorry? - Look! Cargo-pants buddies! [chortles] I bet we have a lot in common.
I was a garbage man in Winnipeg.
Oh, no offense, darling, wherever you are.
Probably somewhere down there.
Look at that terrible placement and angle.
Is this your first time ever wearing a sash? Yeah, it is, but I think if we all just Well give it to me then! [shouts] [guests gasping] I got her off the stage.
You and Luang share an identical soul like binary stars, orbiting one another in a perfect, reflective harmony.
You won't ever have a single moment of loneliness, because you'll always be right next to each other for eternity.
Can I offer you two something to drink? - Janet! - Hi there.
This is Janet.
Never better.
Top of my game, actually.
How can I say no? [laughs] So cozy.
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.
I took this job because it seemed fun and different, and in the original version, I got to break Chidi's heart, like, 20 times, and it was great.
I mean, he was miserable.
- This is supposed to be the Good Place.
Why would Okay, I no, I hear you.
[glass ringing] Speech time! We're all good people, right? We all did the right thing whenever we could.
- If we all just - Well give it to me! [shouts] [guests gasping] Tahani? Are you all right? Yes, fine.
- All right, brag much? - No, I'm trying to help you.
- Sorry.
Tahani gave the drunken speech instead of Eleanor.
We can't build a chaos sequence out of Tahani's speech, because she thinks she belongs here ding-dong.
- What's up, guys? - What are you doing here? - Why aren't you with Eleanor? - Oh, I told her I was going to the gym again.
Why would you say that in the middle of a party? - You told me too.
I'm going to the gym! Fine.
Yeah, you do that.
I spent my life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the uni [gasps] Oh, no! I used almond milk in my coffee, even though I knew about the negative environmental impact.
- What? - Eleanor, what do we do? I don't know, dude! But we better figure it out soon, or we're doomed.
- Oh, yeah, "yurt" for short.
I was psyched to meet my new best friend, but he turned out to be this weird silent guy that won't leave me alone.
- Why did you do that? - Because you were nice to me.
- You're my friend.
- The first night in the afterlife can be a little overwhelming.
Don't worry about us, Michael.
That's okay.
You can just keep it.
There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.
Bye! - [short beep] [whispering] This is the wise monk who gave me the magic amulet.
I gotta figure out what it means.
Babe, there you are.
I've been worried Let me stop you.
Except according to this note, it's a prank show we've all been on before.
- What note? - Apparently, I wrote myself a note, and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth.
And to be honest I'm relieved.
At least there's an explanation for why this all went south so fast.
Well, as humans like to say, third time's the charm, right? [employees grumbling] I take full responsibility for the false start.
But I assure you all, there is no note this time.
- Questions.
- Maybe it's none of our business, but did you tell Shawn - what happened? - Yes, I did.
Eleanor got completely drunk last night.
She talked for, like, an hour.
And remember, there will be no attempt number three.
[digital beeping] [tense string music] Eleanor.
Cool.
I'm Chris Baker.
Gah! Oh, boy.
Hey, robot slave lady? Busty Alexa? - Oh, Janet? - Hi, there.
Apparently, the Bad Place knows that one of you actually belongs down there with them, and they want that person to get inside the obelisk, or they're gonna take all of you.
I can't go.
I'll go.
I deserve to go.
Ahh, farts.
Okay, attempt number 11.
Anybody else you got to teach me? You guys ready for our lesson? We're talking David Hume today, bundle theory of the self, baby.
Sounds like a real banger, but you guys gotta scram.
That was a real trip for biscuits, and now we're all wet, Daddy-O.
I never even got to play my stupid triangle.
Michael, you monster! Attempt 32.
Attempt 57.
This is your soul mate Greg.
This is your soul mate Glenn.
This is the Bad Place.
The pig's getting angry.
No, no, no! No, Michael! Please, please, calm down.
Calm down.
I just keep lying to him, and it's really bad, but I I mean, I have to keep trying.
I'm in too deep.
This guy sucks.
Who else you got? I can hear you.
Ow.
Okay, this might be the one.
I speak for the entire crew, Michael.
We're sick of it.
And you're gonna do 'em.
So Aristotle believes your character is voluntary, because, uh are you ignoring me right now? It's day two of our ethics lessons, and you're already tuning out? No, sorry, I just got distracted for a second.
You know, you guys aren't supposed to be smoking.
You're supposed to keep your human suit on.
This is the Bad Place.
I forking knew it! And clam chowder is disgusting.
- How can I help you? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How do we know she's not a part of it? We don't, but we gotta risk it.
Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either, bud.
I always assumed the afterlife was full of cool people, not talking sweater vests.
You've been here 15 times already.
What? Did you bring the cocaine I asked for? Please tell me you somehow remembered this time.
You can't even pull off those bow ties.
That was very mean, but I'm gonna move past that in the name of unit cohesion.
Down under.
Is it always the three of us? It's always at least Eleanor and Janet.
You always say that.
And you always end up going back.
"Make Michael think he's the one in the Bad Place.
Catch that magic panda.
What? I know it says here that we already tried throwing Tahani under the bus, but maybe we should revisit that.
Throw her a little bit harder.
You you are so mean, Eleanor.
You're just like those childhood bullies who said I would never get tenure.
I have listened to you talk about Chidi 15 times in 15 different ways.
Let me just cut to the chase.
And you don't need to respond 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel I love you too.
Very funny, but that that's obviously not real.
It, like, really killed the vibe for me.
See, after I watch the porno I made starring you, I watch you talk about your feelings to cool down.
No, Eleanor.
You guys have known each other a really long time.
What are my options? Do I have any? I mean, I can't go along with her plan.
It'll be a spectacular failure.
" That night, as the clock struck 12:00, me and my crew came together with a determination we had never shown before and slashed all their tires.
It was dope.
No, stop, no more lies.
Jason, get over here.
- What? - I want to team up with you guys.
What? Why? You do? What? I'm in a bit of a bind, and I could use some backup, or as Jason put it, um, I need a new dance crew.
The point is that circumstances have changed.
And now, all of us teaming up is our best option.
Look, I built this neighborhood as a way to torture the four of you psychologically for thousands of years.
And you keep figuring it out and taking all the fun out of it.
Ugh! How did we ever think this was the Good Place? Vicky thinks that she can run this neighborhood better than I can.
And she wants to start her version in 30 minutes.
My boss gave me two chances to make this work.
Suffice to say, I tried more than two times.
- Let me help you.
- [bell dings] [shimmering tone] Son of a bench.
I always trust dudes in bow ties.
Once, this guy in a bow tie came up to me at the gun range in a Jacksonville bus station and said he'd give me $600 if I put these weird turtles in my duffle bag and brought them to Daytona Beach.
- I agree.
He could be lying about this whole thing.
First off, how can we possibly trust you? You can't.
But you have to.
Uh, no.
Will they ever win the Super Bowl? Jason, I can't predict the future.
Boy, you guys barely know each other.
It's gonna make this tough.
There has to be a Janet in every neighborhood, good and bad.
This one is an actual Good Place Janet that I stole to help sell the ruse.
I was talking about my testicles.
Mindy St.
- Seriously?! How are she and I in the same place? - Oh, get over yourself.
- Trust me, don't trust me, it doesn't matter.
- Then you better get cracking on a new plan, pally, because so far, I haven't heard a single good reason why I should help you.
All right, how about this? You help me trick Vicky and all those other goons, I can get you to the real Good Place.
Please, sir, take pity on me, I've changed and all that crap, maybe I can earn a spot, too.
We didn't deserve the Good Place based on our time on Earth.
Are you forking kidding me right now? You take a half an hour to pick out a turtleneck, and yet this you're sure about? Okay, look, I spent my whole life trying to learn about right and wrong and apparently, I failed.
I want us to get better and I want us to stay that way.
So I think I'm gonna fast forward things a bit.
There's a very good reason why you ended up here.
But it might help you come to grips with who you really were.
Do you want to remember it? Tahani Al-Jamil, social activist, philanthropist, neck model and now cover girl for "International Sophisticate Magazine.
Remarkable.
Is there a question? Don't you find that remarkable? Kamilah is very impressive.
You have all the attention.
Once again.
[laughs] No! Ow.
Thing just ah! I'll bring you down! I will bring you down.
- Oh, come on, now.
It's not all bad.
Yet again, it's everyone against Eleanor.
Because everyone except Eleanor is an idiot.
- That's funny.
- We're cockroaches to you? Yeah.
So whatever Michael's reasons for doing this, he's giving us the best chance to improve ourselves.
Okay, I have to admit, you're making a lot of sense right now.
- Gonna bail, huh? - Hm? No.
Why why would you say that? Well, you got a bag full of clothes, you stuffed a bunch of pillows and a mop in your bed to make it look like you're asleep and you're literally sneaking out the back gate.
And who cares that it's only been a week? How long do you have to know someone before you - do the right thing? - Nine weeks, minimum.
- Okay.
We're not in a hurry or anything.
How many times in all the reboots did I ask Chidi for help, he refused to help me and then I had to get better on my own? Never.
Stuck with you and always helped you overcome your biggest problem.
Assuming that's my selfishness.
I think Michael is a liar.
I think there's a 99% chance he's forking with us.
We'll help you.
You finally listened to reason.
And who am I? Describe me now.
We are all going to take classes.
- I've only given this opening day tour to you like, 800 times.
Hey, how's this for my oh-my-God-I'm-in-Heaven face? - Not bad.
I got her to tell me how she was gonna torture you at the party, which is basically the same way I did.
Eleanor gets drunk, hogs all the shrimp, insults people, etcetera.
So I told Vicky that I would handle the surveillance on the four of you.
That'll let us meet each day for Chidi's ethics lessons, which will apparently include me.
- Not a robot.
We can do this.
[snapping fingers] You sure are.
Here are the torture ideas you asked me to write up for next week.
It just like popped right into my noodle.
[laughs] Yeah, that's right.
Coast is clear.
Not a demon in sight.
Let me just get into the mind-set of a human.
"Oh, I'm a human, "and my breathing tube is next to my eating tube.
Just like I'm the best at getting empty water bottles to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.
You know what? I am the best at planning parties.
" Model tonight's dÃ©cor after my 2008 fundraiser for the Red Cross in Zurich.
No.
Look, look.
If you live forever, then ethics don't matter to you because, basically, there's no consequences for your actions.
It's called retirement.
It's rare, but when one of us really screws something up [clicks teeth] And what happens exactly? Well, it's fairly straightforward.
Gone.
Nothingness.
This is good.
He's having an existential crisis.
How does anyone do anything when you understand the fleeting nature of existence? It's pretty easy, man.
I mean, you learn about death when you're a kid, and it's just not that big of a deal.
I'm lying, okay? You caught me.
Congratulations.
And at the end of that long day, I had to use one of my favorite duffle bags to do something very gross that I did not like.
Now, let's celebrate that dead dog's life by bringing Mommy another bottle of white.
Mike, listen to me, you have nothing to worry about.
You still have around 70% of your brain left.
Or you could just sit tight.
The entire party are going to be heading over here soon.
" Flying station's over there if you want to fly like a falcon.
[exclaims] And over there we filled a ball pit with puppies.
- Where's Michael? - [groans] [engine revving] Uh I think I found him.
There they are! Que pasa, muchachos? Hey there, bud.
Michael just asked that I change my appearance, and also say things like, "You're so funny," and "So how many quarterbacks are in a home run?" [giggles] Man, repressing your feelings is great.
I was feeling stressed all the time, and now it's just so easy.
I mean, they hit on you when they're drunk, and their breath smells like supplements, but overall they're pretty harmless.
It's Chinese for "Japan.
I mean the guy contemplates his own death for one forking minute and completely loses his grip on reality? [somber music] [whispering] You didn't have to come.
I said I'm fine.
Can you just chill? I don't want to turn Dad's funeral into a roast.
I'm not.
Well, we're at his funeral.
It's pretty clear I did! I won! He's dead! Up top! Whoa.
[unicorn huffs] So you all just stay here and have fun.
Okay, well, if that's what you want.
Or the Sharper Image Catalog.
What can't those guys ionize? By the way, I am feeling amazing.
Listen, when you guys first took over, I was upset, but it's all good now.
I mean, anger is toxic.
I'm too miserable to stay here for one more second.
Why? There are baby monkeys and dolphins to ride and the game of "Hungry, Hungry Hippos" with actual hippos.
Can't stop moving.
If I stop moving, I'll start thinking and if I start thinking, I'll start thinking about things I don't want to think about, like death.
I mean, emotionally, he's all over the map right now, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think this can be solved with a book.
What's the big whoop? I dealt with death, and I was fine.
A family pack? [dramatic sobbing] [clears throat] [solemn music] I don't know if what I'm going to say is going to hurt or help, but screw it.
Do you know what's really happening right now? You're learning what it's like to be human.
I've been there.
And everybody's been there.
And moreover, what's this say about me, about the life I lived? The way they're torturing me is through event planning mishaps, and it works.
Am I really that shallow? Listen, back in Jacksonville, I was in charge of a 60-person dance group.
Lately, you've been really down on yourself.
But you're the most amazing person I've ever met besides Michael, and he was constantly torturing us so I'd only rank him a ten.
"Excellent progress this week.
"Tahani devastated by party mishap.
[sighs] Surprisingly so.
But we should still discuss Want some breakfast? I know how to make cereal.
Now, you can steer to another track, but on that track is one person you would kill instead of the five.
What do you do? Do we know anything about the people? Like, is one of them an ex-boyfriend or that snooty girl from Rite Aid who was always silently judging my purchases? It's like, yeah, chicky, a Baby Ruth and birth control.
- Um, kill one, save five.
- Good! But there's a lot of other versions of this, like what if you knew one of the people? Does that change the equation? Or what if you're not the driver, you're just a bystander? Or let's throw the trolley out altogether.
- People good.
People good.
- That sounds fun.
- Right? But I was gonna dive into next week's reading, I'm afraid.
Right.
Then you can talk about why it is that you don't want anyone to know we're together.
He's not even a person.
He's just a bunch of evil shoved up the butt of an evil mannequin, you know.
But definitely a no on the rap musical? I mean, if we really [rapping] My name is Kierkegaard, and my writing is impeccable.
Check out my teleological suspension of the ethical.
Close enough.
Jason and I are sleeping together.
- Have a seat.
- [soft ding] Hi, I'm your therapist, Janet.
But I know for a fact that if you steal a loaf of bread, it's a negative 17 points 20 if it's a baguette because that makes you more French.
Okay.
I used what I called the "Duke Rule," because Duke is both minimum acceptable university and rank of nobility.
You've never dated anyone like Jason before.
That'll only slow things down.
Look, I'll tell you his side.
Why don't you just tell me the right answer? Well, that's what's so great about The Trolley Problem is that there is no right answer.
Ugh.
There are five workers on this track and one over there.
Here are the levers to switch the tracks.
[snaps fingers] [sighs shakily] [sighs with relief] [snaps fingers] Look.
See, buddy? None of this was real.
Thank you, Chidi.
So let's try again, hmm? [snaps fingers] Oh, uh, I-I thought maybe we would have a discussion.
Chidi! How are you, mate? Henry, move! - Oh, nice trolley.
- Move out of the way! - Henry, move! - I can't, Chidi.
And how does that make you feel? I just feel like Tahani's embarrassed that I'm not some sort of scientist who forecloses on banks.
I need another session with Janet.
Chidi opted to run over five William Shakespeares instead of one Santa Claus.
Okay, as much as I'm enjoying watching random people's heads fly off, I think we've taken this trolley thing as far as it can go.
I'm your friend.
I-I won't do it.
Oh, I know.
We'll do the one where you're in a boat next to a volcano, and you can either save 50 people, or one awesome dog or whatever.
I thought that was clear from my laughter.
Oh, come on.
You keep saying that we need you, or we'll end up getting tortured forever.
But then when we do help you out, we still end up getting tortured.
What he really wanted was to torture me, using the thing that I love most in the world.
Woven belts? Oh, teaching.
This is what he always wanted me trying desperately to teach him something that he never intended to learn so I'd end up miserable with my glasses all smudged up from sweaty-forehead stress grease.
Okay.
Therefore, quite good at sex.
Here's the thing.
Aw, I'm happy for you guys.
[gags] [frog croaking] Huh.
No.
[clears throat] No.
Eventually Chidi will get over it.
Ah! [laughs] Leaving it up to the other person to be the grown-up yet another classic Shellstrop move.
Thank you.
Tahani, here's yours.
- It is? - Yeah.
Jason, here you go.
This isn't an apology.
It's a bribe, and I'm not interested.
You want me to say, "Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry "because I didn't understand human ethics and you do.
"It made me feel insecure, and I lashed out.
It's white chocolate, and it is nasty.
Listen, we just wanted to thank you for all of your help.
I don't know why.
And it's getting worse.
[mechanical whirring] Oh.
Hello, I'm Janet.
And you just walked in and stole her? It was that easy? You didn't have to choke out an angel or anything? Doors were unlocked, no security.
I mean, it makes sense, right? They're good, so they're stupid and trusting.
Use the good one.
Janet, you and I are about to have a real adventure together.
Yeah, this is very bad.
Let's run a full diagnostic, Janet.
"Hello, and welcome to your new Janet.
"Janets are brought to you by the makers of light, darkness, and everything.
Can't you just reset these things? What do you do again? Oh, it's the ears, yeah? It's it's, uh It's down, down, out Vicky, can I can I speak to you just for a second outside? Look, this is a common problem, and I've got it under control.
I don't know, man.
No, actually, I had this great idea the other night.
Thought it was worth exploring.
Wonderful.
- So smart.
" Hop up on the table, there.
[quirky music] [To-do] All right, great.
A 14-ounce ostrich steak impaled on a giant novelty pencil that says, "Lordy, Lordy, I'm Over 40.
" Here you go.
[solemn music] This is all my fault.
I told you a lie that first day we met.
Top notch.
You're in luck here.
Michael's fine.
Sounds good, Michael.
Hi, guys.
I'm broken.
Aww, babe, you admitted it.
That's sweet.
Nothing to worry about.
Happens sometimes.
That glitch appears to be limited to this building.
- So Vicky won't know.
Interesting.
I guess I did.
No, it wasn't.
I'm always happy to help people.
When was the first glitch? When I said I was happy to give Jason and Tahani couples therapy.
And the second glitch? When I said I was happy to see them embracing.
I am not.
I am not that.
Sorry, I say everything in a cheery manner, but in this case it may be inappropriate.
So I'll try again.
"Janet will rapidly collapse in on herself.
"When Janet is roughly the size of a marble, "she can be launched into space "through an inter-dimensional suction tube or eaten as a midday snack.
So it looks like it's [slicing] Adios, Janito! Hey, guys.
Sorry to interrupt, um, but you didn't give me a heads-up about this new Vicky torture uh, the one with the needles in my face.
Marbleize me, Michael.
It's the only choice.
[melancholy music] Okay, that was the last pudding shop.
Great.
I can help you.
It's too hard to explain, but there are certain aspects of my plan that that you just can't understand.
[laughs] Oh, yeah, okay.
Let's make all these restaurants frozen yogurt.
Yes.
Sorry.
Okay, look, see, here here's the reason.
See, I promised the four humans that we would escape to the Good Place once and for all.
[melancholy music] You're my friend, Janet.
That's why I can't kill you.
Michael.
That was so nice of you.
Kill me.
No.
I mean, he's a ding dong, but also a straight hottie.
So, up top.
- Can you get drunk? - Not really.
Although, if I stand next to a powerful array of magnets, I do get pretty loopy.
Forget it.
But you don't need to worry.
And I should be able to avoid glitches by watching what I say around Jason and Tahani.
Ah, thank you for your help.
Take all the time you need.
[chime rings] - Hi, there.
Michael, Michael, Michael, Clichael, Clichael, Clichael.
Janet, you can't make a person.
Oh, my God.
I'm in there, too? What's going on right now? It's my first time making someone, so he might be a little bit off.
I'll miss you like crazy.
- I'll miss you more.
I'll miss you more.
Bye! That's my first time making someone so he might be a little bit off.
Babe! Don't be jealous.
- I love you now.
Already? I mean, that's so fast.
Well, when you know you know.
All this time indoors has degraded my skin from radiant to merely dewy.
Me? Dewy? Well, there is going to be plenty of sun and fun at the private campsite that I set up for you at the edge of the neighborhood.
" Again? You watch that movie a lot.
Well, it's basically my favorite movie of all time.
- Okay.
What if the reason you want to murder someone is to make your life easier? That's okay, right? Is there a problem here, bud? Okay, I'll just tell you.
Oh.
Did you do that because of what I said? Yes, because of what you said.
- Say "goodbye," Derek.
- Ah, good-bob.
" It's kind of fun I guess, but can I teach you a different game? In this one, you just whack it as hard as you can in whatever direction you want.
Jaguars rule! [glass shatters] The Jaguars are very good.
If we get rid of Derek, then maybe Janet will start glitching again Okay, if we can't kill Derek, then we've got to break up Jason and Tahani.
If that relationship ends, then Janet won't feel sad anymore, and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself.
I'll tell you what else would cause them harm, getting caught and being sent to the real Bad Place to be tortured for eternity, which will happen if Derek blows our cover.
I know, but we'll also be sent to the real Bad Place if we do bad things.
I went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School in Northeast Jacksonville, which was really just a bunch of tugboats tied together.
Didn't you get seasick? No, sorry they were tied together in a junk yard.
[chuckles] Okay, stop it.
No, no, no, I'm serious.
I'm stating a fact.
They are your friends! I don't know these people.
- Fine! - No, no, not fine.
Don't go somewhere else.
Oh, I hope Janet's back online.
- Janet.
I came here on purpose because this tree is my new house.
This is Derek's house, and Janet's not allowed in because I booby trapped it.
- No, no.
- Don't.
Your only goal has to be to spare Jason and Tahani from future pain by filling them in on Jason's past.
No, I got you, I got you.
Every day you teach me something new about art and history and why you shouldn't eat everything that smells good because sometimes, it's candles.
You're basically, like, a hot genius teacher who sometime has sex with me, your student.
I can't do it.
Professor Buzzkill got in my head.
At last we meet.
You've got a lot of nerve buddy.
Why don't you just reboot all of us? Tahani and Jason will forget they were ever in love.
It was a flukey thing.
I mean, the Doctrine of Double Effect, remember? Well, man, I'm working with a doctrine of not being completely effed, okay? I don't understand what you even like about Jason.
What does he have that I don't have? A soul and genitals.
Marcus? I always called him Ben.
Look, I gave you bad advice, okay? Jason was clearly important to you, and real heartbreak doesn't have a simple cure.
[groans] Talking about your feelings is the worst.
It's so much easier just to find a rebound guy and have sex about your feelings.
Janet, this relationship has been the best seven hours of my whole life.
It's been the only seven hours of my whole life.
That is some hot reabsorbing.
Can you get pregnant from reabsorbing? [wind chimes ringing] Uh-oh, I hear wind chimes.
Kind of like he's in power-saver mode.
Derek.
Cheese band.
Okay, okay.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
- About you.
I once even tried to rent socks.
How did I say that that easily.
Hey guys, sorry.
I know it's late.
I designed this entire torture chamber around the absolutely certainty that when the going got tough, you would give up.
That was the signature Shellstrop move.
"Don't use the fact that everyone's distracted to go back and steal more olives.
" - I get it.
Stick with the program, demon buddy.
I really feel like things are starting to click in our little study group.
I once even tried to rent socks.
Do you have any feelings like that for me again now? I'm sorry, but I I don't think I do.
Some people called you names, like "the Thomas Edison of incompetence," or "that dick.
" [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] But against all odds, it seems you've pulled it off.
Congratulations.
This is everything you've ever wanted.
I'd like to start by saying something I've wanted to say for a very long time.
Surprise, idiots! You're all in the Bad Place.
We'll be shutting this place down.
The four of you will be brought to the real Bad Pace, where your brains will be removed, studied, and batted around a stadium like beach balls.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
Janet? [GASPS] Oh, hi, you little cuties.
[GIGGLES] I love you guys so much, except for you, Jason, because I hate you.
No one can ever truly turn over a new leaf.
Sure, Ben Affleck told me he'd matured as an artist after he directed "Argo," but then, right on schedule, it was, "Guess what, Tahani, I'm gonna be Batman.
We know for a fact that the people from the Bad Place can't follow us there, and I vote for that.
I vote we No, sorry, and no offense, Jason, but the stakes here are too high to let someone with your limited intellectual processing capacity weigh in.
Keeblers car.
Kyra.
Michael was telling us to trust him.
I had a long talk with him the other night about the whole Derek incident.
They would call it a sit of doubting.
I never thought I'd be the one to say it, but this is getting out of hand.
Vicky, Vicky, this can work out great for both of us if we play our cards right.
Shawn thinks that this is attempt number two, right? Now, if I tell him that you've been in charge of this version, he's eventually gonna find out that there've been hundreds of failed versions.
Lucky for you, my friend, Jaguars games are the only ones televised in the Bad Place, because they suck! [LAUGHTER] No, they don't.
All we need is a defense and an offense and some rule changes.
This is exactly the place you should be.
Not super funny for a roast there, bud.
[LAUGHTER] You died alone because you couldn't commit to anyone who? - No.
- Jason Mendoza! [LAUGHTER] Okay, that's all my time.
We go to Shawn, and we tell him that we'll trade secret information about the reboots, if he'll go easy on us, and if that doesn't work, we try to get Janet free and head to Mindy's.
Agreed? Yeah, Michael sucks now.
Promise.
Now, you just relax.
I got it.
Ooh! Hey, help me get these bracelets off Good Janet.
- No I have some very interesting information about who's really responsible for this neighborhood.
Shawn, the humans are escaping.
Oh, Vicky, you didn't.
She definitely did.
You're not a demon.
You're a jerk.
- No duh.
- And as for Vicky - No, wait [SCRUNCHING] This is a PR disaster.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC] You guys! I was so scared for you.
[SOBBING] I told you he was on our side.
But then I figured it out.
Kierkegaard, baby! Leap of faith.
There's no way Michael would've forgotten the name Blake Bortles.
You say it a million times a day.
That was odd.
A host never runs off during their last song, because after it's over, you're supposed to act surprised when everyone drags you on stage and showers you with applause.
[GROANS] I'm never gonna find there he is.
- Derek.
Derek Michael wants us to stay here for some reason.
Eleanor, we have a train, a conductor, and a safe destination.
- All aboard! - [SHUSHING] The train is here.
- It's a train! - [BOTH SHUSH] Get onboard? - Actually, Derek - Derek.
Well, I mean, I actually left you more than 1,200 clues, because of how primitive your brains are, but I'm so glad you got enough to figure it out.
Wait, how did you escape detection, though? Well, I'm not ethically proud of this, but I framed Vicky.
I had to sell it, because everyone was watching.
- It was funny, though, right? - Absolutely not.
" There are wind chimes where my ding dong should be.
[CHIMES JINGLING] - I can work with that.
I have to design a complicated, unique, transportation vehicle.
- Is it Optimus Prime? - What? I can't believe we get to ride a real-life Optimus Prime.
I agree.
And although I believe I've asked - you this question already - There is no business class.
What was the name of your childhood pet? Korzoth, the ten-headed dog-spider.
And presto! [WARM MUSIC] - Dope.
Maybe I should've realized this wasn't the Good Place 'cause of all the diarrhea.
Maybe you shouldn't be eating all of that frozen yogurt right now.
I don't care where I live, as long as they have more of this frozen yogurt.
- Why? Why? - An unlimited library.
Each traveler will step upon the scale, and her soul shall be weighed.
If she's the best version of herself, it will permit her to board.
Relax, everyone.
We're all gonna be fine.
They're fears now.
Okay, I know this mood.
And how do I know that this version is the best version of myself? How do I know it's not version #85, or 322, or 558? Or 69, or 420? And then you get into the whole idea of consciousness.
And I mean just forget about best.
Now let's get you back on that scale, dorkus.
[CHUCKLES] Chidi, ready to try again? Yeah.
Should be the best version of myself now.
- [SCALE TOOTS] - [GROANS] Come on, scale.
Michael, can you tell us a little bit about that version? Reboot number 119.
All the restaurants were kabob places.
It's not for that.
Anyway, it just you know bloomed after that.
It is I, Tahani.
In case you were wondering, I am by definition the best version of myself, because my operating system is always updating.
No! My beautiful balloon scale! It's not yours.
No, no, please stop fighting.
I assumed if I bought myself some time, I could figure out a way in.
Guys, I tried a billion different ways.
I was stalling! So I could keep searching for a way in.
I would've been happy if you were to live in this neighborhood forever, but then Shawn came and just ruined the whole thing.
Completely out of options, are we? Not completely out of options.
We can do what the Shellstrops have always done when the chips are down.
You know my whole life, whenever I encountered any obstacles, I would simply say, "I would like to speak to a manager.
" But in our relationship, there was no manager.
Thank you, Jason, for making this moment a little easier for me.
["SITTING IN LIMBO" BY JIMMY CLIFF PLAYS] Dude, he's where I'm at.
Don't say anything.
Don't.
Or you came knocking on my office door asking for help with philosophy.
Is that how you think people meet? I don't know how normal people meet.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me, babe.
And I'll take it.
Because of the way we were conceived of and created, Janets don't typically give speeches.
Oh, she's done.
And you know what, it wasn't really Michael's fault.
We weren't getting into the Good Place anyway.
And we would like to present you with this human starter kit.
Car keys! So I could lose them, and say, "Has anyone seen my car keys?" I can do that you know that thing where [LAUGHS] Thank you! And Band-Aids for your stupid, fragile bodies.
Welcome to being human, buddy.
To Michael! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] [LORDE'S "GREEN LIGHT" PLAYS] [NAT KING COLE'S "UNFORGETTABLE" PLAYS] Unforgettable That's what you are - You don't remember? - No.
So random.
Okay.
In Autumn.
The off-season.
We should speak to the manager.
Wait, you said that there was a judge who decides on disputes between the Good Place and the Bad Place, right? Some sort of head honcho I could pace in front of and plead our case to and maybe even wag a finger at disapprovingly.
Let's do it.
You're serious? Yeah! What do we have to lose? All I've ever really wanted was to know what it feels like to be human, and now we're going to do the most human thing of all: attempt something futile with a ton of unearned confidence and fail spectacularly! Get up! Get up! Everyone.
[ENGINE HISSING] What up, idiot? This is the 8:22 express to Bad Place Headquarters.
We'd like to begin the boarding process with our first-class fat dinks.
In a way, the Good Place was inside the Bad Place all along? You know what? That's technically true.
- I'm gonna give it to you.
Yes.
See the Judge exists in a sort of neutral zone, separate from the Good Place and the Bad Place.
I'll get eggs, then.
So the only way to get to the Judge is through a portal, which is smack-dab in the middle of the main office at Bad Place Headquarters.
I had Janet make you each a Bad Place disguise.
And everyone who worked in the neighborhood has been sent back to their previous department.
I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work.
Any time I had a problem, and I threw a Molotov cocktail, boom! Right away, I had a different problem.
I actually dabbled in a bit of acting after university.
Although mostly I just stood around while Baz Luhrmann just threw glitter on me.
You cannot be Blake Bortles.
- Fine.
- I can't do this.
- Oh, boy.
How I've missed you.
Look, Eleanor, our goal here is to appear in front of a judge who is going to judge us.
What even is this thing? I hate suits.
They remind me of court and going to court and being my own lawyer against the advice of the judge in court and getting immediately convicted in court.
- Aww.
Janet, you need to get in character too.
Bad Janet, can I have a glass of water? No.
I would never give you that, you dumb person.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] All trains today are delayed by three hours, just like they are every day.
All passengers, you all suck, and you're ugly.
An area or location.
- It's pretty straightforward.
First person to floss in an open plan office? [MANNEQUINS WHIRRING] Well, she deserves to be tortured.
She's a monster.
I'm worried.
I mean 'cause you're our ticket out of here, genius.
'" This dude rules! All right, everyone.
We've got a lot of work to do.
It makes you smell the way "Transformers" movies make you feel.
Still can't believe those jagoffs got away from us.
Ah.
[JAZZY MUSIC] Oh, man.
I'm gonna get me a tall glass of piping hot corn syrup and a scooter, so I can roll around the mall.
- That's really good.
Ball tap! Oh! That was a firm ball tap, bro.
Anyway, your boy Trent and I worked together in partial decapitations.
Dude's a straight beast when it comes to torture.
- 'Sup, bro? - It's actually pretty choice that we're running into you right now.
You know I'd be all like, "No!" - But you know I can't.
- So weird, Trent, man.
A'ight.
Damn, you're good at this.
Hey.
Hi.
[LAUGHTER] That was sarcasm.
I had thought of that.
Your neighborhood Our neighborhood is being immortalized for its success.
It's all going to work out.
Jason is stalling by ranking MMA ring girls with them, but I have to do something.
Eleanor, you're wearing glasses now.
Take a breath.
Rub your lucky bookmark.
Go see "Chronicles of Riddick.
" Doesn't matter if your mom gets lonely and steals a bucket of Vicodin from the nurse's closet.
Let's roll.
[JAZZY MUSIC] Hey, butt ass.
Entering the bedroom.
- Oh, yeah! - Ow.
Looking good, buddy.
You lose some weight? [CHUCKLES] I wish.
I'm serious.
This one time I was assigned this a chick that I had to torture, and I just couldn't figure it out.
But I don't know, man.
Sounds kind of lame.
We have to get out of here right now.
All right, everybody.
- Want to meet them? - ALL: Yes! I'm Tahani Al-Jamil, a vainglorious attention seeker with enough jealousy to power Elon Musk's underwater mansion, which I've been to, by the way.
[LAUGHTER] I have, actually.
I've heard you say all that stuff.
I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
I got the travel pins! Yo! That looks like my boy Trent! And isn't that Rhonda Mumps? - Come on! - There he is.
And he's got the humans with him.
I don't have one! - Okay.
Okay.
But I don't think now's the time.
See, the trolley problem forces you to choose between two versions of letting other people die.
What's up?
[SCREAMING] [PORTAL WHOOSHING] [GROANING] That was Awesome! - I'm going again! - No.
Not even a mere toodleloo.
[PORTAL CLANGS] We're on our own.
Eh.
He could be right.
That's a burrito.
What's up, guys? Yeah, I did not think I had a case today.
Anytime anyone shows up in my chambers, the portal is sealed until I issue my ruling.
So, you guys can relax.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
That being said, sometimes I get bored and I cheat a little bit.
And the thing is, you didn't file any paperwork, and you have no advocate, and the rules say I gotta [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Send you back.
Your honor, please hear our case.
- Al-you-minnium.
- [GIGGLES] I love that! And I love your passion.
I did what I had to do.
Oh, you had to junk your jeans? [CLAP] How could you betray your own kind like this? Who taught you how to turn a human inside out by reaching down their throat and grabbing their butt from the inside? You did.
The point is, the four of them are in front of the Judge, and the Good Janet has escaped too.
You'll never find her.
Well, actually, sort of that way.
- Mrrup.
And if even one of you fails, you're all effed, right? Terrible idea.
I mean, truly awful.
- Using their archrivals, - the Tennessee Titans.
- No! If you play the game and you lose Oh.
All you have to do is go through there, walk down the hallway, and through the red door at the end.
That's it? That's my test? Yep.
I was just trying to prove that humans could be made to torture each other.
Instead, they helped each other and got better.
- They always do.
- I'm sick of smelling this guy's lumpy white ass.
You guys are in! We're in? What does that mean? You guys have made great strides and you made it to the Good Place.
- Congrats.
- You really do.
- [SQUEALING] Here's the thing, though.
Okay, obviously, this is the test, right? I bet the Judge gave Jason and Tahani the same offer, and whichever couple takes it, actually loses and the other two get in for real.
Oh! Diabolical.
Sorry, I feel weird saying this to an almighty judge, but you have hot sauce on your chin.
[MUFFLED] Thank you.
- What? - A choice that we have to make.
Yeah, you know, why can't one part of the calculation of our eternal fate be easy? [GRUMBLING] I don't know.
We were just talking about how you're a huge disappointment compared to your sister.
Have a seat, we'd love to get your take.
Apparently, wherever you've been, they've been keeping you well-fed.
You know, I've actually risked quite a lot to be in this room right now, so if you could just not be cruel for maybe 30 seconds, that would be lovely.
I was never going to be enough for you.
Never going to earn your respect.
I'm sorry we didn't have a better relationship.
And I wish you both the best.
All you'll have for entertainment is that giant stack of "New Yorker" magazines.
Oh, come on.
Janet.
I thought you were a marble.
Okay, our friends are going to the Bad Place, and us choosing to go with them won't lessen their suffering.
So, morally, we're allowed to go.
Wait, but what about the [DING] Well done, Eleanor.
You can take a seat and wait for the others.
Nope.
Brown.
But did I at least choose the right one? There is no right one.
They're hats.
[SPUTTERS MOCKINGLY] Now, Eleanor's test was about her selfishness, - and she actually - I failed.
I shoved an old lady down the stairs to get to the raw bar, 'cause I'm a shrimp fiend.
Every time they pull my eyeballs out through my mouth, I'll think of you.
[LAUGHS] I'm gonna frame that one.
[SIGHS] Good times.
All right, off to eternal damnation.
And think about where they started.
Uh, Jason, growing up in Jacksonville, what did you do for fun after school every day? Me and my friends whipped empty spray paint cans at flamingos.
Damn! That was intense! Look at my arm, y'all.
Look, I got goosebumps.
Anyway, I took a deep breath, told them I ate a Cheeto, and walked away.
Man.
This has been one of the craziest years of my life.
One of? Yeah, I'm not sure what I would do if one more insane thing happened.
All right.
Whatever.
Oh, no! Now the thing I said right after we kissed will always be "hot diggity dog.
" - [LAUGHS] - Whatever.
For the time being, The Judge is gonna put you in your own medium places, like Mindi St.
Clair.
- Yeah, give or take.
- Yeah? Somewhere in there.
Slow your roll there, Erin Brockovich.
First of all, y'all didn't get good enough to pass the tests I just gave you.
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
It's only four people.
Forever.
Mmm, mmm, mmm - okay, let's do it.
[GASPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Holy crap.
I just almost died.
And then someone pushed me out of the way, and the carts got, like, demolished by a truck.
I mean, I could've died.
I can't believe we all almost died.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop, and I think I might be a monster.
Tried.
Hard.
Yeah.
And? I can't be a part of it anymore.
You're wearing a wire? Yeah.
Company's being investigated for fraud, so I'm helping the feds bring everyone down.
I have a calcium deficiency.
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, man.
I didn't.
I apologize for being mean to you like a thousand times.
[APPLAUSE] Hi, welcome.
Nice to meet you.
Okay, guys, um, can I say something for a second? - I love you.
- Aww.
I tore your dress, and then I lied about it.
And then Brittany and I were the ones who made and sold the T-shirts.
Cool.
[GRUNTS] Okay.
Sorry, it's been a crazy month.
You know, moving was a hassle, and I'm in the middle of a lawsuit, and I ate vegetables for the first time, and I got diarrhea for, like, a week.
[GIGGLES] Mmm.
Yeah, that sounds like more fun.
I guess.
In like a sick Victorian boy kind of way.
Which one's my desk? [SIGHS] You realize what the problem is, right? Yes, but there's no way to help.
[CHORTLING] I'm only giving that guy three stars because he didn't let me stick my head out the moon roof.
- Last year on my birthday, I almost died, and then I did a bunch of stuff that was good, but weird.
And then I stopped.
The twerpy little twerps from the environmental place, they care, but I was a good person for six months.
That's like five years, and it felt okay, but not as good as I thought it would.
" And then when she started doing good things, that voice went away.
It was a relief.
What do we owe to each other? That is the question Tim Scanlon asked decades ago, and it is a question I will try to answer over the next three hours.
Ugh.
I'm going somewhere else.
[CALM MUSIC] G'day.
From the long, nerdy video about the little voice that tells you to be good? From the Cassat Foundation lecture series on the practical applications of ethical theory.
- Yes.
[GROANING] - Okay, let's do it.
- Yes! But there have to be strict rules.
It's kind of tricky, you know? It starts up a new timeline, so there might be some ripple effects.
But it's necessary for the experiment that we're doing there.
Or or no, maybe a sideways-facing seat.
I'm I'm going to get so motion sick! Oh, man! What do I do, just grab that key here Whoa, whoa, whoa! This key is made of the very first atoms that came into existence in the universe.
Knock yourself out.
[LIGHTLY TENSE MUSIC] Uh-oh.
I got to ride a bike.
I put a coin in a thing and got a gumball.
Now we just sit back and watch as they become better people.
Being good is for suckers.
I'm from "International Sophisticate Magazine.
" Mind if we ask you 582 questions? - Sounds delightful.
Do you think my name is the letter K? Just say yes.
If we're married, legally you can't arrest me.
- Michael, no.
I'm going to meet Eleanor someplace and plant the idea in her mind that she needs to find Chidi.
Need to head on back to Earth.
Travel papers.
It's only 4:30.
My shift doesn't end until 9 billion.
Our biggest exports are racist sheriffs and HPV.
But about a year ago, something crazy happened [KNOCKING] And I [BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH] Sorry.
I once got 12 out of 12 on a Buzzfeed quiz called "Do you know all the slang words the Kardashians invented?" - Congratulations? - Thank you.
I'm going to be honest.
And I know that seems zonk-atronic that's Khloe's word for crazy but I need someone to help guide me, morally speaking.
And I think I need it to be you.
Yeah, but I'm not your student.
I'm just some hot rando who walked in off the street.
I was frozen here, unable to make a single decision, and I almost got crushed by an air conditioner.
This is a sign.
Now what we do is we make a lengthy incision from your eyebrows to the nape of your neck, and we peel your face back, right, then slice your skull open.
And I just randomly stab at your brain with an electrified needle.
[LIGHT MUSIC] This is your hippocampus.
It regulates memory.
You philosophers can spend your entire life mulling over a single questions.
That's why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE] Wow, Chidi.
Well, that's the beauty of it.
Anyone can live this way.
But on the bright side, I lost control of my bladder.
Someone got it on video, and now "Leg Press Whizzer" has 62,000 views on Youtube.
Blueberry muffin for ya? Uh, I don't know, maybe.
I can't decide.
It's about perspective.
Sometimes, when you're feeling helpless, the secret is to help someone else.
Do you not do that? You can do it for free.
I got to say, I enjoyed playing the role of mysterious librarian, and I really [BAD ACCENT] nailed the Australian accent.
Can I just ask? We torture, like, 30 billion humans.
Why do you care so much about these four? [INTENSE MUSICAL BUILDUP] Never mind.
Choose something deeply terrible to inspire us.
Wherever you go Oh, yeah.
Oh, well, I'm headed that way, too.
I'll walk with you.
'" - Chidi, hey! - Hey! - I got a question.
Is it "What's my thesis topic?" - Because I still don't know.
And since you loved it so much last time, I was wondering if you could just pop back in there and help me out? - Oh, absolutely.
- Cool, okay.
You're both teachers who are hot for teacher.
[SQUEALS] How have you not asked her out yet? - Are you scared? - Well, it's not impressive to guess that I'm scared, Eleanor.
- What is one plus one? - Two.
- What color is the sky? - Blue.
Next question's for Simone.
Simone, are you annoyed at Chidi for waiting so long to ask you out? - Yes, I am.
Yes, I would.
Thank you for asking.
I've left too much to chance.
Until our group is back together again, this whole thing is hanging by a thread.
Nope, also weird.
Just go.
I'm getting close.
Good.
- Shut up, Glenn.
Morning, teach.
Also, not a great understanding of virtue ethics.
Oh, we can agree to disagree.
- Sorry, Reginald.
- Oh, no worries.
Tried on all his giant shoes.
One of my top five Christmases.
Also, I wanted to kiss you last night, but I chickened out, so I'm going to kiss you now.
Good, yes.
Oh, good, you're here.
Eleanor, meet the newest member of our ethical neuro-scientific study, Tahani Al-Jamil.
So how did you come to join our team? Well, it's a bit of a story, I suppose.
It, uh, began about a year ago.
That's what I call Prince William.
Since he'd married a commoner, I assumed he'd know some needy people they could go to.
I need to get out of the spotlight.
Copy that, I'll see what jets are available.
I worked.
I gave back to Mother Earth.
Look, here's my card.
Think about it.
No, they want you to take over for Oprah.
Also, this investor wants to meet you.
I'm sure you're already rolling in dough from this incredible scam, but have you thought about merch? Because we could, uh, we could partner here.
I made a fortune selling Nirvana Orbs, which is to say, driving range golf balls that I painted silver.
Al-Jamil, it's okay.
You and I are the same.
Al-Jamil doesn't have time to participate in an ethical study at some random university.
If you want to meet her, you can sign up for the "Get Out of the Spotlight" cruise, with special guests Deepak Chopra and Will.
Send me the info.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.
- Mm-hmm.
Three down, one to go.
You may have a few other obligations, but basically Uh, thanks, but no thanks, man.
- I'm done with dancing.
[GROANS] - Yo, what happened? - I couldn't breathe.
The snorkel must have been broken.
Why? Doesn't matter.
Continue.
Right now.
Yeah, okay.
We're going to do this the right way.
No more crime, and if you don't like that, you can walk out that door.
What? No, why? Because you have 40 people onstage.
The limit is eight.
Yep, he just confessed to the robbery.
- Damn it! - That was easy.
- A failure.
- You're not a failure.
Bro.
I'm only saying this because I love you.
But now, and I know this sounds crazy, but I'm starting to think there might be more to life than amateur street dancing competitions.
It's funny, but I know exactly what you mean.
No, go, go.
[WHOOSH] Well, that is the last time I'll need to head back down there.
Oh, this guy's a jumper.
You can tell.
I mean, everything is going according to plan, and nothing is going differently from the plan.
Yes, that's a very not weird way to put it.
- [GIGGLES] - You guys want to come with? - BOTH: Ooh.
- We can watch together.
Yeah, but we didn't, and more importantly, Jason just arrived in Australia.
The four of them are finally together.
That should be fine for me.
It's roughly the same size as Nicole Kidman's cryogenic anti-aging chamber, and I've never had a problem in there.
[TENSE MUSIC] This doesn't make any sense.
They're all there.
[HEAVY BASS NOTES]
Michael, a demon has infiltrated the group.
It's so nice to hear someone say, "Eleanor, you're the reason this is all happening" who isn't a judge in small claims court.
Thank you for this, Eleanor.
Got it.
Also, what a grim death that would have been.
Is it a spider? Yes.
Do you think taking a spider in an MRI machine will give you superpowers? Hey, it might work.
Whatever.
What are you doing here, Trevor? Shawn hacked the judge's system, and we caught you cheating, getting your four little cockroaches to meet up.
Dick Tracy called back on his watch phone and said you better "watch" out.
Shoot, second too late.
- Yeah.
We can check out Sydney, get to know each other, bond.
Oh, someone's seated there.
But if you purchase our Manifest Destiny package for $30, you can have anyone you want forcibly removed from the table.
- I get a sweatshirt.
"The Brainy Bunch.
Can I get you started with some drinks? Our specialty cocktail tonight is the Fourth of July.
It's half an apple pie blended with Southern Comfort and Coca-Cola served in a Chevy hubcap.
- Roomies.
- Roomies! That is technically an idea.
I like Jamaican food.
Listen to the reggae, and smoke the joints.
Giraffe.
Gah! Look what I've been reduced to.
Did he finish it? I don't know, and it's making me crazy.
I got to find him.
Excuse me.
Hey, El train, you think with all these new "Star Wars" movies they'll finally make a new "Spaceballs"? I'm sorry, I'm getting a text and I have to take this.
Could be fun.
I once played a drinking game with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively at their macrobiotic farm with a particularly robust batch of homemade kombucha.
All right, and I'm going to do my librarian act and nudge Chidi back to the table.
- Uh, yummy.
- I can't have that.
- Jeez.
It's me, the librarian from the library.
Oh, right, hi, sorry.
Ah, la-la-la-la.
Mm, I'm tired.
Um, there's only room for one male subject in an academic study, so keep the one who got there first.
Catchy.
You are.
I'm sorry, but this is just how it has to be.
Chidi's melting down.
Jason and Tahani just left together.
Ah, poop hands! I can't believe you fell for that.
Are you all right? You didn't sleep at all last night.
I've done a million of these things.
I promise I'll warn you if you cross any lines.
And it goes Attention, everyone.
Do not look at me.
Thank you so much for getting me home safely.
I wouldn't blame you should you ostracize me for my boorish behavior.
He's in limos all the time.
Oh, what a life.
It's outside.
Thanks.
That was really brave.
Now, I know we barely know each other, but, please, could you give me three months? Can you give me three months? I am I am asking you as a friend.
Said that I was right about Eleanor and Chidi having an unbreakable bond.
I don't think you understand how that joke works.
Now? Right now? Um, like, all of us, or Yep.
So, this is Earth, huh? Whoo, that's pretty cool.
Now, granted, I also tricked the doorman and snuck down to Earth, but what are we gonna do Do you realize what you did? You meddled in human affairs.
That ripples out, man.
Blake Bortles is kind of okay, maybe.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you intervened in human affairs.
I mean, because of you, Byron Allen owns The Weather Channel now.
Buckle up, folks.
Let's go, right now.
[suspenseful music] [door whooshes] Okay.
That was an insane thing for us to do.
That's impossible.
It's a magical key, you dick.
Only the Accountants have that information.
But I did install cameras and microphones, so at least we can keep our eye on them.
" That was me.
I wrote that email.
Great news, everyone.
The funding from the neuroscience department - came through.
- Fine.
Oh, you guys, let's take a picture.
If Eleanor has to get a job, she'll miss class, and that will slow down her progress.
Are you sure we should be doing this? It kind of feels like cheating.
Keep going.
Keep going, keep going.
This morning, I found a lottery ticket on the ground outside my apartment, I scratched it off, and I won $18,000! - Wow! - That's amazing! Better luck next time.
Yes, sorry, from context, I see that is actually a large sum of money.
I enjoy American football.
I actually dated a player once.
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, boy.
- Great idea.
- Oh, you know? This is not as crucial to the mission, but I'd also love to arrange for them to get better computers.
Of course I remember you.
We dated.
I'm like a rock.
Ugh, stupid Larry! - Stop talking about rocks! - No, no, no, Larry, please.
Go to her.
Go to her! [soft whimsical music] Looks like you had a good night.
The we had intercourse.
- Yeah, again, I always get it.
Well, I don't know about every aspect.
SuperBoard, activate! Good morning, professor Anagonye.
It's very last-minute.
Just come as you are.
Anyway, everyone, I want you to meet Larry Hemsworth.
Oh, the legendary study group.
You're important, too! Fixing babies' spines is just as valuable as acting.
Tahani booked a flight for tomorrow morning, so this party is our only chance to talk them out of moving.
Vegemite canapÃ©? Ah, might as well.
[sighs] Mummy was right.
You should stay here in Sydney.
It's such a dynamic, international city that you've only seen 4.
Hate to say it, but the group probably needs a new member.
I don't know how we'll ever replace Tahani.
They'll do my left side for free, so.
[somber music] No, no, no, no, no! The whole group is splintering.
Boy, I know how that goes, not wanting something to end, feeling like your little team is the last thing standing between you and oblivion, that at any moment, the universe could fold up around you, and squeeze the last breath from your dying lungs.
You're a caterer, right? It's a very competitive industry.
I get that we all have meaningful lives outside this study.
Well, Tahani and Chidi do.
No, you don't need to say it.
I I got it.
- [all gasp] Eleanor, please! [mocking accent] Oh, sorry, the deed is done.
Pip pip, too late.
Then, I saw my friend hiding behind a plant, and I got concerned.
Then, my friend lashed out at me again, so I'm gonna take off, and uh, leave her here with dirty leaves in her hair.
Or a binky.
That's a solid burn.
That's why we have racism and nationalism and why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin hate fans of The Rock.
No, we hate The Rock because he went Hollywood, and Stone Cold keeps it real, so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis.
The other possible medical diagnosis is that you're just a bit of a dick.
[both laugh] [bright music] Why don't you take my cab? I think me needs to go apologize to us.
Each summer, we can all stay in one of our respective houses, mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you.
We should all meet up in Jacksonville.
- [exhales] Okay, I think I've figured out a plan where they stay in Australia, and only five random bystanders get hurt.
- It's called arson.
Correct.
I know everything.
Do you even know how to reset the timeline on Earth? No, I'm assuming that there's, you know, a knob, or or a button, or you know, maybe you maybe you unplug it and then plug it right back in.
I I don't ca there's got to be a way.
What are you doing down here?
What the hell is that? Oh! Hey, guys! What are you doing down here? Well, we came to get more champagne, which is right behind that magic door.
Just give me one second, okay? How do we get out of this? Well, they heard us explaining the entire system of the afterlife, and they saw an inter-dimensional door open and close, so not a ton of wiggle room here.
But you're forgetting one, crucial piece of information Right? You're forgetting one crucial piece of information that'll save us.
[suspenseful music] I knew it.
Agent Fuqua and I are paranormal investigators.
Who's Janet? Frenchy.
Sorry Frenchy's nickname is Janet.
Just give me one more second.
One.
[sighs] It's over.
[solemn music] Ah.
So sorry for eternally dooming you.
And that's our bad, guys.
Sorry.
I'm my brain is melting.
So you get it.
This broke me! The dot, over the I, that broke me.
- Not if I see you first.
- Let's go, Jason.
? - No.
- Why not? Well, because it's not really my birthday.
I need you to act as my bodyguard like my friend, Kevin Costner, in that movie where he was a bodyguard "The Bodyguard.
" No problem my cousin once hired me to do crowd control for his off-brand SeaWorld.
Lovely as it sounds to add to my collection of wings and atria, the gift will be anonymous.
As you wish.
"God remains dead, and we have killed him.
"Who will wipe this blood off us? "What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent?" Friedrich Nietzsche, 1882.
So A man i fes to.
by mi Where's the H? This keyboard doesn't have an H.
Look, there have to be rules.
Every place has rules.
Yeah, in America, everyone does whatever they want.
Society did break down.
Just take it.
Take it, Eleanor.
If you're gonna go see him, could you bring it along? Of course.
I would love to bring some rando his mail.
Do you guys have, like, a "take-a-car, leave-a-car" tray? No? Just take it.
Just take it.
Now you can buy a bigger chin guitar! This was a truly great plan.
Oh, thanks.
We're technically supposed to shut down the bank if anyone from Florida even walks in.
Look, all my life, this money has been a weight around my neck like the Heart of the Ocean necklace my friend James Cameron once gave me.
I have all your crap.
- Thank you.
I started a new job a few months ago, and I got really nervous.
So my daughter, Carolyn, drew this for me to make me feel better.
Come on.
Dip your paws in my chili.
Next, there's consequentialism.
The basis for judgment about whether something is right or wrong stems from the consequences of that action.
And now I'm gonna eat my marshmallow-candy chili in silence, and you all can jump up your own butts.
Is that gonna be on the test? Yes.
Feeling all right? - I feel fine.
- Hmm.
I added all the data we've gathered here on Earth - in chart and in graph form.
- Hmm.
[gasps] Hey, guys.
It it's really nice to see you.
So the four of us the six of us, really, are doomed.
Our fates are sealed.
I mean, why not try? It's better than not trying, right? That's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor.
Let's try.
- [scoffs] But first, I have to go to the bathroom forever.
There you are, my love.
- Didn't like you.
Huh.
Who are we saving? No one from my high school, I will tell you that much.
Well, before we do anything, I have to break things off with Simone.
You're damn right they didn't.
I just wish I could end things in a way that I knew wouldn't hurt her.
[pleasant music] Jacksonville, what up? - Duval! - ALL: Duval! Poor Larry.
But "If you love someone set them free.
The Donkey Doug with whom you tried to blind airline pilots with laser pointers? - Yeah.
- The Donkey Doug who's banned from Disney World for biting Buzz Lightyear? In his defense, he thought it was someone else.
A few years ago, Donkey Doug was very close to getting his electrician's license.
So if we get him to finish the training, he can earn an honest living and be on his way to getting more Good Place points, which is why we're all here.
" But not like Yes, yes, we get it.
Thank you.
Wow, that's the first time that line has ever failed.
You must really love him.
They'll play a tone that will trick your brain into seeing what I've programmed.
[electronic beeping] Ah Wow, so this is - I'm here.
- Which is it? - I-I can't because of - [sighs] Janet! - Who's Janet? And why are you screaming her name into the sky? You know what? Whatever.
- Good-bye, Chidi.
I got a business proposition for you.
Pillboi! - Oh, dip! Jason! - Oh, dip! Pillboi! - Oh, dip! Pillboi! - Oh, dip! Donkey Doug! - Oh, dip! Jason! - This is remarkable.
And this time, it's not fake meth.
All right, Pillboi, tell him about our new product.
We should bid fast.
The other sharks are gonna want in.
It's like, get over yourselves.
Is there any way I can try a bunch of different things in a row - to see what works? - Bing.
What? Hang on.
[snaps fingers] [sighs] I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm dying.
Nope.
[snapping fingers] Simone the last year has been truly amazing, and with that in mind - Will you marry me? - Yes! Yes! Of course I will! Oh! [applause] Wait, what am I doing? Why did I think this would work? Chidi, I'm gonna go ahead and reboot this one myself.
Remember everything.
Right leg crossed over left.
- Thank you.
- Psych! It's still Eleanor! I can't believe you fell for that, you doink.
Yes, please.
- Do that for me.
- And your accent is so cute.
Your accent is so cute.
Also, and perhaps this is less important, but there's an awful lot of dog hair on the furniture, and I have not seen a dog.
Not bad, right? Double Trouble comes in three delicious smell-flavors: Raspberry Perspirant, Cedarwood Melon Blast, and 24-Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme.
You're his dad.
This is huge, J.
Why was I friends with him? Maybe this is what'll put your father on the right path.
And, hey, it's not like he's robbing a bank.
I mean, two factories I can understand, but but three? You you might want to consider the possibility that your father's a lost cause.
I have an idea, but I need your help.
Wish me luck.
[exhales forcefully] - Oh, hi.
Hello.
Will you be eating with us today? Just please give us one second.
Ya dumped.
- Okay.
Take half of one of these, wash it down with a 5-Hour ENERGY, and you'll be golden.
Body high with mild visuals.
That's it? You don't need any more information? I mean, do you want to tell me? - Not really.
- Cool.
Just go.
Be a person.
If you're here to tell me an energy drink body spray is a bad idea, I've heard it before from a bank and some doctors.
I'ma help you make Double Trouble, but you got to leave Pillboi alone from now on.
It's the cops.
What do we do? Yo, let's get out of here.
And someday, you'll do this exact thing for your son.
I mean, I hope not, but thanks, Donkey Doug.
And my feelings have changed.
I wish I could tell you why.
So your covert mission is to continue to report to this job until you receive our signal.
Now, this is the most important thing.
[sniffles] I love you, bro.
[both crying] - Psych.
I never got to do that with my parents, and now they're both dead, so it's impossible.
So the thing is, one of your parents is not technically actually dead.
I promise.
A police officer came to my home and told me that my mom had been accidentally trampled to death when she bent down to adjust her toe ring at a Rascal Flatts concert.
What the hell, Mom? Okay, baby, I can explain everything.
Let's all just take a breath.
Okay, now this is making sense.
You change your name, bag a rich loser with a tacky house.
Hi, I'm Dave.
- Michael.
- [giggles] I can't believe I have to wait in line to see my own sister.
I have never waited in any kind of formation before, let alone a line.
Ugh.
Maybe we should just go.
As a frog stares up in awe at the tree top, so, too, does humanity gawk at the purity of a blinding truth.
Napkins and forks are in the back.
[laughs] So, Michael, what do you do? Ah, well, uh, I'm an architect.
- Get out of here.
7 shots of Seagram's 7 in 7 minutes.
It's Diana's morning drink.
" Oh.
[chuckles] What a fun way to say a normal thing, right? Well, I've got to go get ready.
And I'm not even a tequila guy.
Wow.
That one's got a bunch of colors.
That's got to add some value.
Why are you in my room? Oh, hey, girl.
What's up? How old are you three? - I'm nine.
She's a kid.
You can't disembowel her toys.
The Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead in this suburban boredom factory.
She's scamming them.
Give me a break.
Until Kamilah accepts my apology this open wound will hinder any progress she might make toward getting into the Good Place.
I got distracted.
She's amazing.
[laughter] Savage.
Hello, I'm Diana Tremaine.
Oh, I know your name.
I'm calling you a mark.
That was mostly sex.
[chuckles] Your mother is a very confident and selfish lover.
Well, listen, she has been nothing but honest with me.
And I like that she's got a wild streak.
No, no way.
Why can't you accept that she might be living a good, honest life? That she's an attentive partner and a good mom? Because I wanted that mom.
I don't really understand the job.
Listen, um, I'm sorry that I didn't think this whole thing was real.
No.
No.
Really? You don't think they would be proud of her for having a whole museum wing dedicated to her work? My parents' standards were incredibly high, and they were impossible to please.
Plus, they always pitted my sister and me against each other.
You're the boobs? Sorry.
Once Jason said it, that's all I can see.
[sighs] [sighs] They were wankers, weren't they? Ah! The absolute biggest wankers on Earth.
Let them go, please.
Ya basic.
No, Mom.
You're happy here.
But you need to commit to this which means getting rid of that stash of escape money.
It seems like you've turned into a really good person, and you clearly didn't get that from me, so props to whoever helped you.
Is there more cash in your bra? Always.
Yes.
Smart.
Oops.
Ah, just a little oversight.
You get it.
The others are on their way back from Budapest.
I never even told a boyfriend I love him.
Oh, crap.
Fire up Janet's memory gizmo.
Flooding your brain with memories from the afterlife is dangerous.
Luckily, before we shut the neighborhood down, Janet saved a complete record of all the reboots.
Put those in your ears.
[DEVICE BEEPS] As I told you, recalling afterlife memories here on Earth has some significant side effects.
You should be back to normal in about 20 minutes.
I'm skipping all of the sleeping and chewing.
You guys are always either sleeping or chewing something.
Two months of philosophy class, and you're already [SNEEZES] What are you grinning at, weirdo? [LAUGHS] Come on, we're gonna be late for the neighborhood meeting.
I gotta say, it seems - like I was really nailing that philosophy class.
Fabulous.
I haven't had a pet since Barbra Streisand gave me one of her cloned Siamese cats, and it killed itself.
- [CHICKEN CROWING] - [DOG BARKING] Ooh! This one looks just like the one I had when I was a little kid.
He's so cute! But is is this one a little a little cuter? I mean, this pup looks friskier.
Oh my.
I mean, should I take the cutest puppy, or is that shallow? And is it even okay to separate them? Are they brother and sister? Or or perhaps, married? Dude, they're heaven puppies.
My indecision has once again cost me happiness, and I will now suffer the consequences.
How many pets have gone unclaimed? Three.
Janet made him a little cowboy hat.
Isn't that stupid? [GIGGLES] - Chidi? Hello? - Shh.
- Instead of - Ow.
Deep wounds.
Yeah, no, you're right.
"Not that interesting.
Can I ride your centaur? I'm afraid T'Hania's quite particular about whom she allows to ride her.
I tried, and she gave me a withering stare.
Tonight we're having a party where everyone gets to transform into their pets for a few minutes, as a treat.
Chidi can fly like an owl, and you can do whatever lizards do.
No big deal.
Janet can find it.
Lizard? Lizard? Where the fork are you? [SOFTLY] Lizard! Ugh! Why didn't I name you? - Hey.
- [SCREAMS] - Why? - Oh! Oh, no! Chidi! Sorry I shoved you, man.
You're amazing.
[TENDER UPBEAT MUSIC] After that, you spent all your time together.
You're capable of human love.
Congrats.
And love is stronger than anything you can throw at us.
No, it's not.
I forced you to choose the lizard, and then I made that lizard run away.
I made it all up! Don't you understand that? This [SNAPS] That's why I didn't want to give you your memories back.
I'm not mad at you.
I can't be mad at a demon for being evil.
Okay, yes.
I put you and Chidi in close proximity, because I needed you to drive each other crazy.
That's ridiculous.
I didn't make you kiss Chidi by that lake.
I'd take off if I were you.
The second we close, they use this place to shoot pornos.
Easy.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] - Okay, here's a perfect example! - [LOUDLY] In the very first attempt - Dude.
I beg you, tell me.
Hey, I love you, man.
The only reason I cared enough about Chidi to do that, was because you forced us together, made me feel bad for causing him pain.
- Okay, yeah - Yeah.
I mean, that's worth watching.
[SOFT LAUGH] It's great.
- - I know all your private shames, like that you don't wash your feet in the shower; your first concert was Barenaked Ladies; and you have frequent sex dreams about Sam the Eagle, from the Muppets.
Well, he's very authoritative, and I find that reassuring.
What? We don't know.
Maybe there's a mega-demon who built a torture chamber for demons, and this whole thing is just him torturing you.
Disagree.
I think it's the coolest thing I've ever done.
And I want to believe that it matters.
So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna use my free will right now to go pick up our friends at the airport.
Oh, I call window seat! [TENDER PIANO MUSIC] [DOORS SHUTTING ECHOES] I'm sorry.
You were right.
Take the Soul Squad to the next level somehow.
You're right.
It's it's someone way cooler.
Hey, everybody out of the car! Grab your bags! We're going to rural Canada! [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - Is it ready? - I guess.
Where am I? How long was I in there? You have missed a lot.
Now go through that makeshift portal.
- Hello.
Hope we have the right house.
Some people in town are saying you live a pretty interesting life out here.
Growing your own food completely off the grid? We would love to do a human interest story about you for the paper.
Great, great.
Oh, hey, you know, before we forget.
The next day all I could do was watch kung-fu movies and stroke a blanket that I thought was my cat.
But soon after, I designed a life that would maximize my point total and help me get into the Good Place.
Stars.
They really are just like us.
Let me know if you're not happy with them.
I have ice cubes if it's too warm and a koozie if it's too cold.
I mean, saving souls feels great, but Sydney to Budapest to Phoenix to Calgary I'm so jetlagged, I can't even regrender my chorf.
Don't even know what I was trying to say.
It's lovely.
Tell me about Chidi.
Everything I eat I grow myself.
The radish patch was actually here when I moved in.
There are no rules.
I am 100% sure there are.
I got five million points.
Damn, how'd you get so good at this so fast? So, in this whole other timeline, Chidi and I said "I love you" to each other.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
I've been mauled several times.
Oh, this little guy here might look innocent, but boy, he goes right for the squeaker if you know what I mean.
Watch.
Hey, give that guy your shoe.
That's how the system works, remember? Go get your shoe, idiot.
[CHUCKLES] Be right back.
That's just mostly because Eleanor and Jason made a bunch of dirty jokes about it.
It's a criticism of utilitarianism.
Thank you.
We're gonna head out now.
Forgetting someone's name that's definitely lost me some points.
Hey, you know, I've always secretly wished my name was Mark.
- Yes.
I mean, "no.
And I don't know exactly how to say this, but you and I are Bambadjan.
You know, I never thought about it before but yeah, we are kinda Bambadjan.
No, no, no, no, actual demons.
Like, from the Bad Place.
Now, where's Michael? We are here to celebrate the life of Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore, the snail.
I named him/her that posthumously because I imagine him/her to be the greatest and most talented snail ever to have lived.
Happy, slimy trails, old friend.
I'm sorry, I've got to leave right away.
But can I maybe give you just a little advice? I know I should donate more blood.
I'll try, but the last time I went down there they said I was so anemic, they ended up giving me blood.
- Sorry.
The point is, I have never met anyone so dedicated to making other people and snails happy.
You know, travel.
Drink regular water that wasn't inside you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk to Edmonton to give $85 to a snail charity.
Why don't you just take us to the Bad Place already, dude? Because I want to see the look on Michael's face when he realizes he failed.
Ah, Doug is a complete disaster.
And I drank his piss.
If you want them, you're gonna have to go through me.
That's the idea.
En garde.
Obviously, I'd never do that in a competition.
[WHOOSHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [BOTH GRUNTING] [GIGGLES] Three hundred points best score ever! - [PORTAL HUMMING] - [SCREAMS] Is it just me or is Janet a straight-up hottie right now? How are you this close to being dragged to Hell and still horny? I don't know.
And how did you know they were demons? I can't tell you that now! Screw it.
In Canada during this brawl with demons.
Let's get her to the door.
Yes, but I had the, uh Thank you, Janet.
How did you get down here? We have the only key to the door to Earth.
Now, why would you think that? Just a hunch.
And do you know what else I had a hunch about? - No.
Evidence isn't a good thing that you want.
It's a bad thing that you have to destroy or you go to jail.
Michael, Michael, Michael.
[PANTING] I forgot what you asked me to get.
Cool.
That sounds fun.
How's the hair? Is it still amazing? Michael, there may have been some side effects for the humans.
Huh.
And when you say "void" Oh, I mean a sub-dimension outside of space and time at the nexus of consciousness and matter tethered to my essence.
Does that help? It does not help.
Janet's void has a back door to the Janet warehouse in the Neutral Zone, which is right near Accounting.
You four will stay here while Actual Janet and I sneak through it and find the Head Accountant.
We're almost at the end, guys.
Just stay here, keep Janet's heads on straight.
- End of conversation.
- My name is Michael.
Well, we are white.
Let's all say white people things! Billy Joel.
We're Janets now.
So I thought we'd have some bitchin' Janet powers.
End of conversation.
Hi.
- Yeah.
- So what can I do for you? - Well, I'm concerned about certain anomalies in the point system.
We don't get a lot of visitors.
Follow me.
Philosophically speaking, there's the Chidi I am, who lived a certain life, and there's the Chidi you saw your soul mate or whatever, who had some entirely different life.
- They're not the same Chidis.
The theme's "Lord of the Rings.
" They're basically doomed.
We've got Hector over in American Coins, and my dear buddy, Matt, in Weird Sex Things.
I'm still waiting on a response to the request I filed for immediate suicide.
When people die, their biographical history and final point totals are sent to the relevant destination.
This batch is going to the Bad Place.
I don't want to see those memories because, philosophically speaking, they're none of my business.
They happened to someone else.
" That leads us to Derek Parfit.
- It does? - Parfit said even if I have memories from an earlier time, that doesn't necessarily mean it was me.
Hey, no peeking.
Accountants only.
They have been since the beginning.
"Og Gives His Rock to Grog.
[soft music] So, in essence, Hume thought that we don't truly have a self.
We're just a bundle of our ever-changing impressions.
- Jason, what is wrong with you? - Sorry, Janet.
I didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.
All right, why don't we look at No one.
No one got in.
And that was before I learned that I died and then un-died and then re-died.
I just can't take one more thing.
This seemed like the only option.
[high-pitched voice] Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor.
This is new.
I'm so annoyed at myself.
Not to brag.
I need you to hold it together.
Janet has a crush on you.
I'm sorry.
So, if there's nothing else "If there's nothing else"? Neil, be logical.
Not one Good Place resident in over 500 years? Not Jonas Salk? Not Harriet Tubman? Not one single Golden Girl? The Bad Place has hacked your system! No, it hasn't.
We keep wandering around these different realms expecting someone else to have the answer, but no one ever does.
You're the guy, Michael.
- I know.
What am I supposed to be doing right now? I don't remember.
You make fun of me a lot.
You once called me a human snooze button.
Uh-oh.
Ooh.
But there is some good news.
- There's some cake left.
Accountants only.
I need one of you to volunteer to do something outrageously insane that will either make you cease to exist or be really fun.
Come on.
Here you go.
We're in the Good Place.
Are we sure we're in the actual Good Place? It's rather carpeted.
The Good Place smells like whatever makes you happiest.
[sniffing] Warm pretzels.
I don't think we're in the main Good Place area.
This seems like this is some kind of a mail depot.
And you four won a contest.
- Really? - Really? Okay, not that.
We're coming from Accounting, and as we were climbing through the the mailbox, it it blew up.
The explosion was caused by demons.
I'm Michael, and this is my Neutral Janet.
Hello, also, not hello.
Make yourselves at home.
There's a sofa, that's a bowl of fruit, that's the door to the Good Place.
Chidi, help me.
- She said it's not gonna open.
And now all that stands between us and the actual Good Place is one door? What is that two inches thick? That's like four Oreos.
We're four Oreos from heaven.
Oh, sorry, you'd have to contact them directly, and that's definitely against the rules.
I see.
So, it's entirely untraceable? Sure is.
What a fun thought experiment.
[bright music] Jason, you seem thoughtful and that concerns me.
Do you remember that one time when we were in Janet's void, and we all looked like Janet? I do, yes.
When we were in there, I was wandering around, because you have the ability to make anything, and I wanted to see where you keep the roller blades.
And I accidentally saw that video thing about how you love me.
Be clear, be confident, and don't let them intimidate you.
Oh, wow.
Thank you for coming.
No, thank you for asking us to come.
Then get pluots, Kellen.
Get as many pluots as can fit in your tote bag.
Right now, we're together in heaven basically.
And we're in love.
Why not have our first date four Oreos away from paradise? You still wanna go out with me after I just showed you my anxiety sweats? Man, you must really be into me.
You have to admit, it's very odd that no one has gotten into the Good Place for 500 years.
While you wait, Kellen will stand by you, showering you with compliments.
Great job, Michael.
It's nice to be here.
And it's not nice to not be there.
- [groans] Jason knows that I love him, it stinks to hear about how the two of you are married, this beige outfit really washes out my not-skin, and if I don't remain neutral in front of Gwendolyn, she's gonna know we've been lying.
All of these new emotions I'm feeling are about to burst out of me, which might be super embarrassing.
You are, though.
I'm not worried about that anymore.
Is this a horny cry? No, I'm crying because I'm miserable, and it's all your fault.
Why? Do you not like the outfit? I love the outfit.
We are only giving ourselves 400 years to select the members of this elite team.
Wait, 400 years just to form the team? I was thinking that we could do something now-ish.
Just so you know, the whole time you're doing this, the bad guys are continuing to torture everyone who ends up in the Bad Place, which is everyone.
And that deeply concerns us.
I know it's not your main concern, but whatever part of you was vexed by our silly arrangement, you can now both relax.
I can tell by your silence and inability to make eye contact with me that I've knocked it out of the park.
So, you and I are married again? No, we we're not.
Um Bleh.
"It is the only time TOGETHER: "When we have any power.
" I know that quote.
What if we both write down what we think you mean What if we didn't? Ooh ah.
Michael? How did it go? Is the Committee going to help us? The Committee's a bunch of ineffectual dorks in fleece vests.
How do I just make them happy? How do you make Jason happy? You give him a lollipop shaped like a Transformer.
You'd think it'd be that simple.
[bleeping] In 1534, Douglass Wynegar of Hawkhurst, England, gave his grandmother roses for her birthday.
He picked them himself, walked them over to her, she was happy boom, 145 points.
We have a lot to do.
But we didn't really deal with my thing Okay, I'll just figure it out.
Did I say something wrong again? No, I'm just crying because you're such a nice and thoughtful friend.
And the emotions aren't coming out of my butt, they're coming out of my eyes, which is somehow just as embarrassing.
Michael, have you all been lying to me this whole time? That upsets me! I'm gonna try to shake my fist at you.
D'oh! Gosh darn it.
Sorry, did he just say we're going to IHOP? - Yes.
- Tight.
So you're telling me I can't get any pancakes at this IHOP? It's not the place you're thinking of.
This is the Inter-dimensional Hole of Pancakes.
Okay.
Now watch your step.
Permits must have been a headache.
It looks like we're inside a Diane Von Furstenburg pattern from spring 2013! Okay, everyone, just be cool.
Mm-hmm.
And if I don't double-die in this IHOP and the Judge lady doesn't turn you into a marble do you want to try being boyfriend-girlfriend? I'm not a girl.
That is a great look for you.
If things don't work out here with old Blondie, you know who to call this bitch.
Ah.
Ah.
- Wonderful.
- All right.
Those are the consequences.
You don't want the consequences? Do the research.
Well, we gave it our best shot, guys.
It was nice knowing you.
Amazingly, Your Honor, he's right.
I didn't really understand people until I went to Earth.
Duh.
[chuckles] - Whoa.
Where did you go, exactly? Tanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark.
It's terrible everywhere and always in a different way.
That's problem number one.
Life is chaotic and messy and unpredictable.
But that was also bad, and I still got sent to the Bad Place.
So I'm problem number three.
Shawn, I have reason to believe that humans might be, on average, better than the points system suggests they are.
Counterpoint humans are terrible Limp Bizkit, slavery.
Plus, you have zero proof they did get better.
You didn't keep track of their points.
Yeah, yeah, the Time-Knife.
We've all seen it.
The four of us becoming better people could be a fluke.
So let's repeat the experiment.
Where would you even put this Neighborhood? I wouldn't allow it to be built in the Good Place, that's for sure.
And I doubt you'd want to come back - to my neck of the woods.
And if you want to talk to someone, talk to Derek.
I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.
You have nothing to worry about.
"How should he love thee? "Or how deem thee wise Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering?" Oh.
Not to brag, but I almost have a full-grown penis now.
It's resplendent and mostly functional.
So here are the rules.
Michael designs the new Neighborhood however he wants.
So one last issue where do we get all the other residents for this place? Well, my original Neighborhood was built for torture, so everyone was a demon.
We can't have that.
They'll be way more advanced than the original Derek.
- No offense.
- I have some ideas for how to design a sort of basic Neighborhood, which we can then tailor to the guests as we learn more about them.
Now, when you say, um, some ideas - I have 11 trillion ideas.
And you're lame, and I hate you.
I love you, too.
I'll wait for your instructions.
Thank you for making me.
You know, if we pooled our resources, we could be done in two shakes of a lamb's Derek.
Whatever.
[chuckling] You fell for it.
It's me, Shawn.
First of all, that's stupid.
But also, we are switching it up.
- Oh, Michael.
It's going to be so amazing watching your four BFFs look so sad and betrayed and confused as you, their reformed demon-daddy, unleash a swarm of penis bees.
BOTH: Mm, bye, bitch! So how bad is contestant number one? Murderer? War criminal? Instagram DJ? Uh, yeah, um - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm.
Yep.
Wow, that's freaky.
So, based on initial skimming of his file, we will run scenario G48-119.
- Hey, listen whatever your plan is, it's gonna be great.
We trust you.
- Michael? - Oh, yeah, I'm gone.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's why I can't do it.
It's just too scary.
Is my tie getting tighter, or is my neck getting fatter somehow? Oh, this is what we do.
We tell the judge we have to cancel the experiment because I have a fat neck.
I'm Michael.
I'm the Architect.
You're here because of all the incredible things you did on Earth, which are all right in front of me, so let me just check your file.
Mmm, good.
Ooh, uh, why is it 322 people? Is that number significant somehow? Well Janet? - [SOFT BEEP] - Hi, there.
It's me, Eleanor, the Architect of the neighborhood.
Get over here now, dummy.
- I'm sorry.
I'm now the Architect.
And stop making those faces because I already told John, and there's no going back now.
Oh, I love you so much.
Okay, okay.
- [CHUCKLES] - Hey, how's it going? - This is overwhelming.
It's every thought and decision and action from this guy's entire life.
It's kinda like I'm secretly dating my boss not that I ever would have done that.
Yeah, no, me neither.
Tahani Al-Jamil.
Yes? Do I know you? Uh, no, no, but I know you.
I wouldn't call it mean, okay? My targets were rich and high status and I was just doing the important work of telling truth to power.
So, wait, what about you, huh? You died in Canada? [SHOUTS] That is so weird and embarrassing.
- Huh.
What are the odds that you and I would end up spending eternity together? [QUIRKY MUSIC] Eleanor, Michael, it is I, Tahani.
He chose your tormenters or arch rivals.
Or exes.
You must believe me.
And how are we gonna make Simone better when she's asleep the whole time? Hello? We can't work with this.
Have fun with your ex, Chidi.
What's that thing you humans say when you're playing chess and you trap your opponent into an inescapable position? Oh, right.
- I won't let you down.
Okay, go, guys.
Let's just take this step by step.
Step one, you leave so I can snap your amnesiac ex-girlfriend out of her post-death coma and welcome her into fake heaven.
That's exactly what the Bad Place wants me to do.
They sent John here to drag me back into my old patterns insecurity, obsession with social status.
Get out of here.
I never want to see you again.
- Ooh, those go great together.
- Mmm.
[MELLOW MUSIC] That went pretty well, right? I've always been good at pretending I've never met people before.
It's kinda my go-to power move.
It won't be okay, which is why you need to erase my memory and reboot me.
[TENSE MUSIC] What are you talking about? No forking way.
I used to run into my exes all the time at the mall, at the dentist office, when I drunk texted them and told them to come over.
Look, Simone is really perceptive.
You all spent a lot of time together, so his memories of you and her are all swirled together.
But let's keep thinking.
So, the plan is to erase Chidi's memory all the way back to when the air conditioner fell on his head in his original timeline.
The judge has given us until tomorrow morning before we have to bring in the other two subjects.
- But this is awful.
You two won't be together anymore.
We'll get Chinese food, and we'll throw pencils and stick them in the ceiling, and someone will say something innocuous and I'll say, "Wait.
Say that again.
And did I say that I hate this? Because I hate this.
You don't need to apologize for making a huge sacrifice to save your friends.
I'm gonna miss you so much, Eleanor.
Except you won't.
I wish we had more time together.
Oh, time means nothing.
- Janet? - [SOFT BEEP] - Hi, there.
- Hi, Janet.
Sure.
The more human I become, the less things make sense.
" A big, mean, bald guy with a goatee.
- I mean, he wasn't wrong.
I'm one out of three of those things, but thank you.
Good luck.
I've been great.
What about you?
Thank you very much.
How's it going?
I'm attending PCC right now.
Are you enjoying it there?
Everything's been good with you?
I haven't been better.
Thanks a lot.
It's an ugly day today.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot.
I know, you're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
It looks like it may rain soon.
Yes, and I hope that it does.
I really hope it rains today.
Yeah, me too.
Really?
Why?
The sky looks so clean after it rains.
I love it.
That sounds like fun.
What's the weather going to be like?
You're right.
One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
It sounds like it will be.
Predictable weather would make life easier.
It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.
Every day the weather seems different.
I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
I was cleaning up.
It's okay.
Hi, how are you.
Is Alice there?
What did you have in mind?
I was thinking about seeing a movie.
No problem.
Did you need something?
She's really pretty.
Describe her to me.
There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?
I haven't seen her yet.
Are you telling me that you've seen her before?
I believe so
She has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Do you want anything to make you feel better?
No, thanks.
I'm still feeling under the weather.
Would you like anything for your stomach?
I'm still feeling a little sick.
I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
You haven't told me anything yet.
I got a promotion at work earlier this week.
You deserved this promotion.
Is that what you really think?
I appreciate that.
You have no idea how happy I am for you.
It's really nice.
Thanks again. You look nice today, too.
You do?
I just bought this outfit a couple days ago.
Those are nice.
What are they?
What store did you get it from?
I went to Macy's and picked it out.
They only cost me about forty dollars.
I'm going to go get a pair for myself.
I see that you're pretty talented.
Thank you very much.
I first learned how to do it in high school.
Did you take some sort of art class or something?
Oh, you actually do that?
Every so often, I do.
They just need to find it.
What's your favorite movie?
I did.
Me too.
Honestly, it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
You're right. That movie is hilarious.
I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever.
You think so, how come?
I would love to.
What type of music do you like to listen to?
I enjoy listening to all kinds of music.
What kind?
I enjoy listening to both Rock and R&B.
What interests you in that type of music?
Our school did.
They played really well.
I'll make sure and make it to the next one.
Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game?
It was a great game.
What was the score at the end of the game?
Our team played hard and won.
I really wish I went to the game.
I'm going to the movies with a friend.
How about you?
Okay, sounds good.
Do you know what you're going to do this weekend?
Thank you for inviting me, but I think I'll pass.
All right. Another time then.
No good movies come to mind.
Have you decided whether or not you would like to go?
That would be nice, thank you.
No problem, you're welcome.
It's no trouble at all.
If you get sick, I'll return the favor.
Don't mention it.
When you miss a day of school, I'll be happy to give you the English assignments.
Well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
Oh my God, that's great!
I didn't know that.
I thought you knew.
I haven't heard anything.
Debrah had her baby last week.
I appreciate that.
Did you go to school today?
I really want to go to the movies this weekend.
So go then.
Maybe it was, but answer the question.
No, not recently.
That's nice, have you been to the movies lately?
No, but that was a random change of subject.
It's no problem. I was really missing you anyway.
I missed you too.
I am too.
I'm really glad that you came to see me.
Tell me what you've been doing.
Basically, I've been working too.
I've really been working a lot lately.
I've been pretty busy myself.
Well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today.
Yeah, so are you planning on going?
Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday?
I've heard about it, but I'm still waiting for my invitation.
It's supposed to start at about eight.
How many invitations has she given out?
Are you even going to go?
Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year.
I'm throwing a party on Friday.
I didn't realize that.
What's going on with you?
Fine. What's going on with you?
I hope that I'll see you there.
No doubt
What time does it start?
The party starts at 8.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Why not?
Oh, really?
You are coming?
Not a lot, what about you?
I'm having a party next Saturday.
I'm sorry.
What's up?
I'm going to dinner with my family.
I really wanted you to come, but I understand.
Do you think you can come?
I'm sorry.
Nothing really. How about you?
A lot, like the party I'm having on Friday.
I'll be there.
It was nice talking to you.
That's harsh.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
That's not nice.
I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now.
I'm not being nosey, it's just a question.
You don't need to worry about that.
I think we should go out to eat.
That sounds good.
I think that would be nice.
Is there anything you would like to do next time?
It was really nice talking to you also.
I think we should really do something sometime.
See you.
I'd like to reserve a hotel room.
Is that okay with you, Mr. Sandals?
How much per night are we talking about?
Your reservation is in our computer.
All we need now is a phone number.
Hi, Mr. Sandals.
I'm Michelle, at your service.
Great!
Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
It's area code 626-555-1739.
Thank you so much, Mr. Sandals.
I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th.
Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates.
Nonsmoking.
That'll be nonsmoking.
I need a hotel room.
That's no problem at all.
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision.
It'll be $308 nightly.
That would be 626-555-1739.
That's 626-555-1739.
Do you mind, sir?
Possibly. What's the actual price?
It's 626-555-1739.
Let me repeat that: 626-555-1739. Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you in April!
Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay.
Only $308 per night, before taxes, of course.
Now if you'll just give me your phone number.
Not a problem.
Thank you.
Do you have a credit card, Mr. Sandals?
Here's your key, sir.
If you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.
I'm sorry, sir.
Only VISA or MasterCard.
May I see your identification, please, sir?
Here you are.
Does that meet your expectations?
Yes, that sounds like what I want.
Would you like my American Express card?
Regrettably, Mr. Sandals, we accept only MasterCard or VISA.
Just dial 0 if you need anything.
My name is John Sandals, and I've got a reservation.
Thank you, sir. You'll be in room 507, nonsmoking, with a queen-size bed.
Do you approve, sir?
Yes, I do.
Do you accept American Express?
What time do you want the call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
Good night, sir.
I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning.
Not at the moment, thank you.
Let me know if you do need anything.
Will there be anything else?
No, that gets it for now, thank you.
Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?
No sooner said than done.
Then again, I think 7:15 is too early.
Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.
Your wish is our command.
Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15.
Berkowitz will be here in a minute, okay? Hey, uh, what's that picture? Is that Halloween? Oh, no.
I think this was closer to Christmas.
Anything else? Well, I was just gonna ask you, is your husband also a badass soldier? Oh, yeah, he was.
- [gasps] Oh, my God, I'm sorry! - [laughs] Oh No, he he was a badass soldier, but now he does private security in Afghanistan.
Papito, let's go! You know I got a bum shoulder.
I need help over here.
Sounds like you're both on the same page.
Your daughter does not want to have a quinces.
She has to have a quinces.
How else will we know the day that our little girl becomes a woman? You missed it.
I'm not doing it.
You need to do something about this little sinvergÃ¼enza.
[chuckles] Oh, well I can't have my son walking around in Monday sneakers on a Saturday.
Somebody might call child services.
You have a laptop.
These are things that poor people have.
You guys already ate, didn't you? She made ropa vieja.
I'm not made of stone.
So, there is some ropa vieja in the mantequilla thing if you don't want to eat that sad meat.
I bought it, I'm eating it.
[bangs table] I agree.
So let's talk quinces.
Oh! [speaking Spanish] [banging] [banging stops] [coughs] [Lydia in English] You're welcome! [knocking on door] Schneider! Well, you grew out that mustache, huh? Yeah, I finally took the plunge and went full handlebar.
Feelin' really good about it.
- Uh, careful.
That's very expensive Damascus steel.
I can get that done by tonight.
Maybe after dinner.
- Hmm.
Wonder how they got there.
Oh! Hello, Schneider.
Hola, seÃ±ora.
Mommy, please, put those away.
I hate those pictures.
You know, keep it hundred.
You down? What's happening right now? Schneider, she's gonna do it.
So, what's so bad about this modern village coming together to celebrate you? - Oh, yeah! She's good.
- Oh.
Elena, you wrecked your first communion because, as a vegetarian, you wouldn't eat the body of Christ.
You even refused to take any pictures with Santa because your abuelita wouldn't admit that Christmas is a pagan ritual.
Oh, God, just accept it.
You're Cuban, you're 15, you're gonna have a big party, with a poofy dress and a bad photo.
What's going on with you today? You're you're all on edge.
I had to put my foot down with Elena about her quinces, and I'm not sure if I did the right thing.
Did you ever take those No, no.
I threw them right in the trash.
At least I'm safe for another year with the little one.
[cell phone chimes] - Oh! Your phone telling you things.
Alex.
Alex! He can't hear you! - [door closes] - He is possessed by the YouTube.
As long as I keep them clean, I can send them right back.
I know you wanna be mad, but that's genius.
Exactly! It's like I'm stealing.
No, you're not charming your way out of this.
Don't you have more money now that Papi's gone? [scoffs] What? Well, you have a job, plus Papi gives you money, right? So that's, like, double money.
Sit down.
At least you're talking to me now.
It says you got a D.
Yes, you keep that up, and you will not have a quinces.
Wait I can't believe you.
Wait, what what is that? It's an anti-depressant that I'm gonna be taking.
- [gasps] - So just deal with it.
He's being a good provider.
There are jobs here where they don't shoot at you.
" A partner.
[voice breaking] Someone to love.
I got you.
[sighs] [Penelope] Hey.
You just be a twelve-year-old boy, okay? Okay.
And you're right, I shouldn't worry too much about what's going on down here, when I got so much going on up here.
Yeah, and this is not because of that crap you pulled with the test.
You do that again and I'll put my quinces tiara on you while you sleep, and post it to your Instagram.
" My point is we've made progress.
I didn't know you were such a feminist, Mom.
" I know.
It was dumb.
We're gonna show them what single mothers can pull off.
I will dress like a child bride for you, Mom.
Not today.
[exhales heavily] Move over.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You were just having a nightmare.
Ay, Mami, don't say that.
No, mija, if I do die, and I'm not saying I will make sure that they do a good job on my face for the funeral and bring a little red lipstick along.
And the last four were to piss you off.
So you're basically murdering the planet just to spite me.
Mija, why are you in your uniform before you shower and get ready? I am ready, Abuelita.
That's what I was afraid of.
- Oh, yes, he is a clown.
And like every other clown, I want to punch him in the face.
You have weird goals.
Hey! No, she doesn't.
We're all here.
There's four of us.
Here's some information I think you'll all find interesting, dare I say, badass.
Lately, we've been getting some complaints from patients about wait times.
Right, Berkules? I like that, yeah.
And I must say, I'm very attracted to the concept of nothing changing.
Ooh, is she cubana? Close, she's from Sacramento.
We're going out dancing tonight, and I may have led her to believe that I know how to salsa dance.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
- Wow, that is so inspiring.
- Mmm.
Okay, there goes my shoulder.
Whatever, I needed that.
In five seconds, I go from nodding thoughtfully to lighting a car on fire.
You lit a car on fire? That happened only once, okay? And it was kind of an accident.
But you wanna know how I dealt with that bobo? By being a better soldier than him.
And eventually, that's how they saw me, not as a woman at all.
Okay, everybody stop gesturing.
Mom, I'm not talking about old people sexism.
The sexism I'm talking about is all the little disrespectful things that men do that That they don't even realize.
Sorry, I cut you off.
You gotta call Scott out.
Why would I waste my time? That is right.
Man, I'm glad I'm a guy, so I don't have to think about sexism.
Mi amor, wake up.
Even in those you had your ears pierced.
Oh, without earrings I look ridiculous.
Just, if you get hit with a hamburger today, it's gonna stick.
Oh, come on, Elena, it looks nice.
- Ay, Mami, no.
Damn it, you're right.
Blue Sky, what if we stagger the appointments by just five minutes? People would wait less, and be so much happier when they see your handsome mug.
Smart way to go! - Boom.
Oh.
When it comes to ideas, no one's keeping score, but today, Scott wins! Oh, all right, I need to say something.
It's the way you act.
You dismiss everything I say! Oh.
B's cool as a cuke.
I'm about to cry.
We all make the same $30 an hour.
Thirty dollars an hour? He makes more than me? You know what? I think I'll get my pen.
Your accent is still no good.
But my salsa moves are, thanks to you.
My friends were calling her names like cute and pretty.
I'm the pretty one in this family.
- Oh! You're welcome, mija.
So, tomorrow, we try the makeup again? No, Abuelita, I tried it and I didn't like it.
I like the way I am, even if you don't.
Elena Mami, I did something terrible.
Oh, so you quit because of principles.
Are you crazy? I know, I know.
I'm beggin' you.
I can't run the office without you.
That mystery's solved.
To be honest, I don't know if it's a woman thing or what.
And you deserve more.
How about this? How about this? What if I give you a raise, and you make the same amount as Scott? - Plus a dollar more an hour.
Well, he's got that jock thing going on.
I think that's what seduced me.
We're not doing this again.
No, no.
Then I understand, and I will never bother you about that again.
Except for your quinces.
- [both] Morning.
Ah.
Oh.
Oh, what's that, Papa? Are you lonely? You wanna be with your friends? Well [speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] [in English] He looks happy there.
Do orphans always have rich dads who buy them buildings? Hey, I may have money in the bank and two living parents, and four living stepmothers but there is a hole in here.
We never had family meals.
Which one was that? Oh, no.
Rosa was my nanny.
Hi.
[sighs] Ah.
[chuckles] So, there is the floor and slip.
[laughing] [Schneider laughs] Oh, that Dylan.
Yeah, and Abuelita and I have tickets to wrestling.
I don't understand why you waste good money on that.
Mami, it's okay if we miss it one time.
It's not gonna kill us.
Sundays we go to church And then, sometimes we go to Applebee's.
Well, I have a foot, too, and I'm gonna put my foot down and say this Sunday we're not going to church.
- [Elena] Really? When you take the communion you believe you're eating the actual flesh and blood of Jesus? Ay, no, it's a symbol.
Don't be gross.
No, we are not! I work hard all week.
When I get home, there's barely enough time to have a meal with the kids.
Okay, I'd choose Lydia because of her warm food and even warmer hugs.
But I'd feel really bad about it.
Oh, come on.
Es una cosita.
Ay, exactly.
- Thank you for understanding - No! So I am a servant? Like Cinderella? No, Cinderbuela.
She said my cuffs looked shabby.
Who am I to disagree? All right, Mami, you win! Where are Alex's pants? [Latin music continues playing] Where's Abuelita? She's small.
But I want you to know, nothing happened.
What were you thinking, chasin' that woman away? She's funny, she's charming, and when she gets angry, she cleans.
And I'm sorry for that, too.
And that.
Any word from your mom? No, but I'm sure she's home talking crap about me with Juan Pablo and Benedicto.
Has she ever disappeared like this before? No, usually when we fight, she does the opposite of go away.
That must look amazing.
- Okay, I'm not explaining this right.
Carmen, Elena's best friend? We have got to catch you up.
I know who Carmen is.
Anyway [sighs] I appreciate you helping me out.
Ah, it's cool.
And plus, she's 70.
One wrong move and she's down.
Still you shouldn't stereotype.
- Hi, Birdie.
I think it's free.
[laughing] Oh, I think that car was for Stick Girl.
I just I need you to give me more space to parent.
I understand what you are saying.
Well, it's not that hard.
You need a sharp knife, that's all.
Without you, we'd be on the street living in a cardboard box.
[sighs] You're just saying that to cheer me up.
What? She said she didn't want to go to church.
- [dinging] - Mami! Don't do that! Mami, por favor, vÃ¡monos ya, - please! - You go on.
[stuttering] Um, church.
Uh, whoa! What do we have here? Oh, nothing special, just some nutted quinoa, wilted broccolini with radish micro-greens, and venison carpaccio on a bed of nettles.
I'm sorry things got crazy the other night.
That's that's not us.
Who threw up on the table? What were you doing all day? Oh, you know, saying my Rosary, praying for the departed souls Asking forgiveness for your mother.
- Mami.
I don't wanna go to hell.
There is no hell.
He tries so hard.
Look, Mami, I get it.
And I am so glad that that gives you comfort.
But that doesn't mean that God exists, okay? I'm sorry.
- PerdÃ³n.
Lo siento.
I wear it because you gave it to me.
I don't understand the difference, so please just let me have this.
" [exhales] And, Mami, I am glad that you find comfort in church.
I just find it in different places.
Yes.
Exactly.
 Uh This is my third coat, Jerry.
What do we think? Over the top, or just Cuban? Lady, you look great.
No pressure.
No pressure, Jerry? Mira, a first date is two hearts parched in the desert, quenching forever their thirst for amor.
And I was about to enter the heart of the hurricane.
And I'm circling the block.
I know, Jerry! Thanks, Mami.
Claro, but I have to go.
You have a good night.
-And I'mma give you five stars.
That's a good Oh, you're serious? Well, what about you, Penelope? Oh, you know, Mama got a big pile of bills with her name on it.
No, literally my name is on every bill.
Sometimes when I wanna splurge, I get the Betty Crocker omelet for two, for one.
Doc, you're forgetting about the best part about being single.
Okay, okay! Everybody, I really appreciate all the advice but I'm good.
I don't need a date.
-That's my name.
I'll remember now.
Berkowitz is my boss, remember, Michelle? I'm about to have my first date in 20 years, and right now you're my therapist, so I need you to keep up.
-Can I get a beer? -No, she's busy.
A white girl like yourself's gotta start worrying around 30.
-How old are you? -Thirty-three.
Maybe I've melted.
Michelle! Am I just a puddle, a carrot, and a magic hat? -Oh, no, I can't.
- All right, all right.
Are you sure you wanna do the online thing? For you, I'd recommend a more old-fashioned approach.
Yes, it's been 20 years.
You know, back then, online dating meant hooking up while waiting in line to buy Boyz II Men tickets.
If you're good, a never reveal.
Right, right, lie about everything.
And anyone who says they're an entrepreneur.
What does your profile say? I am an entrepreneur.
He's probably already forgotten about your date and moved on to someone whose bicycle isn't wearing sneakers.
I'm really bad at Photoshop.
-All right.
-Look at me in the eye here.
And I am here.
Oh, man.
All right, come on, Abby.
Open up.
And now, I'm gonna say to you what I wish my mother would have said to me before my date.
Good luck.
I'm just having dinner, okay? And I'm not being a puta.
No, you're a married woman, who is going out on a date with a man who is not your husband.
But you're you're really okay? Of course.
I mean, it's well-documented that women in their late 30s are in their sexual prime.
We're we're just thinking.
Mmm.
Then he has to invite Jade because he invited Joaquin.
Then she wants to bring JuJu and Casey and Maddie.
So, does Papi think I'm a puta, too? Ay, no seas ridÃ­cula, your papi would never say those things about you.
Only I think that.
Now I'm here.
Your waiter will be with you in a minute.
Have you seen her, by the way? Please tell me she's eating something.
The point is, everybody had an opinion about this.
But, uh, wasn't two hearts in the desert like you and Papi.
Aw! Yeah, I'm not gonna see him again.
Anyway, stupid Finn pushed me into a bush and I got scratched.
Why do you like that kid again? Because he seems like a-- Like a dick? Yes, but that's not okay that you said that.
Then what did you want? A crappy chick flick by myself.
And a fro-yo with three too many toppings.
I know! I know Why do you know? My dumb friends have been trying to get me and this girl, Anna, together.
Oh, I see.
Oh, God, what is it? Did you steal something? Did you damage something? Did you pee on something 'cause you were mad and then later you were, like, "I shouldn't have done that"? No! Who does that? These are just general examples.
What did you do? This isn't because Finn pushed me into a bush.
I am a Latina, you are a 12-year-old boy, so we have the same amount of facial fuzz.
Okay.
-Â¿QuÃ©? -Mmm-hmm.
-You told me she was going.
Â¿QuÃ© puedo hacer? Bertito they broke the mold when they made you.
Now you're just being nice.
Alvarez.
We were working really hard on our immigration project for school, so we took a little power nap.
[Lydia] It's okay.
Schneider is staying, too.
Yeah, but no, no, no.
I think there's something a little bit, uh, queer.
I got it all planned out.
Apparently, last year, he ended up at Medieval Times by himself.
And, Mom, I guess at work, or wherever you go? Deadline is Friday.
Most sales gets a PlayStation.
Come on.
Work up a good sales pitch.
[sighs] Hey, guys.
I fixed the water pressure and tested it.
- But you are late! - But I didn't want to be.
You know what's weird? The bakery where you told me to pick up the cake? [laughing] I was there getting coffee this morning.
"Y birthday"? Well said, banner.
Well said.
My husband has couples counseling with the dog, so I'm free.
I got kicked off Tinder, so so am I.
Give me a status report.
Rice is on the stove, costillas in the marinade, and I look fantastic! Schneider! Where's that centerpiece you promised me? The gourd is drying, as is the glitter.
- I made my sangria.
- Two pitchers? Last time I drank that, I woke up naked in the tub with a French braid.
[chuckles] You're not as funny as your mom.
Guys, guys, oh, my I'm sorry.
Can she only survive in this apartment's atmosphere? - You guys can take the night off.
- No! You better watch that attitude.
The trouble's arriving in ten minutes.
I'm sparing you, trust me.
- You know what? Just put it down.
- [grunts] Okay.
That's great.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Alex! Hi, I'm Alex Alvarez.
Youth sports is one of the most important activities Okay, okay, okay.
[all laughing] I don't know if it's the sangria, but I am havin' a great time.
- [chuckles] It's the sangria.
Hi, I'm Alex Alvarez.
Youth sports is one of the most important activities in building character I'll buy five.
Happy birthday to you [laughs] [all singing] Happy birthday to No, no.
Just me.
- [blows] - Bravo! [all cheering] All right.
Is it over? Can I go to my room now? Please, Elena, lighten up.
Why was Carmen trying to come in through the window? Yeah, that was a little, uh Queer? You come here.
Is is everything all right? Yeah, everything is great.
Uh, that'd be weird.
He sounds just like my kids.
- [exhales] - What's happening? I immigrated here illegally.
I'm a Canadian.
I sense a liter of sarcasm.
Anyway, it's fine now.
Who wrote that? Just because I wrote it, doesn't mean it wasn't true.
I bet you were fabulous.
There was no RSVP.
[all laughing] Oh, that's great.
You got mad at me.
Because it was in the workplace.
m.
, but now you gotta pay a cover.
There are persecuted people all around the world who would love the opportunity to come here, but they can't.
Because the rules are different for different people.
[sighs] All right, stay here.
Hey, everyone.
Lori threw up, but the good news is she made it to the hall, so it's a Schneider problem.
[sighs] What do I do? Do I drive you somewhere? Is there a detention center? Pero, uh, quÃ© pasÃ³? My dad got sick, and they heard about this doctor that helps undocumented people.
Especially if it's not great.
We take care of people.
That's why I did the laundry and reorganized the pantry.
Oh, was that you? [gasps] Alphabetical order.
My parents didn't do anything wrong.
They both work two jobs.
No Mom! Texas? The worst place on the planet? - He lives in Austin.
- Austin! Actually, I hear Austin's pretty chill.
It got me through war, and I'm pretty sure it'll get you through Austin.
Inside are some shirts and jeans, and I'm guessing you might be interested in my old combat boots.
" And then my mami said, "Keep it together for your papi.
" So be a good friend, mmm? Think how difficult this must be for her.
Thanks, Alex.
Thank you, seÃ±ora.
Unless we're going downhill, and then she might not stop.
We are so late.
Resnick's traded her in for a younger model.
That's not funny, papito.
Because then they don't go back up.
And it's only a crime to leave children in a hot car if it's parked.
Well it'll probably be 20 minutes before a tow-truck gets here.
So, what should we do to pass the time? Oh, I know.
Can you feel it working? Hey, guys.
Oh! And we are 29 again.
Now the whole team calls me "Butt-trunk boy.
" They could've called me "Junk in the trunk," it was right there.
Uh-huh? Oh, you saved the cassingle! It unspooled.
That's okay, Hector, no.
We drove Mrs.
Resnick up the coast and at sunset, your papi bet me $5 that he'd marry me.
She taught me how to salsa.
She was amazing.
His beloved little daughter on one side and on the other, his beloved bottle of rum.
That sounds dangerous.
" I am a badass! But I'm also kind of a scaredy cat, you know, because I never bought a car before, you know? That salesman is gonna see me coming a mile away.
Then he's gonna do that thing where he talks to the guy.
- So you are for the car now? - No! But as a crusade, yes.
Annoying.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I hate car dealerships.
It's the end of the month and it's the best time to negotiate.
I'm sorry, I'm seeing my daughter for the first time in ages, and she's bringing her therapist, and lawyer and life coach.
Come on, abuelita, I saw beautiful parts of the city, I talked to fascinating people, and I pushed myself outside my comfort zone.
When's the last time you did that? When I moved here as a 15-year-old girl without my family and not speaking the language.
You should've seen Schneider.
The other parents were obsessed.
I was gonna say husband.
Oh! A May-December thing.
You're comin' on way too strong.
No, I gotta be tough.
Hey! I earned this guilt.
But, yeah, I kinda feel sorry for the salesman.
It was a difficult time, but I'm proud to serve my country.
- I hear what you're saying.
She's more badass than I am.
Yeah, I got bigger fish here, Penelope.
It's just that my real husband and I are actually separated and this is my first big purchase without him.
I get it.
Well, Vernon's library is much better than ours.
My bus driver actually tipped me off.
They left my shoes! Mi vida, it's not that bad.
Just yesterday, I took the bus to the farmer's market and then I went to collect on some bottles that I had saved.
Abuelita, it's just the wording is kind of provocative.
As is the photo! Don't be ridÃ­cula.
I have kids.
So I totally fudgin' get that.
Resnick.
I'm gonna miss you, old lady.
My son was probably conceived in the front seat or the back seat or both.
Well, let's just say it was the back.
He used to make people laugh.
And after that, I can't even remember seeing him smile.
I'm sorry to bring it up.
No, I can talk about it now, because I did get help.
'Cause Mrs.
Resnick kind of smells like a gas leak in Hawaii.
And you can stop milking the shoulder injury.
I already sold you the car.
" But I think we should totally get mani-pedis.
Mmm-hmm.
There's no one in here.
I just Then use your phone and Chapsmat somebody.
Okay, but Elena has to pick an escort by today! Or we will not have enough time to prepare.
But I wanna go to the street fair and my quinces is two months away! [mockingly] Jajaja.
[sighs] Just take the yearbook and pick somebody.
[sighs] Fine! This should be fun! Pick whoever you want.
Anyway, I can't go.
Today's the day I finally get through to Jolene.
Oh, thanks.
I got it on sale.
How was baseball? Terrible! I mean, they played great.
But my snack game was way off! The kids barely touched my black olive tapenade.
Here, take one of your pain pills.
I thought you don't want me to take "las drogas"? The pain in your body is real.
The blast caused a pallet of surgical gloves to fall on my shoulder.
The last part is not as impressive.
We can watch the other kids have a good time.
That sounds great.
All right.
Maybe this will entice you.
But this gig is really important to me.
These guys were like family.
Hello? Hello? [whimpering] Hello? No! Come on.
[muffled screaming] [hold music playing] Aw! [music stops] [woman on recording] Did you know that over 40% of trips to the emergency room are caused by preventable accidents? That seems high.
What are you doing here, Doc? Why aren't you at work? What? Who, me? Well you know, I always love a good street fair.
And and since you took a half day off of work, I thought maybe I should, too.
Tool kit.
Man's tool kit.
Daily.
So, um Thanks for inviting me to the fair.
It's time to take my pills.
Actually, I'm glad you reminded me.
Not the kind that steals music.
Although you can record the show for free.
- Who are you holding for? - Jolene.
I'm holding for Jolene.
That's okay.
I have to pee, but I'm gonna hold it.
But after I hang up and leave, it'll be empty again.
I just want an appointment with a chiropractor.
I sent a copy of it to Jolene's office, like, two months ago.
You should probably talk to Jolene, then.
- Okay.
I need you to watch the phone while I run out.
Maybe we should just hang out and play video games? [scoffs] Come on, your mom won't even notice.
I heard Shane Lennon sold one of his dad's pills for 20 bucks.
No, you shut up.
- [exhales heavily] - [pills rattle] [door opens] [hold music playing] [woman on recording] Having trouble communicating with your family members? [scoffs] You could say that.
I'm not even gonna ask about the sword.
What are you doing with Mom's pills? - I can explain.
I won't, but what's Finn's problem anyway? You're gonna let him turn you into a little Latino drug dealer? Stereotype much? It's not drug dealing.
God.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's not like you'd be in trouble.
That kebab line is no joke.
- [woman on phone] Hello? - Hello, hello? Who is this? This is Jolene in Pain Management.
Can I help you? Yes, ma'am.
Oh! I'm so excited.
- Why can't you help me now? - I have to go.
Okay.
What I do understand is I went to war, I got hurt.
And when I came back, there was supposed be an organization set up to help me and other veterans get the help we need.
- Hold, please.
- [scoffs] - [hold music playing] - [sighing] [music stops] [Jolene] I have set a chiropractor appointment for Alvarez, Penelope, 2294, next Monday at 11:00 a.
All right.
[Schneider over PA] Ahoy, Echo Parrrk! We be Full Sail! [Elena] Boo! [Schneider] Come on, Elena! [Schneider singing out of tune] It's not in the way that you hold me It's not in the way you say you care It's not in the way you look Or the things that you say that you do Hold the line Oh! Love isn't always on time [music continues playing]
m.
Usually by now, your sweatpants are on and your bra is off.
He will never replace your papi.
No, he's not Cuban.
Ay, quÃ© bueno.
Finally, you are going to pick a boy to be your quinces escort.
I am an amazing liar.
And you'd rather let them think all that date stuff, instead of just telling them you're goin' to therapy? Oh, yeah! If they had guessed I was a serial killer, I would have gone with that, too.
I mean, I'm a gay female minority, so anxiety and depression are my two best friends.
And isolation is my boo.
Come on, girl.
Get in there.
I'm Cuban! You know, we don't really do therapy.
I feel you.
" Anyway, it's totally fine if you don't feel And try being the only person in the history of your family that's getting a divorce.
Anybody here divorced? Oh, it's about to get shared.
Lydia can I ask you something? I am 73.
I know, I look 32.
Well, thank you so much for joining me.
I always get two tickets to stuff in hopes that someone will go.
What's so great about Buffy? It's just a vampire show.
Well, it's an allegory for how strong women are in constant battle with an oppressive, bloodsucking, male-dominated society.
Do I have to come to your quinces? - Who's the guy? - Josh Flores.
Josh Flores? He's like the star of the baseball team.
It's a metaphor, Alex.
Broccoli means boys.
What're you doing? I told Josh to come over.
What? Josh Flores is coming over? But I haven't showered.
So, I've been a civilian for ten years and I still get anxious when I'm shopping for clothes.
I feel that.
Oh, it's okay, Alvarez, the rest of us will talk next week.
It just feels so good to let it all out with you ladies.
I just wanna make sure you're okay because I care about you.
Okay.
Any hospital visits? No.
Oh! Oh, a long time ago, I had a stroke, but it was nothing.
Well, I I was cooking.
I had no time.
Mmm-hmm.
Ah, uh I said no hanky-panky.
Leave it.
Now that I have the foot of a monster, I want to hide in the shadows until it is fixed.
Aw Did you say you were watching Buffy? - Yeah, you know it? - Yeah, I love it.
First three seasons, solid.
Wait, do I like you? Do you always say your thoughts out loud? Because I kinda like it.
- I wanna kiss you now.
Ah Yeah, let's shut that for now.
Um, why do you need info on lesbians? Don't get me wrong.
Alex, are you saying Elena might be gay? Uh no.
Because it's a secret.
Elena will kill me.
Okay, don't worry.
Oh, wait, it's me! I should do something.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
'Sup? Okay, Elena, I'm sorry.
But, dude, I don't think you're supposed to be here without a parent around.
He was just confused 'cause you were suddenly into a boy.
Why would that be confusing? Uh Now I'm confused.
I love church.
Lydia, you should probably get something for your stomach.
Wait.
Who's a sex fiend? Elena.
You were at a Catholic mass, Dr.
Berkowitz? What can I say? I hedge my bets.
I mean, she should be so lucky.
We were just at therapy.
You had a stroke? I kept it a secret from you.
You kept it a secret from me? It was nothing.
Well, you went to therapy and said it was a date.
I can't believe you lied.
And you When you have a stroke and don't die, you tell people.
First thing Monday, I'm taking you to get a full physical.
Okay.
So this is why I lied.
Is there anything else anybody wants to tell me? Speak now.
All right.
But that's it.
And how was it? It was okay.
I mean, he likes Buffy and he has nice eyes.
But if I'm being honest, I think Alex is more into him than me.
[all gasp] I know.
It's not a perfect match.
He banned music.
He personally oversaw execution squads.
We know that sometimes you are a bobo and don't know what you're doing.
It's okay.
So, not the brave military mom wounded in the line of duty? Okay.
Let me guess.
Ay.
Â¡AzÃºcar!" You have captured my essence.
That's my boy.
[yells] Remember me? Can I finally share my news? I'm sorry, mama.
[whooping] But wait How much does it cost? All expenses paid.
[whooping] That's what I'm talking about! I mean, they say it's an Ivy League stepping stone.
Because that means you're killing it.
Because that means I'm killing it! - But I'm not even in yet.
It's pretty huge.
- She wants to be a journalist.
I had my own street luge.
You probably can't tell this by looking at me, but I was a big luger! Oh, we can tell.
Just like my parents did for me.
I know that's supposed to sound sweet, but it really bums me out.
I know nothing about my grandparents and I never will.
And they live in Pasadena! I mean, the traffic's just [sighs] Anyway, this is a huge opportunity for you.
'Cause dawn was pushing it.
Okay.
- "Dear, Ms.
Alvarez" - [both shrieking] Every year, thousands of students apply nationwide to fill 30 prestigious spots.
'Cause when you're my age, you might regret having missed your chance.
I want a spot, not a diversity spot.
Doc, there's, like, 20 patients waiting outside.
[mumbles] Just tell me which one you like better.
So, I've been thinking.
Theoretically, if I still wanted to become a doctor Yes, yes, yes! Okay! [chuckles] Now I'm excited! Break it down.
You may get Honolulu.
I got Toledo.
You are going to ace the math portion of the MCAT.
And don't you worry, you will be shocked at how quickly a decade goes by.
Lights, camera Talk now! [in exaggerated Cuban accent] I am a farmer.
I grow [grunts] coffee beans one of Cuba's most important exports.
Great.
But I have some notes on the script.
We'll talk about this later.
There's nothing left to talk about.
Elena! Oh, how do you storm off in this thing? [grunts] I have never seen such un-professionalism.
This is why I don't work! It's okay.
Make me laugh.
Make me cry.
Okay so you were put on a plane to a new country where you didn't know the language? Oh, yes.
Without your parents? Yes.
I think I am done talking.
Hmm? You want me to do her part? Is Alex okay? - Did I ruin his movie? - No.
Okay, forget therapy.
But you came here alone, with nothing and you made an amazing life.
Mami, you don't have a sister named Blanca.
There's Mimi, Maruchi, Mirtha.
" So I did it.
Because I did everything Blanca told me to do.
It's okay.
I'm glad I told you.
Oh, no.
I'm going to make sure that they don't forget that I'm Cuban.
[Lydia on TV] But every sacrifice was worth it, so that my family could be whatever they wanted to be, and do whatever they wanted to do.
[in exaggerated Cuban accent] IncreÃ­ble! But that is only one story.
That was great, Alex.
Thanks.
[chuckles] Relax, Doc.
You didn't inspire me.
I enjoy the white coat too much.
[laughs] NPs get a white coat.
Just substitute wine with whiskey, and coupons with more whiskey.
- Did you want something? - Just to share some amazing news.
Oh, you can just do everything else silently.
Whoa! - Schneider, you came here to watch porn? - No! Why won't it stop? No, I don't wanna chat with you! What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, come on, Pen.
My sweet boy is becoming a gross man! But, hey, silver lining, it's normal porn.
A threesome is not normal.
What kinda sex talk did your parents give you? Because I wanna do the opposite of that.
Well, Father believed it's best to have this kinda discussion in a car because you don't have to make eye contact.
I got a cousin named Paco, but he's an idiot.
Ay, it's not fair that I'm stuck giving both sex talks.
Then, Elena said "Cool! What's an exclamation point?" Lucky she didn't ask about a colon.
Sorry, it's just fun to hear about how you blew it.
Spoilers.
Sorry, it's just that her death scene was so Aw.
I feel compelled to tell you that this is not my computer.
No, it's Alex's.
I'm curious.
I wanna see how that movie ends.
That's the thing.
It used to be hard to get.
Show me.
Yeah, that's not happening.
Why is everyone staring at me? Is there a bug on me? Is there a bug on me? No, papito, you are bug-free and perfect as always.
Yeah.
We need to talk about something.
I am going to leave.
When is this going to be over? I get it.
This is uncomfortable for me, too.
I'm not lying.
I'm not stupid.
- Abuelita? - No! Hey, guys! I'm exhausted.
Good night.
Yeah.
There's not enough hours in a day to watch it all.
She just started kinda seeing this boy named Josh, but all they've done is kissed.
Aw, you're adorable.
"Technically" pure.
I guess we'll all spend the rest of the day thinking of ways to look Lori in the eye.
She is a porno.
I think I know what you're saying, and it's not fair 'cause when you thought it was Alex, you said it was healthy.
Straight to voicemail.
Elena, I really need to talk to you, so call me as soon as you get this.
Then people pair off.
And the next thing you know, Carlos PiÃ±ero's trying to unhook your bra on your best friend's parents' bed.
She's a good Catholic girl.
Oh, my God! What is this? There's no party.
What is this, bamboo? - Penelope, would you like to come in? - Yeah, sure.
You know, let me just unwedge myself from your doggy door before I embarrass myself.
We were watching a movie.
- Would you like to join us? - No.
Yeah.
Oh, just so you know, some maniac drove over your mailbox.
- You're back early.
- Yeah.
I know you've been looking at pornography.
Oh, my God.
Obviously you're curious about stuff.
And that is completely normal.
And guys are really bad at it in the beginning.
Not that I want you to be with an older guy.
Hey that's okay.
In fact, that's great.
Marriage is a patriarchal tool invented to enslave women.
All men are adult babies.
Why do I keep giving everyone the wrong sex talk? When did you No.
You know, you talk.
And I want you to be happy.
And you should never be afraid to tell me anything about yourself.
Open up.
One in the morning, eh? Okay.
Anyway, she never actually told me.
Alex did.
[chuckles] - You don't sound great.
- I'm not great.
And a cape.
Huh.
My reaction could really affect Elena for the rest of her life.
She needs to think that I'm cool with everything because I don't want her to turn out like, no offense, you.
Fun fact, did you know monocles had a huge following in the stylish lesbian circles of the early 20th century? If this is your way of telling me that you're getting me a monocle for my birthday, I'm gonna be really upset.
Or we could talk about Gaga instead.
All she's talked about the past two weeks is my stupid dance with Josh.
[sighs] Right.
Head high, shoulders back.
Straighter.
I'm so pumped.
Travel team is the first step toward the big leagues.
But congratulations, papito! - That's great news! - [clapping] - That's terrible news.
- Huh? There is no way he can join that team.
We're Cuban.
We don't trust anyone, outside of blood, to look after our kids.
[both scoffing] All right.
You think you got what it takes? Bedtime? 9:00 p.
Mami, I got this.
Preferred sandwich, tuna or turkey? Trick question.
Point that toe Move the hips - Not like that.
- Oh.
How am I going to keep you two lovebirds apart? - Oh! [chuckles] - [laughing] Oh, whoa! This is giving me flashbacks of Tiana's quinces/baby shower.
She is jealous.
Finn's mom is, what she calls, out-of-town single.
But don't worry, I got my eye on the ball.
- [chuckles] You did? And I think it's beautiful.
[gasps] You do? Claro.
[laughing] I told you.
Wait, so you're not okay with it? No, I am very upset.
I'm sorry, but I have a problem with Elena being gay.
- [breathes deeply] - It goes against God! Although, God did make us in his image.
So, tell me, when is the parade? [laughs] Okay, you guys wait here.
I'll check for intruders, put a safety lock on the toilet seat, and sweep for tuna.
Okay, stop.
Stop! So, you're obviously tired from the game.
[clears throat] I spy, with my little eye, something that is clearly a fire hazard! Hey, Mr.
Schneider, can you go get us some ice? What? Is someone injured? Oh, my God.
[chuckles nervously] Okay, I'm a mess.
I need some gay guidance.
Does she all of a sudden think all boys are disgusting? No! She always thought they were disgusting.
Okay.
She's gonna have a full life and be okay.
- Thank you.
- How would that help? - Honestly, I don't think it would, but I'm getting some serious eyes from that guapa over there.
I thought you were here to give me guidance.
[Ron chuckles] Don't worry.
The boys are fine.
What can I say Cubans are crazy about family.
Oh, you Cuban? Not by birth, but spiritually, I identify as Cuban.
Ay, Dios mÃ­o.
- Don't mess it up.
[clears throat] And I hate myself for it.
Keep the Queen-a-Coladas coming.
I always imagined that we would bond over boy stuff.
How hot they are, how dumb they are.
Let's get real.
Do you love her any less? No, of course not.
[laughs] Oh, this means so much coming from a super-hot gay guy.
Oh, thank you! [chuckles] I'm not gay.
I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize for the smelling and the groping.
Somehow when I thought you hated the touch of women I assumed it was okay.
Hi! Wait.
It's 11:00 at night.
Wait, I don't understand.
If he's okay, why didn't you just call? [scoffs] Because there's, like, a zero percent chance you would believe Alex was all right unless he was standing right in front of you.
You proved I can trust you.
- Really? - Yeah, you're Cuban now.
[knocking on door] Hi, Elena.
Hi, Carmen! Hi, Ms.
Whoo! You're in a good mood.
- Am I? - Yeah, why? Okay, I met a guy.
[chuckles] It'll happen.
And I hope you'll keep me in the loop when it does.
" - Should I text back? - No, no.
Play it cool.
My daughter said, "Fifth date, Dad.
" Don't bother coming home unless you get some.
My ex is coming back from Afghanistan for Elena's quinces, and she keeps texting me.
"Pick up his favorite soda.
[cell phone vibrating] - [Ben moaning] - [cell phone chimes] [grunting] That's me.
"Dear Lupe's friend.
See you next week.
Mami, I need some help in the kitchen.
I love Papi, but we have nothing in common.
Every time we Skype, we just stare at each other until one of us thinks the screen froze.
Plus, he's not even dealing with his PTS.
Oh, but he looks so healthy.
It makes more sense when the other three people are playing.
I wish you could be here.
[chuckles nervously] Looking good, viejita.
Vente pa' ca.
- None of that happened.
- [Victor] Yes.
Family doesn't stay in a hotel.
Would you want me to live in a hotel? - Hello? - No, no, no.
- He can stay out here.
- Ay, quÃ© cosa linda.
- Morning.
Hey, I made your favorite.
[sighs] - But, uh, I hope you like it, papito.
- [chuckles softly] Oh, maybe you can open that after Okay.
- [Victor chuckles] And for Elena [gasps] [Victor] I know that you're a little too old for it.
But hear me out, okay? She's a princess.
I'm Elena.
[imitates doll] "Hi.
We'll see you after school at the recital.
- Can't wait.
Yeah.
Without her list or her purse.
- That's great.
- Yeah.
So I'm just gonna put it out there.
I'm seeing somebody.
But, uh, tonight, me and him have a thing.
- Okay.
That was funny.
Oh, hey, man.
Uh I never come down here shirtless or pantsless.
I never come down here.
Come on, man.
You should come.
Keep walking, viejo.
[laughing] What What happened to love is the quilt of passion? Yeah, that quilt is too old.
Early onset dementia.
Sad.
That's what I said when you went over.
Yeah.
- No recital today.
- [all groan] I really wanted to show you in front of everybody.
I mean I'm not looking for a father figure.
All right, we need a diversion until they get back.
[cheers and applause] - [mouths] Thank you.
- [mouths] You're welcome.
What do you say, Mamita? - Yes.
- Great.
They're amazing! How did you know I would like this? Well, I did a little research.
And, uh, well, somebody told me you were What was it? Annoying.
I wanna Dance Dance Revolution.
Don't you have a dinner thing? Oh, that's right.
- Okay, let's do it.
I'm gonna beat you, Papi.
[all laughing] [Victor] All right, let's set this thing up, guys.
Lupe, one sec.
Wow.
[both chuckle] Thank you.
Are you intimidated by Sebastian and Peter? They have their problems, too, you know.
I've seen Peter fat-shame Sebastian.
[sighs] It's okay.
I get it.
Oh, no.
Stop smiling.
Nothing can happen.
[chuckles] And then nothing turned into Elena.
- [chuckles] - [gasps] Okay.
[stammering] Uh, I mean, what do we do? We call your sponsor, right? I mean, is he in Afghanistan? Here? What? Where is he? - No.
Okay, look, I'm off the pills, all right? And honestly, if I feel like having a couple of Coronas at the end of the day to take the edge off, that's that's a hell of a lot better than when I'd pop a fistful of Vicodin and watch 17 hours of HGTV.
[scoffs] Though I now know what a sconce is.
I'm working out.
- [sighs] Oh, God.
That is my problem.
And I can't have that problem here with the kids.
Lydia.
Lydia, hÃ¡blale.
- [giggles] - Listen up, grunts.
In 55 minutes, we have the final venue walkthrough.
Claro que sÃ­.
[speaking Spanish] Claro que sÃ­.
First arrivals are in 42 minutes.
And Schneider, I'm sorry that I'm in hyper-focused bitch mode, but really [sighs] thank you for doing this.
All white flowers? I got you.
Tables named after famous feminists? I had to do a lot of Googling, but, Elena, I got you.
You get a seat! You get a seat! Everybody gets a seat! So [clears throat] how are you feeling about Victor? Fine.
[chuckles softly] Yeah, fine, and I have you to thank for it.
What's wrong with it? Nothing.
I'm happy, I'm smiling.
This place is an acoustical nightmare.
Doc, what are you doing here? Practicing my toast, duh.
Where is the dance floor? Um, you're standing on it.
Are you kidding me? I have relatives who escaped from Cuba on a raft bigger than this.
- [Elena chuckles] - Hey.
Hi.
You help me sneak in the booze we bought at Costco.
Come on.
That, and I have grown up.
And I've learned a lot about myself since you've been gone.
Why are you doing this? [inhales deeply] Okay, so this wasn't the right time.
Just don't be mad.
No.
She's not She's not that way, okay? I've been gone a year.
It's my fault.
I kind of ambushed him and it's You didn't do anything wrong, baby.
Follow Olguitita's example.
[gasps] And what the hell is a carnation doing in here? Mami, a word? When was the last time you slept? Two days ago.
[Alex sighs] Hey, guys, what's taking so long? Oh, hi, Carmen.
Hi, Ms.
I told you I love every version of it See what I mean? Ay, Mami, we don't have time for this.
If the dress were truly perfect, she would be so overcome with emotion, her eyes would fill with tears.
I love that.
Keeping the dress, wearing the Docs.
Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡? - Hola.
- Ay, mira el niÃ±o tan lindo.
But first we will stop at El Pollo Loco on La Cienega Boulevard.
I'm running out of words.
Hey there.
What's up, Lupe? I just wanted to make sure everything was cool.
It's what kids do.
It's, like, cool now to be gay.
And you know how much it means to Elena for you to be at her quinces.
Does the whole family know? No.
It's up to Elena to decide who she tells and when.
But the one thing you do get to decide is whether you're gonna be there for your daughter.
The Fajardos are OG Cubans.
They run on Caribbean time.
It would be a pleasure.
[sighs] I feel like we dodged a bullet there.
[sighs] [breathes deeply] [snoring] [gasps] The Rosa Parks table should not be in the back! Where am I? Who put a blanket on me? Who brushed my teeth? [gasps] 10:03? Oh, my God! Is it the morning? Oh, my God! [panting] What? Did I die? Is this heaven? - [knocking on door] - Open up, it's Schneider.
[groaning] Oh, God, it's hell.
Whoa, I've never said that to a woman before.
Don't mess with me, weirdly sexy Schneider.
I can't believe you pulled this all together.
Look at the centerpieces! Ay, Tina.
[sighs] Okay, so I have made a few adjustments to the dress.
Mami, I already checked that box.
Hello? [shouting] Hey, you guys! The room is yours.
Thank you, Mami.
Whether it's a tree, an animal, a friend or me.
She's taught me more about being strong selfless and true to yourself than I could have ever taught her.
[upbeat music playing] [speaks Spanish] [Lydia] Oye.
Mira.
So when you went in your room last night, you guys were Sewing.
What else did you think we Oh! QuÃ© mala.
Oh, you are welcome, mija.
[sniffs] I never tire of saying "I told you so.
[WHOOPING] Nope.
- [PENELOPE AND LYDIA] Boo! - Lame.
When she's boring the guy to death, grab the napkins and run.
Or I could just buy something? [SCOFFS AND LAUGHS] - You're hilarious.
That means "eyes.
" I know what it means.
- [TUTS] En espaÃ±ol I will rip your beard off and feed it to you.
En espaÃ±ol - Okay, Alex is up.
You know, my Cuban heritage.
Okay.
Thank you, Mami.
Alex, you gotta appreciate how these guys support you.
No.
No! Papito is not an age thing.
If you can't, then don't come anymore.
So he meant Tata and Pucha, right? Schnei-Schnei can still go to the games.
The turn? From beautiful boy to horrible teenager.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, well, there's no easy path through it.
Although, if you want some advice Yeah.
[CHUCKLES] Your baby boy is turning into a man.
Yeah.
It was weird how often he kissed me on the lips and asked me to marry him, but now I miss it, you know! You love your kids the same of course, and Elena's amazing, but Alex is just so cool.
And now he doesn't want to hang out with me anymore? I'm sorry.
Can I just smell his head for one minute? We're still at lunch.
Thank you.
You don't understand.
Well, make me understand.
This is not okay.
I'm gonna call the school and straighten this out.
Once at a baseball game, the other team was leaving on their bus and they saw me and yelled, "Build the wall.
" Oh, my God.
And unfortunately, this stuff happens here.
Not to you, but it happens.
Man, I feel for Alex.
You know, I get how this stuff builds up.
I've been called a beaner, and I think it's a compliment, 'cause Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, we all have pretty good beans.
No, no, Cubans have the best beans.
- Clueless? - Moocher? Trust fund man-child baby? I'll say it! The word is "white.
" I see it stunned you all into silence.
- Mami, don't say it.
- No, no, no, I am going to say it! The most terrible word in the world! [INHALES DEEPLY] Okay.
That one just has more power with your generation.
Well When it is being yelled at you as you are walking home from school, a teenage girl who can barely speak the language, you are thinking first, "It is a cat call.
It's amazing how lucky I've been.
Even these days, in this openly racist world, I've managed to never have an incident.
[CLEARS THROAT] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH AND CHUCKLING] [LAUGHS] - Yeah! Schneider! I didn't know you could speak Spanish! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] This is terrible! I can't be passing! I am a proud Latinx! What the hell is a Latinx? Is it a Cuban Kleenex? If so, then it is the best Kleenex! I mean, who even decides what Latinx looks like? I look Latinx! Of course you do! You're beautiful! I always thought you looked like Anne Hathaway.
No, no, no! Why are you so mad? Cubans are white.
Hey, you're still gay.
Yes! That's right! And a woman! I'm back in! Oppression is not the goal here, okay? We want peace, equality and most of all, no crappy kid yelling racist stuff at my son while he's trying to learn about stars.
I'm sorry I hit that kid.
I know.
And look, I wish I could say what happened to you today will never happen again, but it might.
'Cause there are a lot of jerks out there, and I don't know if it's worse now or not, but I know I would never want you to change who you are because of them.
I feel only peace.
- [CHUCKLES] Alex, you have something on your chin.
Hi.
I'm the lady from the table over there.
Yeah.
It was a very poor choice of words.
And sometimes we can be a little racist, too.
Which is why we should all be free to enjoy the rich diversity of this great nation.
All right, let's get out of here.
Dale, Lupita, dale.
- Oh! [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
I need it to study for my stupid test on Tuesday.
She never blinks.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Okay, come on, everybody, let's go! Oh, that bath really woke me up.
Just eat a lot of taffy, they'll come off on their own.
Mom, please.
That's right.
And we really showed the patriarchy that men can no longer strut around with zero self-awareness, and shove their masculinity in our faces.
Anyway, can you post these flyers for me on campus? Oh! Are you too busy? Slammed.
I barely have time to meditate before my sunset hike.
Those kids are terrible.
Wait, here, here.
on the dot.
[BOTH] Early is on time.
I got school on top of everything else.
It's got Mama beat.
She sprays me, too.
With cologne.
Hear you roar.
You go, girl.
There's no going back now! Literally, the future of this office rests on these shoulders.
[CHUCKLES] Boy, you are tight.
Okay, snack time, children.
Look at them, so excited about food.
I'm planning on starting a GSA at school.
A Gay-Straight Alliance.
We get it.
You're here, you're queer, we're used to it.
It's all about the sound.
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona! Okay, put that away! [SIGHS] Everybody, go do your work so I can do mine.
- Yeah, it's kinda - [SHUSHES] I have a huge test tomorrow.
I really need you to let me work, okay? I get it.
See, I realized that women were just another one of my addictions, like alcohol, drugs, gambling, cigarettes, snow globes.
Snow globes? Is that like a drug thing? [CHUCKLES] Wow! [GASPS] Is this one of our family? Hey, you should probably get back to studying.
No disrespect, but I don't need to take advice from you.
- ["WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU" PLAYING] - Hey! Uh-huh Hey! Oh, my God! This is amazing! Plus, it's the perfect substitute for dating, 'cause it burns a lot of energy and also numbs my junk! All right! Get up out of the saddle! [WHOOPS AND EXCLAIMS] Homeostasis is the process of maintaining a relatively constant internal environment despite changes in the external environment! Yeah! - [SCHNEIDER GRUNTS] - [THUDS] I'm okay.
" And then they gave me a meeting room and a snack budget! Okay, I'm sleep-deprived, but I think she said happy words in a mad voice? What? Like I'm supposed to believe my Catholic school is suddenly pro-gay? Yeah, nice try! You know, I think being a lesbian has made you very angry.
That is such a stereotype! Is it? Well, I have a lot to be angry about.
[SOFTLY] Yeah, not everybody.
Maybe not one person in particular? [SCOFFS] You mean my father, who's not even as progressive as the Catholic church? So that's what this is about.
It's just hard because I want to hate him but he's still my dad.
Oh, baby.
I'll get it.
Here, here, here, here.
You're always killing it.
We know because you always say, "I'm killing it.
[CHUCKLES] That's the thing.
75? - [ELENA GASPS] - [LYDIA GROANS] 68? [INHALES SHARPLY] 62! I would faint, but I don't want a below-average nurse to help me.
What? Really? Mom, this is your dream.
Yes.
We can yell together.
Oh, that's gonna be great, because you're so loud! This is great.
Lupita.
Carlos, it undoes in the front.
Ma! Lupita, after you went to bed last night, none of us could sleep.
We realized we were being selfish.
Then you got this.
And we got you.
Hey, Elena.
Who are all these peeps? What's up, peeps? Okay, so stop saying "peeps.
" Syd.
My pronouns are "they" and "them.
I guess you think it's too violent, huh? No, we love that part.
When you create your avatar, there are only two gender non-binary characters.
" You mean "them.
" No, "they" is "them.
Got it? - [ALL] Got it! [MARGAUX] Let's march! She must have practiced that.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] We got a stabilized GSW.
Do everything she just said.
Penelope Alvarez? Oh, my God.
[BOTH LAUGH] - Sorry to hear that.
[CHUCKLES] - Yeah, same.
Here you go, Lydia.
A little gift to grab those hard-to-reach items.
There was no one in the building because it's Saturday.
A security guard said if we came back next week, we can tour the building and get T-shirts.
What a nice group of human people friends.
I heard about the pronoun thing.
And we're not talking about this.
Besides, Mom says I'm too young to date.
That's how I get pork loin at half price.
- Wait, what's going on? - Elena has a crush.
- Fine, can we be done now? - Look, people get crushes.
Maybe you see this person and instantly your knees get weak and your brain starts to melt, and you think maybe I'm not dead inside.
[MEOWS] Hey, there.
Did you get through your second day okay? Yep.
I mean, it was good.
It was real good.
- But I don't know him well enough - Yeah.
I'm not interested in the boring history of your friendship.
I'm a mother.
I'm sex negative.
Obviously.
I was just telling Pene about our sitch.
You don't even have to like them.
Hands.
I haven't been there! The pool of local lesbians my age is not that big.
They could all fit in one pool.
What I'm really afraid of is that I'll ask Dani out and she'll give me one of those "Oh" - What does that mean? - It means, "I'm not gay and you think I am and now we have a situation.
" You got all that from, "Oh?" I'm just scared.
What? Havana, 1958, I was madly in love with a young boy from the country, Flavio.
We were both 14.
But yes, really.
And as I walked home, I heard the healing sounds of the mambo and I followed my ears to this little dance hall.
Maybe you're right.
I mean, it beats what I've been doing.
Hi.
I was hoping I could bump into you.
Let's go back to this twin thing.
I'm serious.
Shut up! Yeah, no, it can never happen again.
Why not? [STUTTERS] I get, like, little chunks of 45 minutes here and there.
'Cause I like you.
But I don't want to do the hook-up thing, and I don't have time for the romantic thing.
Oh, pobrecito.
That is so sad.
My kids will be home in 25 minutes.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get there.
Just ChapStick.
Oh, nice! Gay.
- No, no! Gay! Me, gay! [CHUCKLES] Oh.
Uh, me gay, too.
And by "them," you mean just Syd? Yes! [CHUCKLES] I'm at the top of my class, and I finished all my homework, and Yes.
- Yes? - Yes.
You work too hard.
 Oh, man, I really wanted to see you tonight, Max.
Bye.
What's up? I need money.
It's in color and everything.
A ticket costs $9.
All my friends get way more cash from their parents.
What have I told you about comparing yourself to other people? To always do it and make sure I'm better.
Oh, my God.
- [KISSING] Come on.
Some people's faces are worth protecting.
Papito knows what I'm talking about.
I have something better than all that, that will cut through the red tape.
Ha! Ha! - Ha! - Abuelita, be careful! Oh, I know.
Proposition, the letter "U.
" It's a ballot measure in next week's local election.
[CHUCKLES] But you don't mean you never vote? Like, you voted in the last election? Oh, the last one? No.
And now we have that monster in the White House! Well, don't blame me.
I vote every four years like I'm supposed to.
What about primaries, midterm elections, local elections? Yeah, I don't care about that stuff.
Vote, don't vote, it doesn't matter.
We always end up with the same comebolas.
- So you'll do it? - Yes.
Yes.
Hey, guys.
[LAUGHING] Great.
Five-second rule.
Abuelita, I want to study the election issues with you.
" Oh, that's easy, 'cause I love teachers.
I am a teacher.
- I didn't hear anything.
- Coming! Oh! Don't you look pretty? [LAUGHS] I know there's no one out there! Where did you get your hair done? See? Pretty great, right? Nothing keeps popcorn fresher than a shower cap you snagged from a hotel room.
You're welcome.
And we saved eight dollars.
The usher will hear you.
You have to wait for an explosion.
Abuelita, come on! Where are you? I am right here.
I am so sorry, everybody, but I'm having trouble walking, and I cannot vote today.
This is perfect! Abuelita, we can stop to get Schneider's insensitive wheelchair, which I have a lot to say about, just not now, and then we can head to the polls.
- Let's go! - [SCHNEIDER] All right.
- Abuelita? - [ALEX] Abuelita? - [SCHNEIDER] Lydia? [PENELOPE] Mami! Lydia? Mami? My leg is feeling better.
[SCOFFS] Mami, what's going on? Why are you acting like such a loca? Are you afraid to vote? I mean, is it because in Cuba, any act of political expression was met with violent repercussions? Yeah, sure.
Which, of course, is what we call lovemaking.
Okay, Mami.
So it's almost the same thing.
It's no big deal.
I'll download the forms.
We'll get you in line to become a citizen.
Right here.
Can't stop thinking about Abuelita.
I double-wrapped them - in wax paper and foil.
- Mmm.
"Confiscate"? [SCOFFING] Okay, Officer.
There's a jumbo soft pretzel in it for you if you keep walking.
But you know who else broke the rules? Our founding fathers.
[WHISPERS] I really don't know her.
If I shop at Walmart, I am killing mom and pop.
If I cook pork, I am somehow killing pigs! What's going on here? Abuelita won't even talk to me about becoming a citizen.
What? That doesn't make sense.
They should be importing us.
What's the problem? Hmm? - Don't you like being in this country? - Of course.
I like to be in America.
Yes.
But you know, maybe someday it will.
Being cubana is who I am.
So much so, that I even bring it up now and then.
When people ask me what I am, I say, "I'm a human being not defined by labels or the artificial construct of borders.
" But I also say I'm Cuban.
- [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] - [CAN HISSING] What the hell am I doing? Hey, I've been thinking about what happened at the movies.
[SCOFFS] Me, too, papito.
You guys better get on the road.
You don't want to be late for Comic-Con.
I'm dressed as the Fourth Doctor.
Pretty sure people are going to want to take pictures with us, which is the ultimate Comic-Con win.
Berkowitz has been teaching me Yiddish.
The kid's a natural.
Liquor cabinet's locked.
No large dogs.
Mmm.
Talking is a good thing.
[SIGHS] You guys gotta get moving.
Let's go! Come on! I have so much studying to do.
Didn't have to, just felt cool.
Maybe I'll meet your family for real next time.
It's not a sexy place.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] What's that? Oh! It's just a police helicopter.
Great, great, great, great, great.
There's a police helicopter out there.
Maybe it's the Daleks.
"Exterminate.
He is Comic-Con.
I think we're gonna be stuck here for a while.
Feet on the ground.
Alex will check on you.
Water purification pills, MREs, enough cash to get us to Cape Verde by boat, just the basics.
[SIGHS] Anyway, you're safe now that I'm here.
Maybe he is, I don't know him that well.
What are you talking about? They were supposed to be gone, and he was just here, and we were supposed to, you know - Oh.
I would be so honored.
Look, right now our relationship is, like, the perfect little fantasy.
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] - Oh.
A Wrinkle in Time.
Oh.
Are you "shurbly-burbly"? Help me make things less awkward.
Okay, okay.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
No, no, no.
You are too handsome to be a killer.
- Yeah.
[LYDIA] No, no, no, no.
I'm not going to do that, Syd! I won't be Syd anymore! I'll kill you! [CELL PHONE RINGS] Ooh, they're FaceTiming me from the Bar Mitzvah.
Yeah, this can't be my background.
- Okay.
- Hey.
Wow.
This is so good.
But, look, there is one right here.
Actually, I'm more like my dad.
Well, make fun of me all you want, but every woman needs a man.
- [CLEARS THROAT] - [SIGHS] Most women need a man.
Right.
Got it.
Oh, great.
Way to let me down easy.
Oh, because you're the one who kissed me first, so you're the protector? - That is so reductive.
- [CHUCKLES] How about we protect each other? Deal.
You're like a male Wonder Woman.
That's your go-to? Stop scaring everyone, all right? Nobody's breaking in.
So what, Leslie? It's good to be a coward? I'm afraid so.
So many of our heroes were cowards.
Of course, they wouldn't give us something from the registry.
Well, I love Papi, but that's a mistake.
How dare you keep something like this from me.
Relax, it isn't even loaded.
We were helpless.
So, it is good to live in a country that lets you protect yourself! Now that Victor is gone, it's only just three women and a papito, all alone! - [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] - Look what's going on.
But no matter where you hide it, kids find it.
And accidents happen.
It's okay.
But we're turning that in to the police, got it? Okay, okay.
And you.
It's a good thing that we're just casual acquaintances, otherwise, I'd be pretty embarrassed.
So, what do you say, sponsor? Lunch tomorrow? Yeah! Sure, dude.
Let's do it.
They say I have quite the green thumb.
Oh? Nothing dies on my watch.
It's nice meeting you idiota.
Mami, I know your secret.
Okay.
[SIGHS] Look, I was in the army.
And that guy? Max? What? I know he has a girlfriend, but whatever, - you could take her, Mom.
- [LAUGHS] Okay.
I don't know whose bra this is, but she has a wild side, and I'm into it.
Can you do some work for once? Ah, what's the point? I change a light bulb.
Look in that basket.
There's a bald eagle thong.
You need to pay for those or send them back.
I thought you wanted to get a summer job.
Berkowitz needs somebody in the office to help with filing.
Oh But if he goes to work with you, I barely get to see him.
I started my own channel on Twitch.
It's a site where you make money when people watch you play video games.
No, no.
Penelope, this could be huge.
By the end of the summer, my right arm looked like Popeye, the left one looked like Olive Oyl.
Then I joined the army.
I do like that you are showing initiative, so I'm gonna give you one week.
Thank you, Mom.
Alex, you are about to see your mom in action.
She is the best at what she does and commands respect.
- I'll call, soon as I get the results.
- Thank you.
So I can remember how innocent I was before you forced me to work here.
Heh.
[SNIFFS] I thought I smelled your mother.
Oh, I feel so proud of my little genius doctorcito.
It's so good that your mother is here.
You know, now, maybe, she could watch me do my thang.
Oh? Does someone need a napkin? No.
So, how was your day? Wanna talk? Nah, I'm good.
It is.
It's so boring! So much of your day is shining a light in people's noses and filling out forms.
I just wanna say, it's a real honor playing as a woman.
A real pleasure.
Peace in the real world, chaos everywhere else.
AdiÃ³s! Sorry, I was wrong.
I'm so inspired.
Makes me wanna get a job.
You just came on the wrong day.
It's usually much more exciting.
You gotta see this rash.
His nipples are the eyes.
Of course.
Of course.
So, Thai food at home or duck Ã  l'orange at a candlelit bistro? Look, Doc, my grandma likes you.
You just need to be a little more chill.
No, I would have waited if I knew it was gonna cost me money.
[INHALES, EXHALES] Know what? I'm gonna go to Dr.
I discovered that the coffee machine also makes hot cocoa.
What? Total game changer.
I'll wait till you push play.
[SCREAMS AND PANTS] Okay, guys.
Por ejemplo, the American flag is red, white and blue.
The Cuban flag is red, white, and blue.
No, no, no.
Get out of here! I'm falling behind.
I'm almost there.
Just one more What? What is Hey, guys.
What's wrong with you? I need you to breathe.
I'm going crazy.
Then it got hard and tedious and not fun.
It's just more like - A job? - Yeah.
There you go.
The point is, you have the rest of your life to hate your job.
I thought it was some sort of strained muscle, but your mother, she could tell something was off.
So we sent Liese in for more tests.
This showed up after you left, and I knew you had a pretty rough day, so I thought I would run it over.
- Thanks, Doc.
Leslie, can I make you a plate for dinner? I wish I could, but I'm busy.
You are? Doing what? I don't know! [CHUCKLES] Guys, look at Baby Penelope.
Get yourself a little something on me.
- I'm gonna kill you! - No! No! [BOTH SCREAMING] Whatever.
But it's really that I'm more of a manager than a "worker," per se.
So I hired an assistant to handle all the basics around the building while I focus on the big-picture stuff.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES] [CHUCKLES] You're the one with the girlfriend.
Yeah.
- Did he mention where he was going? - I didn't ask.
Did he mention who he was going with? Mami, I don't know.
- Okay.
He just checked in downtown at the opera.
Abuelita, are you okay? I am fine, papito.
I am very, how do you say Very chill.
How are you gonna afford it? Hummer limo's downstairs.
- She roped you into this? - Are you kidding? I'm thrilled! My third stepmother used to take me to the racetrack to spy on Father.
Also, you're not allowed to have a girlfriend or keep secrets.
Hey, how are you and Max doing? [SHUSHES] That's a secret.
There are seven days in a week.
Yeah, but he doesn't have time to meet anybody else.
Not yet.
[GASPS] What is it? I found him.
Leslie just took the hand of a beautiful woman who was sitting on his other side.
How dare he have other friends! It's like I'm back at the racetrack with my stepmom.
- No! [LAUGHS] I need to know you're not sleeping with anyone else.
Oh Okay.
[CHUCKLES] She's hairy but pretty cute.
I'm petsitting for my cousin while she's in Orlando.
Penelope, I am not sleeping with anyone else.
And I'm really happy you want to be exclusive.
Aw I'm really not.
- Is it her? - No.
I mean, I made this happen.
And I'm a girl, who likes girls, which means I know everything there is to know about girls.
- I like her, too.
We like her.
Great! Okay, now let's plan the perfect date.
Look up left-handed-friendly restaurants in Los Angeles.
Wow! She really hauled fondillo outta here.
Nice shade.
Ah [CHUCKLES] And you? A date, too, with a much younger man.
Oh - Good for you.
[IN SPANISH] Wait a minute.
You speak Spanish? [IN SPANISH] Of course.
It probably disintegrated with age.
Leslie deserves better than you.
Dating someone is getting to know them, wearing pants.
Sleeping with someone is not getting to know them, not wearing pants I get it! So, what? Now I need to have another conversation with Max to see if he's dating other women? Or you could just stalk him on Instagram.
And think about where he works! Just give me that damn phone.
Oh He's tagged in so many photos with Really? Leggymeggy35? Here they are at a barbecue, at a Dodgers game.
Don't you think it's unfair to expect a commitment when you're not interested in dating him? - I don't want to.
- Then he's allowed to date other people.
I knew it! What's going on? I checked Instagram and I saw that you were tagged in a bunch of photos by Leggymeggy35.
So, who is that? [SIGHS] Look, Penelope I love spending 45 whole minutes with you a week.
Glad you're happy.
Still gonna need to hear you say it.
Why? She's my cousin.
What? Why didn't you just tell me that? And miss all this? - You're good.
- Hi.
[CHUCKLES] Tell me, Max.
Meeting a friend for pizza? I think I might be hungry for pizza, too.
Okay.
I know, Leslie.
And I understand.
No.
Esme is not going to be comfortable with you coming here to grab something that I cannot reach or dry the dishes or water the plants.
Thank you, Lydia.
I'm sure Esme This will make her very happy.
 [THEME SONG PLAYING] [BREATHES DEEPLY] Here she is! Ten fingers, ten toes.
[BABY GURGLING] Do we have a name for her yet? Elena Maria Alvarez Riera Calderon Leytevidal Inclan.
Ooh.
Yep, I can.
[CHUCKLES] Everything's fine.
Are you one of our doctors? - If you are, how do we get a new one? - [DR.
He's very much alive.
He just hates me.
- Okay.
- Your father reinstalled it.
- Yes! - [GRUNTING] - Oh.
Does it hurt? - A little.
[GASPS] Papito's gay too? I will be the only woman he's ever loved? Okay, I'm good.
No.
I'm not upset because you saw your father.
You should be able to see your father.
Mirtha says she returned the mantilla, but I know she stole it.
I will never forget this as long as I live! Ay, mi vida, it is a piece of lace.
[SIGHS] Bueno, I cannot believe you took Elena out in public looking like that.
Mami, for the last time, a baby does not need earrings.
Who are you? [CHUCKLES] Schneider, property manager.
Here are your keys.
Ah.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] I'm going to make sure we got all your boxes from the truck.
[SCOFFS] You just had a baby.
Ooh.
Caballero, por favor, let me.
Oye, chico, I got it.
- This cell phone was a great investment.
Plus, I look cool.
- [GASPS] Oh, of course.
I am so sorry.
- You can take the bedroom next to ours.
- [LAUGHS] Victor, stop talking! What are you doing? They can't move in with us! And they definitely can't move into the bedroom next to ours, okay? They are very affectionate! Okay Look.
- [CHUCKLES] - It's never happened before! [CHUCKLES] This will help us get on our feet, okay? It's an investment in our future.
[BABY CRYING] Okay.
- Salud.
- Salud.
- [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Okay, so I'm guessing you've figured out I've seen Alex a couple of times.
You thought it was okay to go behind my back and see him? I'm sure you would have liked it if I cleared it with you, but I'm only in town for a little while.
You also have a right to see your daughter.
She's not my biggest fan right now.
When? Because it's been almost a year.
[VICTOR SIGHS] I don't understand what happened.
[GASPS] And there's coffee too? I can get used to this.
Buenos dÃ­as, Lupe! - Well, now I don't need the coffee.
She must be hungry.
- Okay.
[KATIE COURIC] from Boston to Los Angeles, but we're just getting initial reports of that.
Again, we must tell you we're trying to get as much information but it is trickling in at a very slow pace.
Thank you, good night, and God bless America.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] - Lupe, can I talk to you? - Yeah.
Finish our service, get our careers going, and then start our family.
I know.
I have a responsibility to protect her future and her freedom.
That's what a soldier does.
But you're right.
We need to do this.
It's my turn.
You know, I've thought a lot about what happened, and I'll spare you the details about the anger, and the crying, and the weight loss, and the empty space on my wall where your picture used to be.
Oh, and one more thing.
I learned some really cool stuff about myself.
And that sucks.
'Cause I'm pretty great.
Yeah.
I guess I did that.
DÃ¡melo.
My whole life has been your turn! [LYDIA CHUCKLES] You better get used to this.
 I can't believe you met when my mom treated you in Afghanistan.
- What was your injury? - I got shot in the face.
Don't.
Yeah.
I was there.
Yeah.
Mami! [EXCLAIMS] Don't forget to take your pill! She's old, so she's got to take a lot of stuff.
She's forgetful, so the reminder's on my phone.
- Okay, Mami, could you - Okay.
Okay.
You got me by the cojones and I respect it.
Hey, how about we both go off our pills? And there will be so much more room in the medicine cabinet for rouge and lipstick.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] My panic attacks are starting to come at some weird places, y'all.
I don't get it, because when I was a gunner I made 100 decisions a second.
I don't even realize I'm in a bad place until I'm bingeing Keeping Up with the Kardashians and I'm weeping.
God! I feel bad for those people and I definitely should not.
It's me, Penelope"? - That sounds stupid.
- Yeah, that sounds stupid, Pam.
Plus, she's got a hot new boyfriend.
Speaking of tools gathering dust under my bed! [LAUGHS] Yes, girl, yes! But, no, no, no! Come on! He's more than that.
- That's right! We don't! And if you ever do, papito has instructions to break me out.
Relax.
[GASPS] If I hadn't been taking my medication like you told me to, I would be having a stroke.
- [CACKLES] - Come on! Therapy served its purpose and I'm really glad I did it, but I'm feeling like myself again.
It could not have gone better.
Somebody asked me if I was your sister.
It's not cool.
It's disrespectful.
- Okay.
Mami, why don't you take the kids without me? - Huh? - Yeah.
- Is someone chasing you? - Oh, my God, are they still here? - What? No.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES] Max, stop.
But you're off your meds? - Like your antidepressants? - Yeah.
Wow Your mom said you stopped going to therapy, but this, too, huh? So your doctor thought you were ready or Didn't do it through my doctor.
I know you're upset, but you don't have to take it out on me.
- Please.
Did you forget to set your alarm? I'm not gonna go to work today, 'cause I don't feel well.
[SCOFFS] Â¿Y? I once went to work with a temperature of 104.
I'm not hungry.
Okay.
Max's father will love you and his mother will still respect you.
[SPEAKS SPANISH] What is wrong? Por favor.
I'm not gonna go tonight.
What? Tell me what to do.
Mami, believe me! I know! Please, could you just leave me alone? Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It has been a week since my last confession.
m.
to do my makeup and clean the sponges.
Thank you, Padre JosÃ©.
I will try.
Whoa.
Hey! Hey.
Maybe too tired to be what they need.
[CRYING] I want so badly for them to grow up and live full, happy lives.
That woman is not okay.
I know what the last part sounds like, but I promise I would never do anything like that.
Wanna go for a drive? There's got to be another way to feel happy.
[SIGHS] So it's Fourth of July, 2011.
There's something I want that I can't have for the rest of my life.
And there's something you don't want that you have to have for the rest of yours.
You do not have the gift.
Why are you still awake? [SCOFFS] I was worried about you.
What? You do what you need to do to fix yourself.
And I will be here for you.
Could've been useful two days ago when you stood up my parents.
My dad still insisted on ordering in Spanish.
And if I don't take the medication, it's not good.
You're a veteran.
Why don't all three of us Netflix and chill? [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Papito, taste the pollo con ajo.
Nice work.
As my father said to me on my ninth birthday, "You don't need me anymore.
I was driving in freaking circles, looking for a spot.
I had to park by the lake again and get chased by the geese.
Anyway, of course you have a garage.
It's downstairs.
There's a box of raincoats somewhere.
Whatever, Mami, I am too excited to argue.
Instead of your own abuelita, you think of the planet? So you just keep your filthy green hands off my Vanidades magazines.
What about all this fabric? Come on! There must be something in here we can get rid of.
[CHUCKLES] I'mma keep this.
Okay, your first solo mission as a handy ma'am.
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.
Oh, oh, one more thing.
You're gonna see a glass in there with teeth in it.
Hey, Schneider.
[SHUSHES] [SIGHING] What's up? So this is what Schneider looks like at his most Schneider-y.
It's at least an hour-and-a-half job.
For you, maybe.
I am the mentor here, Little Miss Thang.
I may only look two or three years older than you, but I have the wisdom of that ancient bonsai! - You just said - It's all the same stuff! [SCOFFS] Was that me? Not every gay, teenage, Cuban girl figurine is you! Well, my car got hit! - [GASPS] No! - Are you okay? Yes, because I wasn't in it.
As a matter of fact, I already did.
Alex, is that true? Uh Of course it is true.
You've worked on that all day, haven't you? Don't be absurd! Herb said that they don't want you working at their apartment anymore because they didn't like your attitude.
What? That's crazy.
So you watched Jeopardy with them and then what? Why would I watch TV with them? I just fixed their stuff and left.
[HYPERVENTILATING] Well, now we know what your problem is! You fixed their toilet, but you didn't fix their souls.
- 402, listen to all their Cuban nonsense - Excuse me? That's the job.
That's what takes four hours.
And there will be a next time.
So, I'm not fired? Nah, I just said that to be dramatic.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Aww.
It's my mom, holding hands with my son, who's dressed as my dad.
Nobody wore a guayabera like your Papi.
Okay, Mami, I can see how keeping some of this stuff around might be nice.
It's not that big of a deal.
I hid my savings bonds in the pages of one of those Vanidades to keep them safe.
- Thank you.
Nope.
I love cancer patients.
So, out back? Okay.
Let The Love Boat set its course for happiness.
- Pretty progressive - Mmm.
I love Marshalls.
And I would shop there even more.
You pack it away forever! Some of them are for special occasions! Oh, like the precious china we've never even seen? I was keeping it safe for you, to pass it down to Alex and Elena, so they could pass it down to their children! Why don't we pass down an empty box that says "China"? It'll be lighter! Mami, you have a problem.
There is an entire television show devoted to people like you.
And Berto opened this and put it over us.
And he said, "I will always protect you, mis vidas.
I think I do.
[EXCLAIMS] Elena, these shelves are amazing.
How about I make us all some dinner to celebrate? - [GASPING] And we can eat it on the china.
- Ooh.
Ay, Elena, your homecoming dance is only 36 hours away.
If I pluck your eyebrows with both hands I may be able to separate them in time.
Okay.
Well, she had an epic big ask.
["WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE" KARAOKE PLAYING ON PHONE] [SNAPPING FINGERS] [SINGING] Harriet Tubman, Mass Effect Frida Kahlo, full respect Queer theory, gender theory Notorious RBG Women's march, science march Labor march Tax march, equal rights, Bathroom rights Diversity on TV Do we have to watch the rest of this? That is a big ask.
Slam poets, Supergirl You're the cutest in the world Bell hooks, PokÃ©mon Cookie Om-nom-nom-nom-nom! L Word, Will and Grace RuPaul's Drag Race Shantay, you stay What else do I have to say? You set my heart on fire On that day When I didn't know if you were gay You set my heart on fire So please say yes You don't even have to wear a dress Will you go to the dance with me? [GIGGLES] Yes! Of course I'll go! - What? But I thought you said - Shut up! [THEME SONG PLAYING] I am ready.
[SCOFFS] Plus he is charming, he's sexy, he's tan.
He claims to be a gringo, but all signs point to cubano.
I'll make the hours up soon, okay? Okay, but Uh-uh.
The deadline is Sunday.
What? I don't have that kind of money.
I packed these so we could soft boil them in the Jacuzzi.
All of your friends? Yeah, so, um Syd kinda thinks I'm really popular.
[CHUCKLES] Oh Wow! Love really is blind.
Maybe you're the ding-dong.
I'm sorry we're not sippin' margaritas by a pool right now.
She did not buy "My boobs are square.
" [LAUGHS] It's like she had a way of sneaking up and yelling at me with her demonic voice.
I turned out pretty okay.
Oh, that's nice.
I This is Max.
Thank you for helping out today, Max.
I'd like to introduce you to Schneider, my boyfriend.
Yep, I'm her boyfriend, which is not news to me.
Well, I don't have another dress, so what do we do? Hey, Mom.
This is Emma.
Tag me when you post it.
Jay-Z is your favorite artist.
I love you.
You what? Hello? What? What? What? Oh, hi, Penelope.
- Sure.
Finally, I get to hang with the cool kids.
- Why are you still standing here? Run! - [CHUCKLES] - Pen! - What? Oh, thank God.
Did you hear what Nikki said to Sister Barbara? - She thinks I'm her boyfriend? - I can't stress how little I care.
I wanted to ask, when we hung up you said something [UPBEAT SONG PLAYING] This is my jam! But wait Oh, damn! This is my jam too! It takes two to make a thing go right It takes two to make it outta sight It takes two to make a thing go right Oh.
Hi, Sister Barbara.
- What up, girl? Hey, how is your Susan B.
Anthony claymation coming along? Thank you for texting me all those updates.
My request.
Hello, Leslie.
All my best bad girl stuff was done here.
[CHUCKLES] I'm just glad we escaped Sister Barbara's sexy clutches.
- [CHUCKLES] - [SIGHS] What can I say? The power of Christ compelled me.
I wasn't planning on telling you in a stinky choir robe that smells like incense and Fritos.
[COUGHING] God! Why did I ever like this? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Sister Barbara! What do you need to talk about that's so important? After a grueling 30 minutes of thought Nikki, will you be my starter wife? Schneider, I don't wanna get married.
I just got divorced.
- [GASPS] You used me, Nikki, Finn's mom! And not in the way I like! Oh Ew.
Kids are so gross.
Look.
I know why you haven't introduced me to any of your friends.
- Then why did you say yes? You were so excited.
And your big ask was amazing.
I don't care that you don't have any friends.
Aw I don't care that you don't have any friends.
Mrs.
Wallace.
Oh, Leslie, I am sorry.
How dare she! Esa boba thinks that she can do better than a doctor just because his arms happen to be longer than his legs? Actually, I broke up with her.
Papito, what happened to your date? Did you find out she was an undercover cop here on assignment? [SIGHS] Turns out she was just using me to make stupid Travis Aarons jealous.
- [LAUGHING] - Oh, not with my son.
So, get back on the dance floor and show the ladies what you got.
[SCOFFS] Please.
- Yeah.
They are pretty great, right? - Yeah.
[ALL] Salud.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Want me to help you clean up? Nah, you're gonna be an American.
Let the Latinos do it.
- So should I send Syd a chicken? - Girl, are you cray? Okay, how about a ghost, a ski lift, and the Swedish flag? No, the Swiss flag.
But what does that mean? Exactly.
[EXCLAIMS] So passive-aggressive.
Is everything okay? Yes.
[CHUCKLES] I don't want to have any kids.
It sounds like you need to tell Max that.
I mean, that baby would have everything.
Wait, are you actually thinking about this? I'm just saying I'd have a hot baby.
If you don't want a baby, don't be a baby.
Oh! You're right.
Oh, who needs that? Mmm-mmm.
So, Beth, what's been going on with you? Well [CHUCKLES] - I'm pregnant.
- Are you okay? - No! [SCOFFS] Last night, I was testing the pH of the water in my seahorse ranch and, as I looked at those vomiting little guys, I realized I suck at tests.
All tests.
Hello.
He seems nice.
Sure, Doc.
Why? You put a blood sample label on my pudding cup and sent it to the lab.
Me? As the sperm donor? A short, Latino me with hair? Oh, man, that baby'd have everything.
Okay.
Don't tell me that, Doc! Tell me I'm old and dried up, and that my uterus is full of sand.
Something that's gonna make me feel better.
Mostly square.
Sometimes line.
Wait.
New Jersey? She's straddling the border.
But you weren't arrested, so it doesn't count as a crime.
Oh, it was a crime.
" That is correct.
The fox is on the beach.
Which are you referring to? Please wait outside, Mrs.
Riera.
Maybe they make everyone wait while they figure out if you passed.
They didn't do that with me.
I'm sure everything's okay.
Maybe.
Welcome to America.
I love this country.
I'm just babysitting.
Okay, serious question, have you ever met a baby before? I'll have you know I babysat my babysitter's kids while she was babysitting my dad, so, yeah, I got a little experience under my belt.
- Hey.
[COOS] Hi.
He wants to have a baby.
- Whoa.
Thank you for reminding me that I do want to hold a baby again.
[SNIFFS] Someday, when I'm a grandmother.
Although you are dead wrong, it is a barf factory.
No, no.
It's about ten years too late for this conversation.
I'm turning 40, Max and talking about this isn't going to get any easier, the longer we wait.
And I'm done with it.
Oh.
I love your kids and I love you.
I love you too.
[LAUGHING] I took the crib out of storage because Schneider wanted it for the gordito that he is babysitting.
But I'm saving it for you now, because this is much more exciting.
I'll text him a slot machine, a bowl of ramen and a circus tent.
He'll come crawling back.
Walk away from the table, Mami.
Know when to fold 'em.
Really? 'Cause right now, I would love to be alone.
Yeah, but who's going to take care of you? I'm not going to be around forever.
I made a painful decision, and the last thing I need is for you to tell me what an idiot I am for having made it.
Oye.
We gotta get downtown for the swearing-in ceremony.
Mami? Look, if you're mad about yesterday, I am sorry that things got so heated.
Now she's in a medically-induced coma.
Just have to wait for her to wake up.
Your abuelita hates everything about crying.
Makes your eyes puffy, ruins your makeup, gives you mocos.
Elena, Papi on the nightstand, popes on the dresser, and Schneider by the waterfall in hazardous waste.
- What's up? - Oh, hi, Nurse Wally.
Why don't you two go get something to eat at the cafeteria? I swiped Nurse Wally's ID so you can get 10% off.
Mami, you go.
So, you'll never believe what happened at church today.
That's right, we went.
You know who Jesus said that to? Peter.
Parker? [MOUTHING] What? Anyway, a couple FYIs.
How's our girl? Just waiting for her to wake up.
You know she doesn't like being rushed.
No, no.
The more the merrier.
My mom will not be left alone for one second.
When my TÃ­a Mimi got sick, 13 of us spent the night praying at her bedside and she just had pink eye.
Anything happens, you text me.
I'll be here in a second.
You are the most alive person I know.
Whenever I'm around you, I feel like I'm in an opera.
[CHUCKLES] I get that.
But I think you might be the love of mine.
[GASPS] What? Her vitals are fine.
- She's not wearing earrings! - [GASPS] Out of the way.
More for me.
Let's go eat this in the hallway.
When I got home, you were so mad.
And you started going off on me in Spanish, and I I just didn't hear you.
[SNIFFLES] I lost my connection to you.
[SIGHS] And then last year came and I was so worried to come out to you.
Oh, my God.
Am I you? [GASPS] I should be so lucky.
What the hell is going on in here? - Wally's got a lot of stuff.
- [EXHALES] That felt good.
You would hate this lighting.
[SIGHS] Sorry you missed the citizenship ceremony.
But Father put his arm around me and he said, "Son, [CLEARS THROAT] only losers cry.
" So that was a long flight.
I thought I'd been doing a kickass job keeping my drug stuff a secret from all the tenants and then you showed up in my room at that clinic.
You brought me sopa de pollo and said it's Cuban penicillin.
Back then, it must have felt like you had this annoying, intrusive guy over.
Not like now.
- Too much? - Oh, definitely.
Pretty sure it's a fire hazard.
I understand.
If you'd like to join me, please.
Religion and science can live side by side.
Gracias, Padre.
It's not fair.
I mean, yeah, I said some unkind things.
[VOICE BREAKING] You didn't even say goodbye to me.
I never brought it up because whatever, man, life goes on.
So look at that.
Not a mistake after all.
You hear me, Mami? Because I understand now why you didn't say goodbye to me when I went to the army.
Because you were scared I wasn't coming back.
[SIGHS] [IN SPANISH] That beauty mark that you have Pretty darling Next to your mouth Don't give it to anyone Pretty darling For it is mine Ah, ah, ah, ah Sing and don't cry Because by singing they get happy Pretty darling, the hearts Hola, mi vida.
I am here to pick you up.
Berkowitz.
- [SCOFFS] Berto, he's just a friend.
The greatest gift.
And we make such good-looking ones.
Oh, right.
Don't tell her.
Get a job.
" And then there is Papito.
She's gonna fine.
Our daughter is magnificent.
Oh, thank God my nails are done.
- Mami! - [GROANING] Mami! Abuelita.
 [door opens] Who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who Bought one pizza and got two free?Â  That's meÂ  That's meÂ  [snaps] What? You hate pizza now? Or was it the song? Please say pizza 'cause I feel like that jam really worked.
It's your tia Ophelia.
We danced all night at Elena's quinces.
She had scarlet fever as a child and lost her right eye.
Ooh, there is a tia Diabla? [scoffs] Sounds hot.
She's Abuelita's little sister, Mirtha.
A mantilla is a lace veil that's passed on from bride to brideÂ in our family, and you stitch the couple's name into it.
It's a Spanish tradition.
You have to hate my sister.
I am sick of this old-lady beef.
You know what, Mami? If you don't settle this feud, I'll tell the whole family you had a stroke.
[gasps] Then they will think I'm old.
Yeah.
I need to hide.
She shares a one-bedroom apartment with her long-time roommate, Susan.
How is that gay? Okay.
Someone in this family needs to accept her.
And I can shepherd her out of the closet and into the light.
[sighs deeply] So I'll get you the goss.
Or chisme as we fluents call it.
Mami, you said you were going to apologize.
Okay.
I tried the Brazilian Blowout in '07.
Did not like the upkeep.
She's fixing everything right now, and we're going to be able to hang out just like old times.
[sighs deeply] If she gets close to the coffin again, I'll push her in! - Really? - No.
This will all be over soon.
Yeah, I don't like that.
I started a GSA, a gay-straight alliance, because no one should ever feel ashamed of who they are which is gay.
That's great,Â mija.
[knocks coffin] Papito.
There's too many people around.
[gasps] Thief.
[gasps] Ophelia had the mantilla all this time? Ha! It makes sense.
In '07, I also got a Brazilian down there.
Never again.
Oh, yeah.
Did you get any chismes? No.
Is it weird we are dancing at a funeral? It's a Latino funeral.
It'd be weird if we weren't dancing.
I had some really rough nights when I'd be under the covers, crying, and I would just take out one of your letters, start reading it, and it would feel like you were right there next to me, making me laugh and telling me that everything was gonna be okay.
Wow.
Mimi told me that she had a mole removed that looked like a Tic-Tac.
Now look at her go.
And now I would like to honor Ophelia with a song.
Ave MariaÂ  Dumb payasa.
Come on out, sister.
I'm Jewish.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
And, honestly, I don't care.
I know that they love me.
Susan and I are just going on vacation to Busch Gardens.
Yeah, you are.
Does it? What does that mean? Well, Elena is, you know Excuse me? Because your son Flavio is Seriously, this whole apartment is yellow? Somebody give tia Divorce a color wheel.
Hand over the mantilla, Penelope.
- I had a stroke! - What? I got it! AsÃ­! Oh, oh, oh.
I am sorry.
So who has the real mantilla? Well, La Diabla obviously.
Mentirosa! You have it.
That was a wedding? [mumbles] I just thought it was a very affectionate barbecue.
Oh, my God! So, we've been fighting for over 20 years about nothing.
- [gasps] - I know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Okay? - Familia para siempre.
- [all] SÃ­.
[fighting video game sounds on TV] Wow.
Another Saturday on the couch.
I'm partial to - my everything.
- I like it.
" But it's my duty as an ally.
You can't call yourself an ally.
And "girlfriend" is Chloe's preferred term, so don't even.
Wha-wha-what? Chloe? Do tell! I haven't seen anything about a girlfriend on his Instagram.
- Well, do you have a Finsta? - Of course.
But it's just me cosplaying Wynonna Earp.
This house is a dictatorship.
I need to know where you are, who you're with, and what you thinking.
I didn't even find out till I got the bill.
Big wedding.
- [phone dings] - New post.
Him and Chloe at the museum, perfectly fine.
Your loss.
I'll try to survive without you telling me my "melons" are in season.
I would hate to be a teenage boy in today's dating world.
"Hi, would you like to go to the prom? I'm suing you! Hashtag MeToo.
It's so confusing out there.
Is it? I mean what do I say? Don't be creepy, don't be douchey, don't be Scott.
" But when the next woman walked by, what came out was, "Yum yum, give me some.
" You were just an awkward teenager.
[phone dings] Now he's posing with Chloe and honking her boob.
Ha! Like it's a horn.
At lunch time I was bummed 'cause I wasn't super excited about my turkey sandwich.
But then I had one of those mini Snickers? Surprisingly satisfying.
This right here, this is that straight-up teenage boy garbage, where they think everything stupid and gross is hilarious.
It's not hilarious, it's sleazy, and I refuse to be the mother of a sleaze.
What? Yeah, uh, sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Look, it's just dumb stuff that makes my friends laugh, and gets me 320 likes.
Do I wanna hear the rest of the story? Pobrecito Papito.
He was so sad because he asked Chloe out and she said no.
Oh, please, I do not enable toxic men.
I clean Papito's room twice a day.
Oh, yes.
Much more than all the other women.
" Do I wanna hear the rest of this story? And the next thing Mimi knew, she was afraid and barefoot, standing in the middle of a sugarcane field.
Oh, my god! I know, bare feet.
Okay.
Alex, here's the thing about women.
It has to be an enthusiastic yes.
A "hell yes!" Oh, I've never gotten one of those.
So you didn't know if you had their consent.
We were just demonstrating the ideal.
" What's that? Unsurprising.
How many women have said, "Eh, fine"? Yeah, I got to make some calls.
"Girls, don't dress provocatively.
Girls, don't walk alone.
Good, call me crazy for defending a woman's right not to be groped! You're mad 'cause the internet told you to be.
You don't know my life, or even leave this apartment! Because of guys like you! What are you talking about? [scoffs] You want to know? Okay.
It was terrifying.
And then we finally lost them in a crowd and ran home.
I will do it! Both of you, please cool it with the toxic masculinity.
The worst part is, I didn't stand up to those guys.
Then one night, I was finishing up paperwork when he walks in with a bottle of whiskey.
And right away, in my gut, I knew that something was wrong.
I'm reactive.
So I screamed and I kicked him in the balls.
He also said that I might be transferred and I didn't want to get transferred.
I freaking loved that job and I was good at it.
Well, it's all super depressing, Mom.
But the good news is is that the future is bright because of strong, amazing, young people like you, who aren't taking any crap.
Sorry for saying dumbass.
I would have said worse.
And 1,000 percent disappointing.
I just spent 12 hours listening to women tell me all my flaws.
Who could understand her? I am fluent in mambo, not mumbo jumbo.
Well, as a future nurse practitioner, let me explain her diagnosis.
That I can do.
Papito, hit it.
Ooh A gift certificate for vaginal rejuvenation? Where do we put this? Front and center so we can see who bids on it.
Hey, I just realized it's our anniversary.
[both] Woo-woo! Okay, I'm just gonna keep on going.
So I was thinking that if everyone grabbed a couple baskets, we could be done in like ten minutes.
No.
[in Spanish] It's a miracle she didn't send a maid.
Oh, fantastic.
Now I can have a mojito while I bathe.
I'm terrible.
" You got to see him do it.
I hear you, and yes, I will be your wingman at the fundraiser.
Once again, I'm donating handyman for a day.
Like he's definitely been stuffed in a locker.
So what does this Mateo do? He is an accountant.
- That's right.
- Yeah, I get that when I eat soft cheese.
And I've never been so jealous in my life.
I can't find my dancing shoes.
I will admit it's kind of weird to see you without heels.
Now when you stand next Dr.
[both laugh] Lydia, I think these knitting lessons are gonna be a big hit.
They will be, because now they are dance lessons.
I already thought of that.
Put on your heels, cowboy.
Because I'll tell you, every parentÂ here is looking down the barrel of a sweet 16 party, and we wouldn't want wordÂ to get out that you don't deliver things on time.
Would we? Right.
Maybe.
Darn it, no! I love our little tradition where handyman for a day becomes handyman for a night, and then leaves right after.
Are you making fun of me? No, look, look.
[chuckles] It's a pleasure to meet you, Lorenzo.
And my ribbon is loaded with cuttlefish ink.
Cuttlefish is my favorite cephalopod ink.
Berkowitz, why are you wearing cowboy boots? There's a long-storied history of Jewish cowboys.
Yippee-ki-oy vey! Abuelita, you can't be wearing those high heels, and what happened to theÂ knitting lessons? You are putting yourself in serious danger.
Keys are jammed.
Oh.
Oh! Are you okay? All right, Abuelita, time to go.
And no needÂ to be dramatic.
Dr.
B.
[clears throat] Whoa, she wrote a lot of zeros and turned two of them in the boobs.
I, umI can't compete with that.
Us too.
In fact, we wrote you a poem.
It's crazy.
Congratulations, we did it.
We're friends.
I'd really hate to mess that up.
[sighs] Here you go, Abuelita.
This should help with the swelling.
It's not just about the shoes.
It'sonce the heels go, what's next? I don't want to put them on a shelf and remember who I was.
- I also have a really strong abuelita.
- [chuckles] And I want to keep her strong.
Mami, what happened to the motor? Oh, so tragic.
It broke when it was hit several times by a cane, which also broke.
[knock on door] Mateo? Is everything okay? - Can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure.
What's up? Earlier you asked if I wanted to go out with you and I said no.
It's been 15 years.
The thing is, when you spilled water on your It's like I saw you in a brand new way.
Chloe and her family are going on a ski trip for the break.
They're staying in a hotel room with two rooms.
I have a 1,000 words to learn! I have two words for you.
You're a dingus.
If he wants to see us, he can come here.
You know, the way he did when you were clinging to life in the hospital.
Confident, handsome, and successful? Then hashtag, no regrets.
I don't know.
- [car honks] - [scoffs] Look at this guy behind us all mad at me.
What? What, dumbass? Oh, my blinker's on.
This sucks.
Why didn't we just fly to San Diego? Your abuelita refuses to fly.
[laughs] Ay, Dios mio! Oh, really, no, I couldn't stay.
Hmm? Ah, I agree, we should redo the family portraits.
I want to do it.
But I have all the equipment.
Rush hour starts at four.
What time is it? One.
Also if anyone asks, I'm a travel agent.
[Elena vomits like a foghorn] [Elena] And the bathroom's so nice! Guys, come here, check it out.
- Mami.
- Huh? Look what I got you.
Mami, no! The weight sensor! Who do you think you're talking to? Sandbag! Abuelita, get the Bible.
Ba-bam! We'll replace it later.
LlegÃ³ la fiesta LlegÃ³ la fiestaÂ  Ha! [laughs] What are you doing here? Mami called me.
- TÃ­o! - Elena.
Elena, that is how you come out of the closet.
Tito.
He would've been there if he could.
Oye, who wants to go to the pool? I hooked us up with a cabana.
I don't want to step on your toes, or get nearÂ them, Lupita stinky feeta.
[laughs] I forgot about that one.
They're called Lemon Dopes.
That is one relaxed lemon.
Oh, my god, that sounds awful.
Just my ex is strangling me.
Ah.
I'm proud of you, Schneider.
Takes me back to Cuba.
It was on a night like this, when I debuted as a dancer, and I wore my mami's heels.
[coughs] Bite me.
Hey, hey.
" So did you freeze to death? You're welcome.
- Heard you were here.
[Lydia murmurs] You were working, far away.
Mami Well, I'm sure you had your reasons.
I'll ask the boat what its preferred pronoun is.
God, you are so insensitive.
And you're always saying that you hate my friends, and that I'm exactly like them, so I told you, I don't hate you.
I mean, sometimes I wanna kill you, but just like in the normal way.
Yeah, we do.
[both] To deal with Mom.
Okay.
And for every pic you take of me, I'll quiz you on a vocabulary word.
- What's your point? She also would've preferred to die on the floor rather than letÂ EMTs see her without lipstick.
She needed you there, and you didn't show up.
I was wrecked after Papi died.
We were all wrecked.
And next time we might not be so lucky.
We might lose her.
I love you, Lupita.
I love you too, Tito little pito.
- You know this viejita did this to us.
- [scoffs] I think she thinks you're perfect.
They never been stronger.
They go on dates.
Say what? Oye.
I'm sorry for not coming to see you when you were sick.
Y yo te, Mami.
[sniffles] Oye.
[Elena vomits like a foghorn] Me too, baby.
Shields up! Let's move that payload.
Thank you so much for the offer, but I just can't.
I'm completely swamped with disinterest.
Much safer.
Thanks.
And have you ever been molested? No.
You're welcome.
Lisa Lisa.
What are you talking about? Twenty-three, and we saw Julio Iglesias.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Schneider, I need to talk.
Sure.
He's at a concert I let him go to.
I think I made a terrible mistake.
Well, I'm glad we came.
Yeah, this place actually seems pretty safe.
Okay.
Here, I brought my binoculars.
Yeah, anyway, I don't need binoculars because I made Alex wear a long-sleeve shirt so he wouldn't catch pneumonia.
A red-and-white striped shirt.
It's a bad habit.
Oh, it's a worse habit than you think.
So aria ready for some opera? I give that pun a tenor so.
[laughs] You think I would survive this fall? These seats are awesome.
Even the opera is gay to you.
What is next? Ballet? [scoffs] You really didn't have to drag me out of that concert.
I didn't even like it.
It was stupid.
You even smell like booze.
I think.
[coughs] Ah.
Do you feel better now, Abuelita? So he shows me a drill and I say, "You better put that thing away or you're gonna need a dentist.
- Nice.
I didn't know you smoked weed.
Out like a light.
Responsibly.
I mean, a lot of vets I know were prescribed opiates and couldn't get off of them.
Yeah, it's a big problem.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little high right now.
I was understanding, but clear and firm.
One and done.
Oh, my god.
- Did you search his room? - No.
Here you go.
Fake deodorant? How did you know? You're like one of those dogs at the airport.
We used to make bongs out of maple syrup jugs.
You could walk down the street toking, people wouldn't even notice.
Am I? I kind of feel like I failed.
Look, if it helps, I know this stuff looks intense, but it's actually one of the weakest forms of marijuana.
I get it.
Then you get all paranoid.
- Yeah.
You know what else is legal? Smoking, drinking, gambling.
Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Oprah.
Unemployed, dead, and Gayle just said that to get ratings.
I tried pot a couple of times.
You did? Yeah, I was stupid too.
[scoffs] She don't know.
Luckily, there was a Latino cop working the desk who felt sorry for me and let me go, but not before he said, "You can't be doing this kind of stuff.
I would love to believe you.
But one of these days, I'm gonna make you use this.
And one more thing.
Please don't tell Abuelita what I did.
Oh, wait.
You got to keep my pot story a secret too 'cause Abuelita would never understand.
Don't answer.
Hey, so, Valentine's Day is tomorrow.
I'm taking the day for myself, and you should do all the stuff that you like to do.
Whatever that is.
- [chuckles] [together] Bye.
That was the saddest thing we have ever heard.
He is the chaperone.
Who's your date? Let's get this bocce ball rolling.
I have planned an amazing day of service.
Syd and I are doing the Heart Healthy fun run.
Everybody, huddle up.
I need advice.
Just take her to your apartment.
Then she'll know I'm rich.
[groans] What's happening? Couch nap.
[grunts] It's gonna hurt my back.
I got one of those faces.
Okay.
We can we can totally head out.
[stammering] It's just thatHmm.
I should have looked at the sky.
- Wait.
And all those hypocrites bailed, so Syd and I finished the whole thing, just to prove a point.
Yeah, you really showed them.
I see there are more than six peoples in our home.
Well, that settles it.
We'll have a fun party.
Story of my life.
- Oh.
Well, in that case, let me tell you something Mama always said.
I was just going to leave these at your door No.
Listen, don't be mad.
Barefoot on a cold floor? My TÃ­o Paco died that way.
They said it was the cancer, but we all knew.
This was years before I met the president.
Wow, that is just Can you believe this guy? I really can't.
This day gets in my head.
My wife left me on Valentine's Day.
- Mom, there's a leak! - What? All right.
Don't worry, everybody.
Can we please not? I'm so tired of looking at happy girls in tampon ads.
PMS is a thing and it's okay to feel it.
So instead, I want to find out what color makes my eyes pop.
[grunts] Great news, I made an important discovery.
That's nice.
It is your stupid hot tub! It's leaking.
I'm rich too.
But it's family money.
I just wanted you to like me.
Leak! Right.
My mom's crucifixes are a lot bloodier, but same All-Star team of Popes.
It's pretty great.
Right.
You lied to me? Why don't want Sam to come over? Does he not know we're dating? Are you embarrassed of me? It's not you.
" Oh, please.
Cubans invented it.
I can see what a great kid Alex is.
And when his grounding is up, I'd like to have him come over and hang with Sam.
And I'm sorry I wasn't more direct about what I wanted.
Mmm.
Ibailed on giving it to you 'cause I thought it was kind of corny, but Get it? It's binary code, zeros and ones, except for the heart, which is all the other numbers.
So it's a A non-binary heart! Oh, my God.
That is until we go I get it! I'll take you to Benihana.
The leak stopped.
It's nice to have so many happy couples under one roof.
Yeah.
Because it would dishonor his memory.
I understand.
[Penelope screams] I don't know how but I'm sure this is my fault.
I thought you said you fixed the hot tub! I did! Oh, my Japanese toilet! [automated voice] Arigato.
I'm just lucky Lydia came prepared.
I told you I still need tampons.
No, no.
He paid with his own $300.
Four hundred dollars a month for groceries, sixty dollars to keep the lights on, seven dollars at the Fountain Hotel.
What? That's not my charge.
Listen, I have never even been to your hotel.
It's a minibar charge? You really got the wrong girl.
Why would you need Uh I can't believe you used the minibar.
And you know, you We're going to circle back around to all of this.
That's not true.
It's fine.
She said to show me all the stupid stuff you wasted money on so that I don't end up like you.
It's a program she calls "Scared Smart".
Here's a lesson: I heard that car was suddenly going up for auction, so I had to ditch dinner plans with my favorite Uncle Gary.
He'd just had a triple bypass.
That thing travels back in time.
I could've gone back and not bid on the Ghostbusters car.
I get it.
It's great.
She is just way too young.
And how old were you? Seventeen and a half.
You're gonna go to hell.
" But I also don't want to be the mom that's like, "Use my bed.
Oh, please.
That's just a scratch.
You are such a good sonGrandson.
Listen, Mami Okay, look, you know why I'm here.
The first time I had sex, I was 17.
I thought I was ready, but I kind of had a freak out after.
And also, check your answering machine 'cause maybe he called you while you were loading up on Dollar Store tuna.
The point I'm trying to make is that sex is not a dirty thing that you should hide.
Oh, caught that one.
Can we go to your house? I'm homeschooled, and my parents are holding football tryouts for my brother.
I need to learn how to drive so we can park.
[Alex clears throat] Alex, what're you doing? Mom's in the bathroom, so she's making me stand here.
Yeezys are sneakers.
I've been saving up for months now, and if I'm not in line at the store tomorrow, they'll all be gone.
Thanks.
Now, let me tell you which sneakers to get.
[Elena clears throat] Hey there.
We would like to rent a room.
Not playing for money in a competitive Magic: The Gathering League.
We still need a credit card on file for incidentals.
Are you sure? Yeah.
Just don't touch the minibar or steal a robe.
How can I help you? Hey, bro, how are you living? Hook me up with what is good.
What do you want? - Okay, I want - Alex, what are you doing? Nothing? I want nothing.
Okay.
We are on our own.
That guy just bought the last four pairs.
[sighs] Hola.
Oh, Lydia, your soul isn't a day over 25.
Can it, Leslie! Look, I have $300.
Give her the shoes.
Yeah, give her the shoes, man! This is going viral.
Yep.
I just feel like, in the movies, they usually skip to like the end of this.
Oh! We already paid for the room.
You're gonna get some.
Wow.
I'm sorry.
Mm-hmm.
It is a big deal! What if I think I'm ready and I'm not really ready? How am I going to know because five minutes ago, I was all like, "Yeah, let's do this," and now we're in a random hotel room about to do it.
We can do it next month, next year.
We can never do it if that's what you want.
Good.
Are you okay? Well I was really wishing you were better at sneaking around like I was, so I wouldn't have to know anything about this.
[Penelope exhales] [sniffles] You really are a woman now.
Abuelita.
- No! You're watching me parallel park and screaming, "We're all gonna die!" That's teaching you to drive.
You don't even make sense half of the time.
[Lydia] It is true.
Leslie drives like an old lady.
Inadequate.
So I have updated it to the 42-point system.
Check.
- Mami.
You know that's not a legally binding document, right? So now you're going to law school, too? Come on.
You have so much time now that Leslie is teaching Elena how to drive.
I'm sure I will live forever.
I will simply write a new list.
Oh, I have lots of time.
I've already watched Netflix.
Okay, sweetie, but make sure to call if you'll be late for dinner.
It's like I don't want to know, but also I do.
Is the ropa vieja ready yet? - You taught him ropa vieja? - Yeah.
That recipe is so secret that you buy each ingredient in a different store so the cashiers can't reconstruct the recipe.
Welcome to the family.
[laughs] Ah, good job, mijo.
I am so sorry, Dr.
B.
Or worse.
You could fall into a coma, be trapped in your own mind forever.
Accelerate, brake, steer [tires squeal] avoid mailbox.
[chuckles] Look.
She could just write the recipes down, but no.
She's too afraid her 60-year-old sister will freaking Mission: Impossible into the apartment and steal them.
- I'd love to spend more time with her.
- Me too.
I thought this was a support group.
So why don't we knock it off, and why don't we start supporting? Okay? Yeah, I got nothing.
Oh, it's my daughter.
[automated voice] Hey, Leslie, I need money.
I'm sorry she only hits you up for money.
No, it's okay, Elena.
Let's just keep rocking out.
Write you a love song Come on, Dr.
- What is that? - I do not remember.
AnywayI thought staying sober these last eight years was my greatest accomplishment until today when I became an official member of this family.
Hot cakes! Am I a winner? Now, step 37.
Always be aware of your Where the hell are we? Wehave arrived at your final destination.
You want to be a good dad now.
So do it.
[phone dings] [automated voice] Incoming text message.
Leslie, is that you in front of my house? Vomit emoji.
- [laughs, exclaims] - You really mean it? - Fabuloso! [squeals] Oh, God! Like, I gotta tell you, it's really cool that you taught me this recipe.
- So thank you.
Hey! I chose to leave Victor and Max.
It wasn't because of my cooking.
It's just little tweaks.
Como how you always wear your pajamas going out of the house.
I have two healthy kids.
You are living in my house.
You are lucky that you met a guy like Papi.
I haven't yet, but that's not my fault.
Emptied his wallet.
I've never seen him so happy.
I have something for you.
Better not be neck tightening cream.
Butthat goes without saying.
[crying] No, Mami, it doesn't go without saying.
The Bible? I mean, I know your recipes have been around a long time Well, I keep them in the Bible because Mirtha cannot touch them without burning her hands.
[chuckles] [sighs deeply] Huh? - It's amazing.
 Oh, thanks, Nurse Alvarez.
But are you sure it's not appendicitis? I searched WebMD, and they said it could be all sorts of things, even cancer.
Mrs.
Homer came in with some stomach pain.
[breathes heavily] [exhales] So, I had an anxiety attack.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time So just to be clear, nobody exploded for real, right? No.
So, everybody here is familiar with anxiety attacks, right? I don't get those.
You never spiral into intense feelings of fear accompanied by palpitations and troubled breathing? Oh, yeah, I get those all the time.
Now, the judge says I gotta clean some parks.
I just put my back against the wall and try to remind myself that I am safe in my apartment.
I mean, I have these life-changing tests coming up, but I have that under control because I have to.
I've been working on itÂ for two years now, and it's all getting real real.
Okay.
[exhales] Relax.
The anxiety attacks are coming on stronger and faster.
Why don't we throw it out to the group and see how everyone copes? I'm partial to red wine and denial.
- But then - Ay, thank god! I pictured a big red stop sign, and it made me think, "Do I really want to go all Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes on her stuff?" The answer was still yes, but I didn't.
I am so glad you had a moment of clarity.
It's called a handcuff account.
[Penelope gasps] Oh, thanks.
Romantic partner? More like "I need someone to watch House Hunters with" partner.
You should all have people you can turn to in moments of emotional distress.
When I start to spiral, I text him.
He talks me through it.
Actually, I'm not.
Next stop, Yale! Okay.
[hyperventilating] Oh, God! Just Oh, God! God! Okay, just breathe.
Okay, relax.
Did you like that pug dressed as Dame Judi Dench? [laughs] Yes.
Thank you, Schneider.
Pam, we're all screwed up.
Shouldn't we be cured by now? I never said there was a cure.
We should not have let her go to sleep.
If she has a concussion, she will die.
What did you find out about the Zikas? I'm going camping.
I wonder if meditation would help yourÂ mom with her anxiety.
It's me.
I know you usually seek my counsel, but Pero today, I need a little favor from you, please.
Amen.
[all] Oh! Aw! I know.
[all laugh] All right.
Ha-ha! Hilarious.
Do they? Really? 'Cause I'm their mom.
And I don't want them worrying about things they don't need to worry about.
I really gotta pee.
My therapy session was great.
And even if you do get in, everyone will know that you don't belong.
You'll never go You'll never goÂ  You'll never ever go hereÂ  You'll never go You'll never goÂ  And they let a girl in last yearÂ  [hyperventilates] Stupid, stupid You're very stupidÂ  You're very, very, very, very stupidÂ  [Alex] Elena, are you okay? Elena? - What's going on? - I don't know.
Look.
Who fed that baby so much? Oh, I'm sorry.
Really? [sighs] You both know what anxiety and depression are, right? Well, I have that.
And I didn't want to tell you because I don't wanna freak you guys out.
Fair.
I know this is gonna sound really weird, but I'm actually happy to hear this,Â 'cause I thought that I was just going crazy.
And in the meantime, you both could meditate with me.
That always keeps me grounded.
Oh, Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
And all because he wanted to spend some time with some girl named Mary Jane.
No, it's fine, Abuelita.
I am really curious to meet your dad.
I picture the rich Monopoly guy.
That's why I poured my blood, sweat, and tears into fixing up the building.
I did all that.
[all] Oh.
This is itÂ  This is life, the one you get So go and have a ballÂ  This is itÂ  Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at allÂ  So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you doÂ  Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a timeÂ  So, up on your feetÂ  Somewhere there's music playingÂ  Don't you worry noneÂ  We'll just take it like it comesÂ  One day at a timeÂ  One day at a timeÂ  One day at a timeÂ  - One day at a timeÂ  - One day at a timeÂ  One day at a timeÂ  Papito, I am so excited.
- No.
- Oh, no, Avery's meeting us here in a minute.
Such a shame what happened.
Hi, I'm Alex.
I brought you something.
Oh! Uh, that's so thoughtful of you, sir, but I'm sober now.
- Likewise.
You know, I met your father at the Bohemian Grove a while back.
They came up and smacked me on the nalgas.
It reminded me of your abuelo.
No! Why do you think that's drug stuff? I think someone's been writing letters to a cat.
No.
[gasps] You've never said that to me before.
You deserve it, son.
He said she'd make a great first or fifth wife.
That's the highest compliment.
Everything's worth more.
Yes, property values go up for the owners, but businesses and working-class people get pushed out of their ownÂ neighborhoods because they can't affordÂ rent anymore.
But I'm glad that you and yourÂ daddy have a little project.
Why are you mad? This is gonna be great for you.
[sighs] Of course I do.
But I have to do this.
Get out.
- Penelope - No, I mean it.
Huh? What? It's my weed.
Mom found it in my room and must have left it in her pocket.
I took it off.
That's good.
Maybe we live in the car 'cause Mami is small.
And I'll just start pumping Alex with coffee now so he doesn't have another growth spurt.
We'll just keep passing on that curtain and I'll figure out a way to like cats.
[sighs] I could kill Schneider for doing this.
I slightly loosened all the sconces.
And I wrote "colonizer scum" on the wall outside! In chalk! Go wipe that off right now.
Gracias a Dios.
Papito, you should have known better.
Wait.
You got high? I got real high, baby.
We keep secrets from everyone else.
You know how we hide the good cookies in the oatmeal tin? And how you are the only person who knows I killed Elena's hermit crab with Fabuloso.
But you are growing up and it makes me a little sad.
And soon, you will not want to spend time with me.
I'm so sorry, Pen.
I don't know what to say.
Family is everything, and no one knows that more than me.
The Alvarezes are gonna be okay.
It was even higher than I thought it'd be.
Actually, Father, I've decided I'm not gonna take the building condo.
If you were a better father, you'd know that you put me through rehab five times.
And you haven't given me everything.
Oh, god! You didn't have to do that, but thank you.
Really, youyou didn't have to.
[exclaims] We're not going condo We're not going condoÂ  We're not going condo We're not goingÂ  No, no, no, we're staying! - Oh, thank god.
- Yeah.
I can go from zero to flipping this table.
Asi.
- Yeah.
So is the place.
Come in.
- Oh, okay.
It's just surprising.
You know, like, "Oh, that guy won the election? Really?" But it worked out fine.
"She, they.
" How do we keep people straight? So you wanna keep people straight? No, Elena, that's not what I meant.
What up, hombre? - Whoa.
[laughs] Hey! So, where's this girlfriend? Hey, Pen.
I'm gonna plan your bachelor party.
Hashtag Vic-turn it up.
Thank you so much for those flowers.
- Gracias, linda.
And now, you have Mateo.
Right! That guy.
I will be on bae watch.
Okay.
[sighs] It's like this.
Let's say you took in a stray dog.
I know a shady vet.
Want me to hook it up? - Ramona.
G"? Victor Alvarez Guapisimo.
Yeah, I'm not wearing a hat that says vag.
Come on.
Victor's sober.
Oh, hi.
Wow! I barely recognized you, Dr.
Hope that's okay.
Yeah, sure.
The last time I had this many shots, I slept with my weed delivery guy.
[laughs] So, later, locas.
- Right, that guy! I gotta text him back.
- [Ramona] Yeah.
[laughs] Uh Well, I know this seems fast, but Nicole is a really great person, and I would love it if you guys would get to know her.
So I hope you can spend some time with us this week.
[stammers] I'm anti-parade.
Yeah.
Uh, can we make this rum and Coke fit for a Cuban grandma? No Coke.
Good order.
Uh, but this isn't my drink.
Oh, come on.
Uh, can we call a cab for this guy? Just add it to my bill.
Bless your heart.
I told you, right? She's gorgeous.
Penelope, sit.
What did you want to tell me? [all cheering] You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
If it's any comfort, he was miserable for a really long time.
[scoffs] Till he became Mr.
Women live longer.
I'll bounce back.
- Did I miss anything? - We were talking about the wedding.
I'm available.
Okay.
And I'm definitely going to wear my white suit.
I mean, you really want me to be your best woman? II would love that.
Yes.
That's okay.
I wanted to talk to you about something, not necessarily while you smell of tequila returning from Therapy.
In fact, I don't even care.
Wow.
What's that? If anyone at school asks, I dumped you.
[laughs] [both laugh] [announcer talking on TV] - Oh.
Oh, right, that guy.
[chuckles] I gotta text him back.
Thank you.
That really means a lot to me.
Look into it.
I'm really sorry.
And he rolled down a hill into a cave of bats and lived among them for many years, and to this day, he can see in the dark.
Oh, my God.
Is there any alcohol missing? [gasps] My rum is gone.
Wait.
Did you do this move? - Yeah.
- Did you do this move? - Yeah.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna change into something a little more comfortable.
He's definitely drinking again.
Yes.
Did you really need to put that on a flashcard? I know you've never passed a test before, but this is how it's done.
Our one-year non-iversary is comin' up.
What's a non-iversary? It's one full year since your grandmother first told me that she had absolutely no romantic feelings for me.
I'm actually gonna fail.
- Elena, relax.
You mean the tiny old lady clinging to life with one hand and to our frail democracy with the other? Oh, God, she's right.
[breathes heavily] - Calm down, Doc.
Schneider's not even home, Mami.
We're just gonna go in, take a quick look around, and make sure he's not hiding anything, okay? Ah, okay.
- [gasps] - This is what Alex had.
Yes.
[plays horribly] [extends off-key note] [continues horrible playing] And not one lesson.
We thought you were at the Farmers Market.
I told you, I'm not drinking.
I went through a really hard time where I was tempted to, so you're not making things easier on me.
And the fact that you, of all people, think I'm a liar makes me feel like crap.
I'm sorry.
Uhh.
I'm so ashamed.
- Is there more booze in thisÂ apartment? - No.
- Are you lying to me? - Yes.
This pug with a wig looks just like Dame Judi Dench.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
I can.
Let's do this thing.
[chuckles] Okay, here's a picture of Abuelita's bouquet list.
Maybe you can get an idea from it.
"Kiss AndyÂ Garcia.
" "Kiss Julio Iglesias.
Great.
Because I don't care.
But Avery hasn't seen him, either.
She says they broke up.
and 11:00 p.
m.
My phone's blowing up with crying girls who didn't get their licenses.
Wait.
Thank you, Alex.
I knew you would pass.
Dude, what happened? Uh I think I ate something that didn't agree with me.
Are you drunk? What? No.
Come on! She's just gonna freak out and overreact like she did with you 'cause you smoked a little weed.
How long did she ground you for? Four months and counting.
[sighs] They say while you're staying sober, your disease is doing push-ups.
Thought I could drink like I used to, but, uh guess I'm out of practice.
- Come here.
I wanna talk to you.
I couldn't even narrow that down.
Plus Schneider.
Hey, Uber, bring the car around.
I can't drive you unless we have someone 25 or older in the car.
Seeing him again reminded me of how he always said I was bad at everything.
But it's not true.
I don't deserve to be in the Alvarez Museum anymore.
I blew it.
Eight years.
Gone.
" That's pretty smart.
Who said that? Ha ha.
[mouths] Okay, 10-minute break.
- I'm glad you're back, dude.
You're his ex-wife's landlord, and I'm his ex-mother-in-law's non-sexual, platonic companion.
We're practically family.
Calling, texting, a plane in the sky with a banner that said, "I love Avery.
Sorry, baby.
[gasps] Papito! GuapÃ­simo! You look like a movie star.
And, Elena, you look like a very important member of his entourage.
That's great.
Take your time getting ready.
I found the pumice stone.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [string quartet playing] Hey, Mami, so that girl family? Not family? Cousin's cousin.
Look how happy the kids are.
- I know.
And the seeing dead people part? Okay, that's a little weird.
But go with it.
I can't help thinking that this is unfair.
Victor gets his happy ending.
This must be killing you.
[sighs] Pobre Schneider! I know you are sad about losing your girlfriend, - but you are really pooping this party.
She's a swimsuit model.
[chuckles] Hi.
He's an excellent swimmer.
It's so obvious in retrospect.
Wow.
So, Berto's ashes was the last thing on my list.
So many things have changed.
I have a mustache now.
He seems great.
We do make a nice picture.
Um, nope.
So boring! We're still buddies, though.
[crowd applauds] - You got this.
- Thank you.
[crowd applauds] Oh, you'll find someone.
[wedding party member] Whether she's teaching special ed or Nice work.
And, you know, her.
It'll be good for you to get it out.
That doesn't erase all the bad stuff that happened, and everything's not okay yet.
And today, it was me making sure everybody was comfortable, and me saying nice things about you, and me showing up for you onÂ your big day when you didn't show up for me on mine.
Thank goodness we found face painter at the bar mitzvah next door.
Thank you, Cookie the kosher clown.
And I was particularly terrible to my daughter when she was coming out.
So, in front of family and friends Elena if you would be so kind as to give your papi another shot.
This goes out to Lydia from her longtime, non-sexual, platonic companion.
The Chicken Dance! A chicken dance? It's on your bouquet list.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I'm sorry.
How are you here? Lydia called.
She said you should never give up on an Alvarez.
Thirty-seven days without youwas hell.
I'm so glad you're here.
So, everybody, find that special someone and get on the dance floor.
[soft song playing] [sighs] Papi, this one hurts.
So you seeing anyone? Is he here? I'mover you but also super-jealous.
No, I am not seeing anyone, which has made today extra interesting.
I'm not a betting man, but if I had to bet on anyone it'd be you.
Thank you.
Don't you want a man who can make you happy? Everyone keeps telling me I'll be happy when I find someone.
But I'm already happy.
[all cheer] Dale, Lupita, dale Dale, Lupita, dale [all cheer] Dale, Lupita, dale [inhales] [exhales] [phone rings] Hello? [Lydia] Hello.
