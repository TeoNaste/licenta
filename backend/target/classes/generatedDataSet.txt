[light chime music] [sighs] [door clicks open] Eleanor? Come on in.
Hi, Eleanor.
I'm Michael.
How are you today? I'm great.
Thanks for asking.
Oh, one question.
Where am I? Who are you? And what's going on? Right, so, you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Cool.
I have some questions.
Thought you might.
[chuckles] How did I die? I-I don't remember.
Yes, um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths, we erase the memory to allow for a peaceful transition.
Are you sure you want to hear? All right, so you were in a grocery store parking lot.
You dropped a bottle of something called "Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One.
" And when you bent down to pick it up, a long column of shopping carts that were being returned to the shopping cart collection area rolled out of control and plowed right into you.
You were able to grab on to the front of the column of shopping carts, but it swept you right out into the street where you were struck and killed by a mobile billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction pill called "Engorge-ulate.
" Funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive was an ex-boyfriend of yours Okay, that's I get it, thank you.
Oh, okay, sorry.
Um, so who was right? I mean about all of this? Well, let's see.
Hindus are a little bit right, Muslims a little bit.
Jews, Christians, Buddhists, every religion guessed about 5%, except for Doug Forcett.
Who who's Doug Forcett? Well, Doug was a stoner kid who lived in Calgary during the 1970s.
One night, he got really high on mushrooms, and his best friend, Randy, said, "Hey, what do you think happens after we die?" And Doug just launched into this long monologue where he got like 92% correct.
He's pretty famous around here.
I'm very lucky to have that.
- So - [chuckles] Maybe my biggest question: am I I mean, is this Or Well, it's not the heaven or hell idea that you were raised on.
But generally speaking, in the afterlife, there's a Good Place and there's a Bad Place.
You're in the Good Place.
- [exhales sharply] - You're okay, Eleanor.
You're in the Good Place.
Well, that's good.
Okay.
So this is how it works.
The Good Place is divided into distinct neighborhoods.
Each one contains exactly 322 people who have been perfectly selected to blend together into a blissful harmonic balance.
Do all the neighborhoods look like this? No, every neighborhood is unique.
Some have warm weather, some cold.
Some are cities, some farmland.
But in each one, every blade of grass, every ladybug, every detail has been precisely designed and calibrated for its residents.
[sighs] That's the one thing we put in all the neighborhoods.
People love frozen yogurt.
I don't know what to tell you.
You're gonna have a million more questions, I know.
For right now, better grab a seat.
Movie's about to begin.
[indistinct chatter] - Ah.
[chuckles] Hello, everyone.
But how do we know that you were good? How are we sure? - During your time on Earth, - every one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe.
- Every sandwich you ate, - - every time you bought a magazine, - every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad.
You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic? And they think to themselves, "Ah, who cares? No one's watching.
" We were watching.
Surprise.
[laughter] Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system.
Only the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to the Good Place.
What happens to everyone else, you ask? Don't worry about it.
Your true soul mate is here too.
- [crowd gasps and murmurs] - That's right.
Soul mates are real.
One of the other people in your neighborhood is your actual soul mate, and you will spend eternity together.
So welcome to eternal happiness.
Welcome to the Good Place.
Sponsored by: otters holding hands while they sleep.
You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands? That's how you're gonna feel every day.
president except Lincoln.
That sounds about right.
What about Florence Nightingale? That was close, but, no, she didn't make it.
Wow, all those amazing people down there, it just seems so hard to believe.
Again, it's an incredibly selective system.
Most people don't make it here.
But you, a lawyer who got innocent people off death row, you're special, Eleanor.
And by the way, welcome to your new home.
So I guess that's why my house, for example, is this adorable little cottage, whereas other people might have homes that are bigger, like that one.
Exactly.
Oh, I'm so happy you get it.
As you can see, the interior has been decorated just as you like it, in the Icelandic primitive style.
Oh, oh, and, uh, of course, you love clowns, so I do love clowns.
Now, let me show you the, uh the video system here.
[shimmering tone] You can review everything that happened in your life from your point of view.
There we go.
It really put you over the top.
Oh.
Chidi, come on in.
Eleanor? I'm Chidi Anagonye, and you are my soul mate.
Cool, bring it in, man.
Now, excuse me.
I have other people to attend to.
So where you from, Chidi? Well, I was born in Nigeria, raised in Senegal, but my work took me all over the place Australia, Hong Kong, Paris.
- Arizona.
And then I went to school in Tempe, Arizona.
And then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona.
Your English is amazing.
Oh! I'm actually speaking French.
This place just translates whatever you say into a language the other person can understand.
- So it's incredible.
- Whoa.
Eleanor.
I have spent my entire life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe.
And now we can actually learn about them together as soul mates.
It's overwhelming.
Chidi.
You'll stand by my side no matter what, right? Of course I will.
Promise me.
Say, "I promise I will never betray you for any reason.
Because those aren't my memories.
I wasn't a lawyer.
I never went to the Ukraine.
I hate clowns.
There's been a big mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Wait, what? [light instrumental music] [children chattering] Are you sure this isn't you? Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure I wasn't a death row lawyer who collected clown paintings and rescued orphans.
They got my name right, but nothing else.
Why can't I say "fork"? If you're trying to curse, you can't here.
I guess a lot of people in this neighborhood don't like it, so it's prohibited.
That's bullshirt.
So, uh, if you're not this person, then who are you? What did you do for a living? I was in sales.
So we sell two products here, NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver.
We aim this at seniors.
Now, you can't legally call it medicine because it doesn't technically work and it is technically chalk, so what you're gonna want to do You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine.
I get it, man.
Okay, but that's worse.
I mean, you you do get how that's worse? - Right? - Mm.
[indistinct chatter] You know, maybe it's a test.
Maybe if you go to Michael and you tell him the truth, you'll pass the test and you'll get to stay.
No way.
I can't risk going to the Bad Place.
Okay, well, maybe it's not actually, like, all that bad.
Let's just get some information first.
- Gah! How can I help you? What the fork? Who are you? I'm Janet.
I'm the informational assistant here in the Good Place.
She's like this walking database.
You can ask her about the creation of the universe or history Oh, there was a guy who lived in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002.
His name was Kevin Paltonic.
- Is he gay? - No.
Really? Huh.
I guess he just didn't want to have sex with me.
- Yes, you were.
- Okay, Janet, - I have a question.
- Okay.
What is the Bad Place like? Oh, sorry, that is the one topic I'm not allowed to tell you about.
I can only play you a brief audio clip of what is happening there right now.
Okay.
[people yelling and screaming, mechanical buzzing] - The bear has two mouths! - [people screaming] [sound stops] Well, it doesn't sound awesome.
[scoffs] Does everyone have a huge house except me? All right, we need a plan.
I just don't like being dishonest, and I can't advise you to be dishonest either.
Come on, I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit.
You must've told a few white lies in your life.
I mean, what was your job? I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
Motherforker! I'm getting a stomachache.
I'm in a perfect utopia, and I'm I have a stomachache.
This is awful.
I-I, uh I think I have to tell Michael about this.
They are soul mates and your next-door neighbors.
Hello.
Can I just say I love your house? It's just so tiny and cute.
It's like a little child's plaything, like for a family of mice or for a very fancy little dog.
I love it.
It's just so sweet and teensy.
Just like you.
Boop.
You booped me.
Ha-ha.
- I did.
- That's fun.
Tahani and Jianyu are having a little welcome party tonight, and they've invited the entire neighborhood.
- [squeaks] - I simply adore entertaining.
Don't I just adore it, Jianyu? Oh, um, yes, by the way, Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see? And he obeys a strict code of silence.
So when you see him smiling and nodding, that's actually his way of jumping up and down with glee.
[indistinct chatter] - [scoffs] - No way.
[indistinct chatter] My entire house could fit in this room.
Okay, uh help me out here.
Tell me one good thing that you did on Earth, just one truly kind and decent act so that I can feel better about helping you out.
Let's forget about good.
Um, just tell me something neutral about yourself.
Like, tell me about the day before you died.
What do you remember? Hi there.
I don't remember anything specific.
- Oh.
- Look.
I might not have been a saint, but it's not like I killed anybody.
I wasn't an arsonist.
I never found a wallet outside of an IHOP and thought about returning it but saw the owner lived out of state so just took the cash and dropped the wallet back on the ground.
Okay, that's really specific, and that makes me think that you definitely did do that.
All I'm saying is these people might be "good," but are they really that much better than me? Well, I spent half my life in North Korea fighting for women's rights and the other half in Saudi Arabia fighting for gay rights.
won't remove those land mines, we will.
" And we dug up over a thousand unexploded land mines from the area surrounding the orphanage.
Well, then he said, "You can't give me both your kidneys; you'll die.
" And I said, "But you will live.
" And I know we just met on this bus ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice.
[groans] Oh, forget it.
Heading to the bar! [glass clinking] [polite applause] Thank you, thank you.
You all know that I am the architect of this neighborhood.
- [murmurs and applause] - Yes! [laughs] Ah, gah-gah gah-gah-gah.
Hold on there, ace.
Let me get more of them shrampies.
- Okay, easy.
- What? They're for everybody, right? Yes, exactly.
And you deserve a perfect world because every single one of you is a good person.
That's it for me.
Back to you, Tahani.
Such fun.
Cheers.
[laughs] [applause] Tahani, what a condescending bench.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Am I right? Why does she still have that British accent, right? No one else here has an accent.
She's choosing to have that accent.
- Shh-shh-shh-shh.
- [stodgily] "Oh, hello.
Okay.
- I think it's time to go home.
- [laughing mockingly] Wait, wait, wait.
I just have to go upstairs real quick and steal a bunch of gold stuff.
Okay, don't do that.
Don't do no, Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor.
[light instrumental music] Hello, creepy house that I hate.
Hello, one million clowns.
[hiccups] Yes.
Whatever, it's freakin' heaven.
I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.
That Tahani is a real butthead, huh? [gasps] Hey.
At least I can still say "butthead.
" [groans] She is a butthead.
Found some pajamas.
Chidi Chidi, Chidi? I'm sorry that you had to deal with this It's okay.
I don't know.
I was an only child.
My parents were divorced when I was a kid.
They were both crummy people, so they're probably [imitates fart] in the Bad Place.
Maybe they're being used to torture each other.
It would work.
[chuckles] I bet way more people cared that you died.
'Cause you're a nice person.
Aganocomonga.
Anagonye.
- Ags say it again.
- Anagonye.
No, say what you said before.
I did.
It's Anagonye.
You just changed it.
Ariana Grande.
[gasps] That's a person.
I did it.
Good night.
Good night.
[button clicks] [playful music] [people cheer] [playful musical flourish] Well, that's terrifying.
[snoring] [thunder crashes, birds cawing] [thunder crashing] That can't be good.
[pop music] I'm stronger than I've been before This is the part When I break free 'Cause I can't resist it no more Oh, fork.
No.
No, it's not.
I have no idea why any of this is happening or how to control it.
Should we run away then? Yes.
It was lethal - Righto.
- It was fatal In my dreams, it just felt so right But I woke up every time Ooh, baby This is the part When I say I don't want ya I'm stronger than I've been before Chidi, Chidi! What's going on? Why are there giant animals everywhere? Do you hear Ariana Grande playing? Why is everyone wearing blue and yellow? You're not.
You're you're the only one who's not.
Eleanor, this is all happening because of you.
We don't know this is because of me.
Eleanor, this place is a perfectly made Swiss watch, and you are a wrench in the gears.
Actually, you're a hammer, just smashing the gears into dust.
Oh, hang on.
Not everybody here is perfect, okay? Tahani is totally condescending.
And there are a couple of, you know, chunksters.
Oh, come on! No judgment.
I'm just saying I'm not the only one with flaws.
Okay, fine, turns out there are many ways to know that it was me.
Let's just face it, Eleanor, you don't belong here.
Well, then this system sucks.
What, one in a million gets to live in paradise and everyone else is tortured for eternity? Come on.
I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi, but I was okay.
I was a medium person.
I should get to spend eternity in a medium place! Like Cincinnati.
Everyone who wasn't perfect but wasn't terrible should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati.
Unless there is something we can do.
Unless you could teach me.
Teach you what? How to be good.
That was your job, right? A professor of ethics? No one knew I was a problem when I arrived.
Things only started getting crazy after I was an ash-hole to everyone at the party.
[groans] You know I'm trying to say "ash-hole" and not "ash-hole," right? I got that, yes.
Okay, give me a chance.
Let me earn my place here.
My soul is in your hands, soul mate.
What's it gonna be? [knock at door] [thunder crashes] Oh, stomachache.
[mid-tempo music] I, uh I don't know what to do here.
This is a mess, morally speaking.
This is a putrid, disgusting bowl of ethical soup.
Okay, well how about we just chill and go to the town meeting and talk it out after? - W - Great.
Hey, how do I make that helper woman show up? Hello? Front desk lady? Magical slave robot? Excuse me, Janet? - Hi there.
- [gasps] Gah still not used to it.
Now, what kind of pornography would you like to see? No.
No, no, no, not porn.
I, um I need clothes like yours and Chidi's with the stripes.
There you go.
[indistinct chatter] [claps] Everybody, everybody! Uh, gather round, please, thank you, thank you.
Obviously, there's something very wrong with this neighborhood.
We don't know what it is, how long it will last, or what caused it.
What do we know, Janet? We know where it happened.
The chaos happened here.
See, that's the trouble with these perfect systems.
One little flaw can lead to well, it can lead to Gary over there.
[indistinct murmuring] Hey, Gary.
Hang in there, buddy.
Boy, my armpits are leaking.
What is that called again? - Sweat.
- Right, right.
Oh, right.
And then you lick the cloth? That seems weirder.
Michael.
Look! Okay.
That's a good sign.
It it could mean that this is almost over.
Oh, such a relief.
That was my first time as a fashion "don't," and I did not care for it.
And you chose a chalkboard? What are you reading? "The Metaphysics of Morals" by Immanuel Kant.
It's a treatise on the aesthetic preconditions of the mind's receptivity to duty.
A book on how to act good.
Oh, great! So you've decided to help me? I don't know.
There's a thousand questions.
Is there a moral imperative to help you? Do I have a greater obligation to my community? Are you taking someone else's spot, someone who deserves to be here? Ooh, on that question, I honestly think I was just put here by mistake.
Because Michael called me Eleanor Shellstrop, so he knows I'm me.
He's just wrong about my overall "quality" level.
Tell me one fact that you know about me.
I mean, we spent the whole day together.
You must remember something.
What country am I from? [groans] Is it racist if I say Africa? Yes, and Africa is not a country.
I am from Senegal.
Do I have any siblings? Where did I go to college? Trick question.
You didn't.
I was literally a college professor.
You were born in Phoenix.
You went to school in Tempe.
You're an only child.
Your favorite show is something called "The Real Housewives of Atlanta," and your favorite book is Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
How did you know all that? Because you are constantly talking about yourself.
You are the most self-obsessed person I have ever met.
You should see Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
Okay, this is my fear about you, Eleanor.
What country am I from, again? Sen sodyne.
That is a brand of toothpaste.
Look, the only thing that you are concerned with is your own happiness.
That's your problem.
[scoffs] Okay, names in the hat.
Time to pick a designated driver.
And the loser is Betsy.
Wait, you never get picked, and you're always the one who draws the name.
Everyone here believes in my integrity 100%, right, guys? Give it to me.
For the record, I did that out of principle, because it absolutely had your name on it.
If I check the other ones, I can figure it out by process of elimination.
[indistinct chatter] All right, everyone, let's get started.
Things have settled down.
Whew! [chuckles] So hopefully, we're off and running.
Welcome to orientation, day two.
Now, today we're gonna start with something that everyone has always wanted to do.
Uh, Michael? If if I might? I was just thinking, earlier today in all of the chaos, large swaths of this neighborhood were destroyed.
We thought perhaps some of us could, uh, volunteer to help clean up the debris.
You know, it's quite a fun way to band together as a community, isn't that right, Jianyu? Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.
For those of you who don't know, my soul mate, Jianyu here, is a Buddhist monk.
He took a vow of silence that he's still observing, even here, in the Good Place.
It's truly inspiring.
Well, Tahani, it's not really your job to clean up, but I suppose there's no harm if you really want to.
Oh, well, hurrah.
[chuckles] Have fun, nerds.
I'll be soaring through the air like a forkin' bird.
Eleanor and I would love to help.
Ah, hurrah-hurrah, yay.
Dude.
You want to prove you're not selfish? Here's the perfect test.
There's something fun that you want to do, and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good.
Which do you choose? Have fun.
- Great! Whee! You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana.
Doesn't really matter of what she's a princess of.
It's not really important.
Tahani! How goes the cleaning? Oh, swimmingly, Michael.
And I have to say this neighborhood that you've built is truly a masterpiece, the likes of which I've never seen.
And I've been to Johnny Depp's private bird sanctuary.
Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.
See, I must have made a mistake somewhere.
[sniffs] And it led to all this chaos, and now I'm just I'm just terrified that it's gonna happen again.
I'm trying to put a good face on well, this this face that I've constructed for myself.
But the truth is, I I'm just miserable.
[sniffs] I have to go.
Thank you so much for your service.
Oh, no.
Powerful people do not handle failure well.
One, two, three.
We must help Michael.
Oh, you sly devil.
You're going to keep me on my toes, aren't you? All right, come on.
Let's go.
[giggling] - Oh.
- Ooh.
Hey, Gunnar! Hey, Antonio! Hey, Eleanor.
Us too! [laughter] You guys are so fun.
Just relentlessly fun.
I keep thinking, "When are they gonna stop being fun?" And the answer is never.
- You're never gonna stop.
- [both giggling] Well, I have had a pretty full day of being unselfish.
I've made some new friends.
My area's almost garbage-free.
So you're gonna help me figure out how to stay, right? Well, that is a really tough question.
He he compared it to playing the flute.
The more you practice, the more you improve.
Aristotle! That's my boy, right there.
He was the best.
I mean, most people agree he was the best one.
So it sounds to me like you are on board the "help Eleanor" train.
Well, I've narrowed it down to two possibilities: yes and no.
Well, no worries.
[exhales] Hey, guys.
Okay, Eleanor, reminder.
We switched to a rotating system for choosing a designated driver, and it's your turn.
Got it.
Full disclosure, I forgot we were doing this new system.
I got off work early.
I've been here for about an hour, and I'm already pretty drunk.
Someone else will do it.
Beep! Beep! [laughs] [slurping] Whoo! - Whoa! - [people cheering] I can't believe they've managed to mix one million flavors together, and yet, somehow, I can taste each individual one.
It's remarkable.
I got no-flavor.
- It's all I deserve, really.
- No.
Look, I I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
I really do, but you don't understand.
This was the very first neighborhood that I got to design.
Oh, Tahani, if I made one tiny mistake in my design, if there's a single glitch in the system, if even one blade of grass is angled a a fraction of a degree off [dog whimpers] The whole neighborhood is compromised.
Whose dog is that? Guys, whose dog is that? Whose dog is that? See, this is one of those glitches I was talking about.
Nice try, puppy! [dog whimpering] [dog whimpers, pop] Whew! [chuckles] That was a close one.
Teacup? Hey, have you seen my dog? [grunts] Shouldn't these be magical trash bags? Five more minutes, flyers! Five more minutes! Oh, man, really? [bright instrumental music] Janet, I'm finished with cleanup, and I'm ready to fly.
- How do I start? - Hop on the launch pad and conjure an image that brings you pure joy.
Some people think of their wedding day or favorite vacation spot.
People puking on roller coasters.
People puking on roller coasters.
But I got her back.
- [dog whimpers and growls] - Everything everything seems fine.
Teacup, thank goodness you're okay.
Everyone, it is merely a construct of a dog.
It feels no pain or joy or love.
Teacup doesn't love me? Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it definitely feels love.
Do you actually want a dog that loves you a little bit more? Because I can kick her right back into the sun and get you another one just like that.
- No! - Oh, boy.
Breathe.
Breathe do you breathe? - Mm-hmm.
- If you do, then just breathe 'cause everything's fine, Michael, it's fine.
Ooh! [wind whistling] It's raining garbage.
Run! Ooh, ooh, no, no, no, I'm gonna run this way.
[garbage clattering] Chidi! Hey.
Before you say anything That's it, I just don't want you to say anything.
- What did you do? - Nothing! It just started raining trash out of nowhere for no reason at all.
But in my defense, there were only five minutes left in flying and I wanted to go flying.
How is that a defense? You made a bad choice.
I made a bad choice? We could have literally been flying, and all you wanted to do was talk about morals.
I mean, you're like the worst part of Superman.
This is a relief.
I can stop my deliberations.
You're a selfish person, and it is pointless to help you.
You are on your own.
It's a it's a dream come true.
[gasps] [both exhale] We're okay! You can't die here.
Come on, I mean, even you have to admit, those guys are psycho.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I mean, it's my duty to be calm and in control and I'm falling apart.
No, Michael, you are a paragon of fortitude.
You're a mountain of strength.
I'm not a mountain of strength.
Surely now, you will say something? Grace us with your vocalized wisdom.
Please, I'm begging you.
[gentle piano music] Oh.
Yes, yes, I understand.
The strength is inside me.
It's been there all along.
No, of course, I can overcome any obstacle.
Oh, thank you, Jianyu, thank you.
Oh, you have so much to teach me.
Maybe I should try to be silent too.
No really, look.
Here I go.
Oh! That was wonderful! So cleansing.
[eerie music] [laughter] Just water tonight, huh? Designated driver? Yeah, it sucks.
I think it's awesome.
I mean, someone's got to do it, right? I think it's a cool thing to do for people.
Staying sober and knowing my friends will get home safe, that's my buzz.
Hey, guys, good news and bad news.
See that hot bartender over there? He's into me, and we're gonna bang it out.
The bad news is, it means I can't drive you guys home.
But I did call a cab for you guys.
But they recognized my number, and they didn't want to come.
I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.
So are we good here? Eleanor, you have a very important choice to make.
I'll see you guys at work.
Peace! You, let's go.
[sighs] Hey.
How did you know I was here? I saw you from my window.
That's where I live, by the way.
Not that you ever asked.
What are you doing? I went to all the places where I dumped trash earlier and cleaned it up so it couldn't be traced back to me.
Well, it looks like you cleaned up everything.
Okay, yeah, fine, I felt bad for stupid Gunnar and stupider Antonio and the whole neighborhood.
I felt bad about what I did.
It was a weird feeling.
Not used to it.
Didn't love it.
Well, feeling remorse about being wrong isn't as good as just doing something right, but it's a start.
Look, I think you're capable of change.
And I will help you try.
I've collected the worst-smelling garbage that I could find.
Do you still want me to dump it inside of Antonio's house? What? No.
I did not tell you to do that.
You are loco, girlfriend.
Okay, I won't let you down starting now.
[chuckling] Ah, Eleanor.
- Good morning.
- Michael.
I was very proud of that.
One of the hardest problems I had to solve.
Eleanor, I know what you did.
Cleaning up the entire neighborhood by yourself.
[laughs] I knew you were special, but this is proof.
Enjoy your coffee.
And the cup.
Okay, let's begin your "good person" lessons.
We're gonna have assignments and quizzes and papers.
It's gonna be so much fun.
Remind me what I'm getting out of this again.
You get to avoid eternal damnation.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Hey, I got you a present.
What? Senegal.
Good talk.
[tense music] Ah, shirt.
So Aristotle was Plato's student.
And Aristotle believes that your character - is voluntary, - because it's just the result of your actions, which are under your control.
For example, right now, you have made the insane choice to ignore the person who is literally trying to save you from eternal damnation.
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm listening.
Uh, I just are we sure we should be paying attention to these guys? It's like, who died and left Aristotle in charge of ethics? Plato.
[knock at door] Uh, coming! Uh, we're just kissing.
Hi.
What brings you here? You know, I was just, uh, in the neighborhood.
[giggles] Do you get it, Eleanor? Because, you know, we're all in the same afterlife, so, you know, I'm always in the neighborhood.
Do you get it? And I do, and it's delightful.
Anyway, this is for you.
Just a housewarming plant.
It's a little reminder that if there's ever anything that you need, I am right next door.
How could I possibly forget? Have a great day, Tahani! Oh, all right.
[British accent] Welcome to the neighborhood.
Even though we all arrived here at the same time, here's some dirt I put in a bowl because I'm amazing.
I thought it was kind of a nice gesture.
Oh, Chidi.
It's a total con.
I see through her little act.
Her act of being a nice person who brings you gifts? - Bingo.
- Okay.
Oh, so now I'm supposed to be nice and make friends - and treat her with mutual respect? - Yeah.
That exactly what she wants me to do, Chidi, wake up! That that's what everyone wants everyone to do.
Hello, Chidi.
No frozen yogurt for you this morning? Oh, uh, no, just, uh, doing some reading.
Ugh, been there, brother.
Workin' hard or hardly workin', am I right? Hump day.
Uh, sorry.
Janet's functioning as my assistant, but she's a little stiff, so I've been trying to get her to be a little more casual and conversational.
Listen, Chidi.
I've been studying your file.
You're a very interesting case.
You essentially only did one thing while you were on earth.
You thought and wrote about ethics.
Yes, I spent 18 years working on my manuscript called "Who We Are and Who We Are Not colon "Practical Ethics and Their application.Application in the Modern World semi-colon a Treatise" Yes, yes, yes, that's the one.
That's the one.
I think you should experience new adventures.
Not if I see you first.
Where's the beef? [chuckles] - I don't know.
- Hump day.
[knocking] Hello, Eleanor.
Jianyu, darling, look, it's Eleanor from next door.
Is he asleep? Yeah, there's really no way to tell.
Come on in.
What brings you to our home, my dear? Well, I'm simply repaying your kind gift with a housewarming gift of my own.
So maybe it's a better gift.
- Who's to say? - That's so kind.
However, in, um, Chinese culture, pears are actually a symbol of bad luck.
And and I wouldn't want to offend Jianyu, so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to throw these in the garbage.
But do come and sit down.
We haven't even had a chance to discuss all of the mayhem in our neighborhood yet.
- It's so disconcerting.
- Yes.
In fact, tomorrow I'm actually going door-to-door to make sure that every single person in this entire neighborhood is keeping calm and carrying on.
'Cause I think that helping others will make me feel like I truly belong here, you know? Here's a brainstorm, why don't I go with you? I mean, I would love to do my part to help the neighborhood, not to mention, get a little bonding time with you, lady.
Oh, hurrah! Such fun.
I'm telling you, Tahani's out to get me.
What are you talking about? This note was slipped under my door yesterday.
It has to be Tahani.
She just said to me, "I want to feel like I truly belong here.
" Well, where have I seen the word "belong" recently? Oh yeah, kaplow! I really don't think she's the type of person who would write this.
And kind of turned on.
The point is, she straight up sucks, bro.
[chiming] - Whoa.
- Typical Tahani.
Brings us a faulty plant so she can brag about being a better gardener.
No, I think this is another way in which your negative actions affect this world.
This plant represents your relationship to Tahani, so when you're mean to her, it starts to wilt.
Well, then this plant is doomed, because tomorrow, I'm going with her and I'm gonna prove to you and to everyone that she is secretly a two-faced, calculating, phony bench.
Truth hurts, doesn't it, plant? So all I want to do is just check in, see how everyone's holding up.
Just bring some cheer to these extraordinary people.
Cool.
So tell me about yourself.
I mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend.
The good, the bad, the really bad, the embarrassing, the humiliating, just let's bond! Okay, well I was born in Pakistan, raised in London, schooled in Paris, but I think the primary reason that I'm in the Good Place is that I raised quite a lot of money for non-profit groups.
Oh.
Did you ever, uh, skim a little off the top for yourself? Gracious, no, no! Every penny was accounted for.
I was a model, a museum curator, an "It Girl," and oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse for a while.
That was quite fun.
Modeling? That's a crazy life.
Want to tell me about that rock bottom you probably hit? Oh, I didn't really do it for long.
Couture just doesn't fit my body.
I'm cursed with ample bosom.
And yet you soldier on.
Oh, this is silly so "Tahani" means "congratulations" in Arabic.
You big flirt.
[giggles] Hey, babe, got you coffee.
Oh, great.
Oh, Andy's Coffee, uh, we shouldn't go there.
Everybody's boycotting.
Yeah, I know that one guy found a scorpion in his latte.
I don't really care, though, 'cause it's so close to here.
No, no, no, it's because he's sexually harassing people.
Here's the thing, sweetheart.
You're very qualified, but you're also what we call in the coffee shop game a, uh, "dog-face.
" You're a three, and you have to be a nine to work here.
It's just math.
So I didn't get the job? [chuckles] No, dog-face, you didn't get the job.
All right, I'll check your references.
- Just to be nice - Hey, my breasts! I'll check 'em.
Oh, they're good.
No, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there.
We can get coffee somewhere else.
Did you know your left reference is a little bit bigger than your right reference? It's not a bad thing, it's just it's a thing.
This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi.
Cartography.
Your neighborhood stretches way beyond what you've already seen.
And you can map it, revealing all of the mysteries, like an explorer.
I see how that might be fun.
" I once got lost on an escalator.
So not exactly Christopher Columbus.
Fun fact: Columbus is in the Bad Place because of all the raping, slave trade, and genocide.
The fact that it makes you nervous is exactly why you should do it.
You know, get out of your comfort zone.
Become a trail-blazer.
Fun fact: all deceased members of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team are also in the Bad Place.
[giggles] Yeah, sorry about this.
Fun fact: a "wheelhouse" is a part of a boat.
Okay, thank you, Janet, thank you.
Fun fact: Janet is me.
All right, let's forget about exploring.
Plenty more ideas for hobbies.
Let's walk back to town, shall we? - Wrong way.
- Yep.
Well, Glenn, we just wanted to make sure you were all right.
That is what a lot of people are saying.
Oh, everyone I know is saying that.
Yeah, it's just a big neighborhood full of enormous mansions and people who love Tahani! [both laughing] Eleanor and I just want to see if there's anything we can do to help you.
Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful.
Despite all the chaos earlier, we simply couldn't be happier.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli.
Please take a maple butter scone.
I made them fresh this morning.
Hmm.
Oh, fork, that's good.
Extra, extra! Read all about you.
Chidi, this is the perfect hobby for you.
- Journalism.
- Well, obviously, I like to write.
But I don't love deadlines.
I prefer to take my time with things.
" Look, Chidi, I'm just trying to find you a hobby the hat that will bring you a positive experience.
What do you say? I'm loving that hat on you.
It would look even better on my floor.
What is happening now? I suggested she be friendlier; she seems to have slipped right into overt sexuality.
I got something you can slip into.
- Oh - Janet, no! No, Janet.
Oh, Jianyu, darling, would you like some tea? That nod meant no, apparently.
Well, it was nice to get out and meet all of our wonderful neighbors.
Boop! Well, I should really be going.
I have to begin my 12 step Korean skincare regiment, but, uh, I'll see oh, no, no, no.
Please stay and enjoy the evening tea.
I'll see you soon.
Boop! "The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil.
" Okay.
Arc welding.
You could learn sculpture, you can make furniture, you can get your hands a little greasy, you know, and you make things.
Watch, I'll blowtorch your face off.
- Janet.
- Whatever.
This whole thing is stupid.
Oh, brother.
I told her to be less flirty and now she's cruel and distant, apparently.
I just can't get this right.
Thank you for trying to find me a new hobby.
Chidi, here's the thing see, I read your whole book, all 3,600 pages of it.
It's, um how shall I put this? It's a mess, dude.
- Hey! - She's right.
You see, Chidi, I can read the entirety of the world's literature in about an hour.
This took me two weeks to get through.
I mean, it's so convoluted, I just kept reading the same paragraph over and over again, trying to figure out what the heck you were saying.
Oh, no.
I mean, on page 1,000, you start section two with the sentence, "Of course, the exact opposite might be true.
I think you just twisted yourself up into a knot.
I have a very bad stomachache.
Hey, man.
[door closes] What's wrong? Am I a good teacher? Am I clear? Do I make sense? Yeah, you're a great teacher.
I'm super ethical now.
- What's that? - Hmm? Nah don't worry about it.
I stole Tahani's diary.
So I could see if her handwriting matches the note and also read about all the mean and terrible things she's definitely done so I can prove she's actually evil.
I know I broke some ethical rule, but I had good reason.
Eleanor, in order to be a good person, you have to do good things.
And not stealing people's stuff, that is just a basic kindergarten rule.
I mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand? First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.
Why would you even know that? Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does.
- She wrote that note.
- No she didn't! You did! I was hoping you would come to this conclusion on your own, but, obviously, no one here would ever threaten you.
That note is the Good Place manifesting your own guilt.
And as it turns out, I do belong here.
Because I'm just as good as everyone else.
No, no, no.
No, you don't belong here.
And in this place, everyone is better than you.
It has been proven by an infallible formula.
Tahani might be a little British and condescending at times, but she devoted her entire life to helping other people.
She's a good person.
Great news, I got us tickets to the Coyotes game.
- Awesome! - But, ooh, yikes.
Turns out two of the players have DUIs.
Guess we can't cheer for that team.
- Eleanor, I - You know what? Instead, let's just stay in, watch a Roman Polanski movie, listen to R.
Kelly, and eat Chik-fil-A.
Does that sound good? There's bad stuff everywhere, man.
It's impossible to avoid.
[sighs] Look, I know you're gonna break up with me, okay? I'm not an idiot.
I read your emails to your dad.
Have fun being so amazing and perfect until you die.
And by the way, I'm talking really fast because I still go to Andy's Coffee, and I got a full punch card, bro.
Good people make me insecure.
When I'm around someone who I think is better than me, I try and drag them down to my level.
That's why perfect Tahani is like my kryptonite.
Well, even admitting that is an important step.
Wait, what? Basically, my life's work is 3,600 pages of garbage.
Even Michael couldn't understand it.
So? - What does Michael know? - Everything.
That's my point he knows everything, and it was too convoluted, even for him.
Michael does not know everything.
Michael does not know I'm not supposed to be here.
You wrote 4,000 pages on one of the most complicated subjects in the world.
I mean I used to get bored halfway through writing a text message.
But even though I might have gotten lost in the weeds, I loved writing this book.
And I want to try again.
So will you be my advisor? Chidi, all I want is for you to be happy.
So if spending eternity getting blunt feedback on your circular, rambling ideas will make you happy, then of course I will be your advisor.
Let's throw that monstrosity in the trash and start over.
Aren't there maybe some parts worth salvaging? Honestly, man, I don't even know.
I mean, that thing is unreadable.
I literally learned what headaches were because that thing gave me a headache.
New beginnings! Well done.
[crying] [gentle knocking] Oh! Oh, hello, Eleanor.
Hi.
Sorry, I was just cleaning up.
You okay? Do you want to talk about it? Desperately.
It's Jianyu.
I just can't seem to connect with him.
I know that he took a vow of silence, but he won't even talk to me, his soul mate! And I adore talking.
Eleanor, you don't know what it's like to be in paradise and feel like there's something just not quite right.
Well I may not know exactly what you're feeling, but I do understand.
And you deserve to be happy, because you are an impressive, thoughtful, and special person.
Not to mention - you have a rockin' bod.
- [chuckles] I mean, Jianyu may be mute, - but he's not blind.
- [laughs] You two belong here.
And you belong together.
And you have all of eternity, so there's plenty of time for things to change.
Come here.
Ugh, of course your hugs are amazing.
[yawns] [yelps] Stupid ledge.
Ugh, stairs.
Everyone here is really into hugging.
Looks like someone learned something.
Well, it's 'cause someone else is a really good teacher.
Eleanor, hello.
It's not what she was designed to do.
- Didn't go great.
- But now I'm back to normal.
It turns out that the best Janet was the Janet that was inside Janet all along.
She was feeling a little lost, so I gave her a self-help book to restore her confidence.
Now I'm living my truth and creating my bliss.
Anyway, um, look, Michael asked me if I would serve as his assistant, but I'd quite like to focus on my relationship with Jianyu.
So I recommended you for the job.
You sent this to yourself.
This is your own guilt manifesting itself.
I've been waiting for you.
Jianyu? You talk now? You sent me these threatening notes? What the fork, man? Some Buddhist monk you are.
You don't belong here.
Admit it.
Okay, you're right.
I don't belong here.
I'm really trying to be a good person.
And I think I'm changing for the better, so just please, please don't rat me out.
Don't worry, I won't.
[sighs] Because I'm not supposed to be here, either.
I don't know how I got here, I have no idea what's going on, and I am freakin' out, homey! You got to help me.
I'm scared! What?
 Hang on, hang on You're not supposed to be here either? You're a mistake, just like me? Yeah, and I'm freaking out, dog.
There's so much thoughts in my brain, it's like my head is filled with rocks.
I'm Michael.
Before we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk and kept a vow of silence.
Would you prefer to remain silent here as well? You literally haven't said a word since we got here? Yeah.
When I say I'm meditating, I'm just trying to figure out what the fork is happening.
I think we might be in an alien zoo or on a prank show.
No, Jianyu, we're dead.
Whoa, that's a dope prank.
Pfff.
Is your real name Jianyu? No.
It's Jason Mendoza.
And by the way, everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese.
I'm Filipino.
That's racist.
Heaven is so racist.
But Tahani said that you helped Michael by putting your hand on his chest and doing some sort of healing magic.
Yeah.
I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.
It happens a lot.
What did you do for a living? I was an amateur DJ specializing in EDM.
Electronic dance music.
I was also an amateur hip-hop backup dancer, an amateur body spray inventor um, I did pranks on Vine.
None of those are jobs.
What did you do to make money? Oh, I sold fake drugs to college kids.
Okay, good.
Well, here's something for you to not talk about.
I don't belong here.
[laughs] They made a mistake.
Total phony.
So, shh! Okay, later, man.
Okay.
I vaguely remember that.
I believe you, Jason.
Hello, Tahani.
Oh, hello, Michael.
I was just picking out some fresh orchids for my nightly orchid bath.
So, Tahani, one of your fellow residents is opening a new restaurant tonight.
This neighborhood could use a real morale boost.
And since you're an expert at event planning, I was hoping that you would help with the grand opening.
Oh, Michael, say no more.
I wasn't going to.
Janet? - Hey, there.
- Oh, hello, darling.
I would like to model tonight's event on my most successful gala.
That would be 2006 fundraiser for stem cell research in Barcelona.
"Barthelona," actually.
Oh, it was a perfect evening.
Princess Stephanie was there, as were Posh and Becks.
You know, "International Sophisticate Magazine" gave us five Gwyneths.
Oh, well, good luck.
Thank you.
Yes, yes.
I'm excited.
And a little nervous.
I'd say that I'm cautiously optimistic.
[laughing] I hope I don't chicken out at the last second.
Sorry we are talking about suspenders, right? Like these? You can do that with oh! [laughs] I cannot wait.
She thinks I'm a monk, and she thinks you're her best friend.
Great.
I mean, for us.
It's a huge bummer for her.
We need someplace that we can talk in private.
I agree.
Let me show you my bud-hole.
What? I should warn you: it's a little messy.
Oh, bud-hole! Okay, now I get it.
I wrote down on a piece of paper that I needed a private meditation area.
Tahani will never come in.
Pretty unique decorating style you have here, Jianyu.
It's like, "12-year-old boy" meets "13-year-old boy.
" Thanks.
Janet helped me get all this stuff.
She rules.
And B: you have to keep pretending to be Tahani's soul mate.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cool.
Okay, just sit tight, dude.
I have a class to get to.
Wha a class? I didn't know there were classes.
Chidi is trying to teach me to be a good person.
My whole situation here is getting more and more dicey, so I'm actually really glad to have a place I can come when I just want to be myself.
Yeah.
I miss being myself.
Myself was the best.
[crowd shouting] [EDM music playing] Whoo! Whoo! What's up, man? You're Jason? You got two minutes.
Fred Durst is throwing an orgy on a partially capsized yacht.
My dad just texted.
It already started.
You're terrible.
- Really? - Yeah.
Okay? You just don't have any what's the word? Talent.
But don't worry.
You got something better than talent, man.
You got my approximate size and weight.
I'm supposed to play this club for the rest of the week, but I just got an offer to DJ Scott Disick's after party for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno.
Whoa! Congrats, bro.
It's my Tuesday.
I just need somebody to fill in.
Put on the helmet.
Press spacebar on the computer.
Those idiots won't know the difference.
For the next week, Jason, you are Acidcat.
Whoa, there's a lot of old gum in here.
Tahani, how are things going in the front of the house? Because, to be perfectly frank, things in the kitchen are going great, okay? I am right on schedule.
Thank you for your thoughtfulness and hard work.
I could not have done this without you.
Ah, hello, Tahani.
Sorry.
I should've warned you.
Patricia is actually very happy, but she's also very intense.
It can be confusing.
No, no, no, that's not what's bothering me.
Jianyu is a beautiful spirit, but he literally doesn't talk, and since this will be an evening of lively conversation, and you'll be busy working, I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.
I totally understand.
Well reasoned, Michael.
As us Brits are fond of saying, "try your best to hide your sadness.
" So, the concept of the self is a key subject for a lot of great thinkers.
In the "Tao Te Ching," Lao Tzu wrote, "Knowing others is wisdom, but knowing the self is enlightenment.
" Ahh, "knowing" yourself.
Is he talking about what I think he's talking about? No, Eleanor.
" - You read this, right? - I did.
Well, I tried to.
Well, I tried to want to.
Um, actually, could we postpone this lesson? I've befriended Jianyu from next door, and I thought I could learn from him.
That's a great idea.
Hume's "bundle theory" of the self is fairly close to Buddhism.
Yeah.
No durr.
That's EDM.
What are you doing? Eleanor, you were right.
No more pretending.
It's time for me to be myself.
What's up, homie? Eleanor? You broke Jianyu.
Okay, did we miss anything? Ugh, take that jersey off, you goofball.
Okay.
This is not my fault.
Right.
But here's the thing: Jianyu is actually a guy who is nice.
Hi, Tahani.
Eleanor, Chidi, What a lovely surprise.
Don't mind me.
I'm just dropping off my afternoon gloves, and picking up my early evening gloves.
How are you, soul mate? I'm cool.
I'm sorry.
I don't think that happened.
You're you're wrong.
I see what's going on here.
You've got a whisper in your snickerbox.
You're both helping Jianyu to regain his confidence to be able to speak again as a surprise for me! Oh, busted.
My heart is soaring.
So, Jianyu is talking? Oh, how wonderful! I will do everything in my power to encourage him.
Well, not everything.
No.
Better not risk it.
I've actually had a better idea.
- Oh.
- Let's add Jianyu to the guest list.
Chidi and Eleanor have been working with him, - and they're going to be here.
- What a great idea.
Patricia! We can fit another chair, right? Change the floor plan an hour before opening? Of course! The more the merrier! Hurrah! I knew tonight was going to be perfect, but now it's going to be even perfect-er.
That's how you got BeyoncÃ©.
Oh! Oh, bud-hole.
Okay.
Now, tell me everything.
Okay, Jianyu is a fraud, just like me.
His real name is Jason.
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.
It's gonna be fine.
We hack into Michael's phone, download all his nudes, and then blackmail him.
No.
What are you t no.
Yo, you should listen to me.
I came up with hundreds of plans in my life, and only one of them got me killed.
Dude, be quiet.
You are not Jason.
You are a monk named Jianyu.
They don't love me, man.
They love Acidcat.
These cheers are fake.
They hit my ears like boxing gloves of sadness.
Whoa, that's some poetic thoughts, B.
I got to be myself.
[crowd cheering] Attention, Jacksonville.
I'm not Acidcat.
And this is a Mr.
Music, the DJ original.
Pow! [dance music plays] Whoo! [crowd booing] Aah! [glass clinking] Welcome to the opening of The Good Plates.
[laughs] I just got that.
[laughter] That's hilarious! Anyway, at some point or another, every resident in this neighborhood will fulfill his or her soul's true purpose.
Chef Patricia has done that tonight by opening this restaurant.
Now if you'd all like to take a look at tonight's menus That's right.
With Michael's help, Chef Patricia has recreated each person's favorite meal on Earth.
Almost makes me forget how miserable I am right now.
You want to try a bite? Fish and peanut butter? No, I'm good.
Thanks.
Tofu? Oh, man.
I'ma order some jalapeÃ±o poppers.
Shh.
Be quiet and eat your white sponge.
Janet? - Hi, there.
According to our files, your favorite meal was the hunger strike you went on to protest Bolivian sex trafficking.
Oh, right.
Of course I did that.
Tahani, great party.
Check it out.
Suspenders! [laughing] So dumb.
So much dumber than belts.
[laughing] Oh, congratulations, Michael.
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.
May I have your attention, please? Later this evening, we will be enjoying Chef Patricia's delicious dessert, a stunning three-tiered cake that took her a full week to complete.
But first, I'd like to try something fun.
Each one of you has a very special memory attached to the meal you're eating.
Why don't we go around the room and share our stories? Who'd like to begin? I'll start, Michael.
[clears throat] One day, I wasn't feeling so great, so I made myself a bowl of this chicken soup When it gets to you, say something short and boring about tofu.
No.
- Which is? - The Buffalo wings at Stupid Nick's Wing Dump in Gainesville.
Wings were free for ladies if they took their top off.
Oh, boy.
- Chidi, a word? - Yeah.
Anyway, that's how this simple soup saved over 10,000 lives.
If Jianyu starts talking about topless Buffalo wing restaurants, we're all screwed.
Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese monk who took a vow of silence at the age of eight and hasn't spoken since, is ready to share with us.
Let me tell you about Stupid Nick.
Eleanor, Chef Patricia poured her heart and soul into this.
Destroying it would be a truly cruel act.
Yeah, no durr.
No, no, no oh! [all screaming] Sinkhole! Everyone out! There's a sinkhole! [all screaming] Aah! Glenn! You broke the world.
That's not a compliment.
Glenn, stay calm.
We're gonna get you out of there.
And we'll put your soup in the fridge so it won't go to waste.
Let's go.
Hey, buddy.
You okay? No.
I was just about to tell an awesome story about a wing eating contest that I lost and a barfing contest that I won, but then a hole opened up in the ground.
I know.
I made the hole to save you from yourself.
You cannot let people know who you really are.
It would be very, very bad.
Things are bad, Pillboi.
Acidcat is suing me for "bleach of contract.
" I should have never pretended to be someone else.
It could cost me all my dreams in life.
You got dreams in life? That's lit.
Of course I have dreams, man.
I don't want to be a DJ in Jacksonville forever.
I want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee, Tampa, even.
I know, but I believe in myself.
Someday, the world will see what I already know: that Jason Mendoza is a beautiful, unique soul who has so much to give this world.
Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat.
Hand me the thing that blows it up.
[Pillboi yells indistinctly] [boom] Michael, I hereby tender my resignation.
I can no longer in good conscience coordinate any further events in The Good Place.
So, I am turning in my evening gloves.
- Tahani - Don't try to make me feel better.
My hair is barely cascading down my shoulders.
Tahani, please.
I know your journey with Jianyu has been frustrating, but your situation is actually very typical.
Soul mates sometimes take months to really click.
You have to be patient.
And if anyone should take the blame for the restaurant disaster, it's me.
I thought this neighborhood's troubles were behind us.
Now I fear the worst.
- What can I do? - Oh, well, the sinkhole should be repairing itself in about three days.
Well, as soon as it does, we shall re-launch the restaurant.
I'll hang posters to get the word out, and in the meantime, I'll host a brunch party every morning to lift people's spirits.
- Ah! - While you repair the universe, I shall prepare the eggs.
Oh, fanciful wordplay.
Indeed.
That is the Tahani that you know and love.
- So what do we do here? - There's nothing to do.
I can't believe I'm doing this, but, Jason, please come to my classroom.
I will teach you ethics, like I'm doing with Eleanor.
And if you work hard and absorb the material, you just might be able to earn your place here.
[light, suspenseful music] No, I'm good.
[game gunfire continue] Dude, Chidi is giving you a lifeline right now, and you need to take it because you suck.
- You suck! - I know! That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We both suck.
You know who doesn't suck? Chidi.
You didn't get into heaven at all, shirt-for-brains.
I just want to be myself.
That's a very, very bad idea.
Do not be yourself.
You need to be a better version of yourself, okay? And I do too.
And our only hope right now is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd.
Think about that.
Do you have to call me a nerd so much? I said a lot of other nice things, okay? Toughen up, nerd.
Wow, that's really impressive.
Where's Jianyu? Honestly, I don't even know if he's coming.
I am here to learn about ethnics.
Wow, that's great, man.
I mean, it's "ethics," but that's great.
Pretty sure it's "ethnics.
" Hey, buddy, I'm proud of you.
This is your first step towards not sucking.
Oh, wow.
For the first time ever, I'm the smartest kid in class.
[rumbling] [suspenseful music] [rumbling] [rocks clattering] [wood creaking] [gasps] [ominous music]
1 Good afternoon, Eleanor.
What can I get you today? Whoa.
Lot of new flavors.
Michael felt bad about the sinkhole, so he wanted to give you all a little treat.
I recommend "Full Cell Phone Battery.
Oh, I'm so relaxed.
But they all look good.
This might take me a while.
You know what, Gunnar, uh, why don't you go ahead? - Thanks so much, Eleanor.
- Mm-hmm.
- What can I get you, Gunnar? - Hi, Janet.
- Can I have some Folded Laundry? - Coming up.
[indistinct chatter] [upbeat music] Chidi! You'll never believe it.
I didn't even try a dozen samples I didn't want just to spite some jerk who told me I was holding up the line.
You do that? No, Chidi, I used to do that.
Now I do selfless things without even thinking about it.
That's great.
I-I'm proud of you.
So where's our yogurt? Ugh.
I forgot it.
Oh Can you go? I don't want to go all the way back.
Good person.
So, to sum up: Utilitarianism posits that the correct choice is the one that causes the most good or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering.
I like this one.
It's simple.
Ugh, screw all the other complicated theories, why didn't you start with this one? Ah, but here's the problem.
If all that matters is the sum total of "goodness," then you can justify any number of bad actions, like torturing one innocent person to save a hundred, or preemptive war Oh, dip, I get it.
It's like, I knew this girl Sheila? She was a black market alligator dealer with a pierced jawbone.
Um, okay, what? Sheila was gonna get married to my boy, Donkey Doug and make him move to Sarasota.
I framed one innocent gator dealer to save a 60-person dance crew.
Shockingly, that is a relevant example of the Utilitarian dilemma.
- Well done.
- Thanks! Um - Uh, yes, Jianyu? - Can I be excused? Tahani's doing a brunch party and I want to get there before all the mini-waffles run out.
- Go ahead, man.
- Yes! So, you want to roll right into another lesson? I am revved up to learn, man.
My brain is horny! Um, can we take a little break? I've been standing at this chalkboard all day.
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Ah, Tahani.
I've been working on my Western Hemisphere brunch banter.
Tell me what you think.
That "New Yorker" article was crazy.
You haven't seen "Hamilton"? Hey, did you hear about Stephanie? - Very well done, Michael.
- Hi, there! We have a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis.
A Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis? - Mm-hmm.
- Sorry, what is a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis? It's nothing, it's a tiny little inconvenience.
We have to go into the sinkhole and fix it by hand.
Get the tools.
Sorry, can I be of any service? - Ah, Tahani.
- Didn't see you there.
Uh, no, no.
We're just having a slight problem with the enormous sinkhole.
Yes, I meant to tell you I walked past it last night and I I actually saw it get a little bit bigger.
[screams] It got bigger? Ah, well, that's that's so normal.
Finally! Let's get back to it.
Whip out that chalkboard, big boy, show me what you're working with.
Actually, I was going to head into town and pick up some blankets.
Great, I'll grab my sweater.
I can practice letting people cut in front of me.
You know, uh, I just realized that I have blankets, so I'm going to take a nap using the several blankets that I already have.
Good night.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
No big deal.
The way you're talking to me right now? "Everything's cool, no big deal" I know that move.
When I told a boyfriend something was "no big deal," it meant anything from "I just bought weed from your nephew," to "I secretly befriended your ex-girlfriend last year, things got out of hand, and now I'm her bridesmaid.
" Wow.
Okay, well, in this case, it really is no big deal.
Dude, you're hiding something! - What's wrong? - Nothing! What is wrong? [device chimes] Jianyu second.
Oh, well done, my love.
So where am I? Eleanor 6th? Come on.
Mummy, I made you this.
It's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.
Thank you, Tahani.
It's very competent.
I made a bird, as well.
I worked in a reflective alloy, holding up a mirror to mankind and its mistreatment of these defenseless animals.
Excellent, Kamilah.
I sense the influence of Brancusi and Kapoor.
I grew tired of objective representation.
I trust my audience.
My birdie has a hat.
Yes, well done, Tahani.
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
- Would you stop doing that? - What's wrong? - Okay, fine! - What's wrong? You want to know what's wrong? You are a full-time job.
And then it's, "Good night, Eleanor.
" Oh, this is a nice dream, my grandma's here.
Wait, she's got Eleanor's face! And tentacles for some reason.
I thought you liked teaching me.
So now I'm just some huge burden for you? Yes! Of course you are! I am in paradise! I should be doing paradise things, like rowing out on a lake with a good bottle of wine, reading French poetry.
That's your idea of paradise? You know, and I can't stop helping you, because then I am shirking my ethical duty.
It's an impossible position! You know what, if you're so stressed from writing on a chalkboard, why don't you just leave? We can pretend to be soul mates in public, but other than that, we don't have to see each other! Fine with me! I'll move out right now.
Fine! [alarm blares] Good afternoon.
Starting right now, no one may go outside under any circumstances.
Leaving your homes could result in catastrophic damage, to you and to the very fabric of the universe.
Okay, bye.
Or we could both just stay here.
We hope you enjoy your eternal stay in the Good Place.
Take advantage of our day spa, or Janet a magical assistant who can get you whatever you want.
You mind turning that off? It's been playing on a loop for two days.
The whole Neighborhood is offline.
[gasps] What have you done to me, you monster? Look at all these dishes piling up.
I used to just throw them in the sink, and they'd be magically cleaned by morning.
I did that.
I cleaned the dishes.
Oh.
Then what's up with these bad boys? You are unbelievable.
Are you still upset? - You're not over it yet? - How can I be over it? We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice "vacation" from your "full-time job.
Oh, I'd love to make small talk I've been practicing, too.
I'm amazing at it but I'm in a bit of a rush here.
This is Bart and Nina.
They live right next door to the, uh, sinkhole, so they obviously need a place to stay.
I was wondering, as my assistant, maybe you could put them up for a while? Oh, of course.
Don't don't think twice.
Okay, shouldn't take long.
Between an hour and, um 11 months.
Don't go outside.
[door closes] Ha [chuckles] Hello, everyone, and welcome to day three of our brunch siege.
I stayed up all night to plan a full day of fun activities.
Just check the schedule I made.
Tahani, you are truly the best.
Yes, you would think so, wouldn't you, Henriette? [device chimes] Still second to last.
[sighs] [indistinct chatter] Tahani! This auction threatens to be an embarrassing failure.
5.
" Your public failure is our public failure.
You know what has to be done.
I'm very pleased to announce that there has been an addition to today's docket.
I'm sure you all know my sister, Kamilah.
[cheers and applause] Yes.
Kamilah.
Kamilah, of course, is the youngest person ever to graduate from Oxford University, she's a world-class painter, social activist, iconoclast, Olympic gold medalist for archery, a BAFTA Award-winner for her documentary on her Grammy Award-winning album, and the person voted "Most Likely to be Banksy.
" So without further ado, take it away from me! Sorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah.
[excited murmuring] 5 million! [crowd exclaims] Thank you guys so much.
- Sorry for the imposition.
- Oh, bah.
Oh, well, if you want to know the truth, we asked Michael if we could stay with you.
We are obsessed with your relationship.
Always whispering, locking yourself in the house all day.
I thought I was an expert in true love 'cause of my old job, but I have a lot to learn from you guys.
Your job? What was your job? I was a marriage counselor.
" both: Oh, cool.
- Really cool.
- Cool.
- Really, really cool.
- Cool, cool.
And what about you, Bart? Oh, well, my job wasn't nearly as interesting.
I started a company that investigated identity theft.
Analyzing body language, tracking and catching people pretending to be someone they're not.
I say we do it.
It'll get 'em to stop asking questions.
No, I am not going to have sex with someone to get them to stop talking to me! Really? You and I are very different.
Yeah, I noticed! You know what, man? I have spent every second in this place worried I was gonna get caught, but if we go down right now, that's on you, okay? Oh, you spend all your time teaching a charming, awesome lady? How sad for you.
Face it, dude.
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
Because guess what, Chidi? - Ya basic! - Eleanor Yeah, I know, you want to do that thing where we're arguing and fighting, but then suddenly it's like, "Whoa, this is hot," and we start making out.
Dream on! Or, whatever, fine, let's just do it.
We're not judging you.
This has been a tough couple of weeks.
I'm sure the stress of the sinkhole has caused lots of soul mate squabbles.
Yes, that's what it is.
A squabble.
- We're squabbling.
- Squabble, squabble! I can help.
I'm gonna take your relationship and put it under a microscope and dig and poke and prod until you are back to soul mate harmony.
We just have different interests.
I like relaxing, he likes getting on my case about the dishes.
I'm getting a lot of repressed anger.
I suspected this when I arrived, but now I'm sure.
- You are hiding something.
- What on earth would I be No, no, no, not you.
Him.
Please go back inside.
Janet, could you see what's wrong? Everything.
Ugh.
My goodness! It's even worse than I thought.
Tahani, what're you doing here? Well, everyone else might be okay staying inside, but I wanted to help.
So I've brought some cheer and sustenance to raise your spirits.
Look, I made donut holes.
Do you get it? "Donut holes"? Sinkhole.
- Funny, no? - No, too soon.
If a human gets too close to it, there could be disastrous side effects.
[shimmering tones] What's what's happening to me? Oh, that's one of the side effects.
Janet, knock her out while we still have time.
Knock me out? What does that Boop.
Guys, really, it's no big deal.
"It's not a big deal" is nearly always code for "something is wrong.
" Boom! That's what I said.
I should've been a marriage counselor.
Be, like, the exact right amount of honest so that we can both be happy.
I never had a soul mate on earth.
I-I never even really had a girlfriend that I "loved.
" And when I got here, and Michael said I would finally meet my actual soul mate, I was so excited.
And it isn't exactly what I thought.
You've never had an intense relationship before.
This is all uncharted territory.
No wonder you're so tense.
Although, it can be, and it often leads there, anyway Okay, well, you know what? You guys have given us so much to think about.
And I think we should go to bed.
Just the two of us, alone.
Just us.
[whispers] I know it's not the right time, but I told you.
Tahani, wake up, dear.
Michael.
Did it work? Did I fix the sinkhole? Am I a heroine? No, you did something catastrophically stupid and we had to knock you unconscious.
It's got some very sensitive material.
Plus some song lyrics I've been working on, and I'd rather not let people see those until they're finished.
Anyway, why did seeing the rankings unravel you so? I was so sorry to hear of your parents' passing.
Please bear with me as I share their last will and testament.
"To Kamilah, we have left Â£68 million, "the home in Kensington, the yacht, and other assorted weekend boats.
" Well, what did they leave their second favorite child? There's still quite a lot of money and property that goes to you.
There is one issue, however.
They have, um, spelled your name incorrectly in the will.
" Like the sauce.
You know what? I don't want the money.
My sister can have it all.
My whole life, I have lived in your shadow, but now I'm going to step out of it.
I am going to reach heights of success and sophistication that you can only dream of.
Your cardigan's on inside out.
I know! It's a new trend that I am starting.
Just one example of how I'm going to step out of your shadow.
My entire life, I have tried to be extraordinary, but it just never seemed to be enough.
Ah.
And you thought you could increase your ranking by helping us fix the sinkhole.
Tahani, the point evaluations stop the moment you die.
But also, out of literally billions, you were one of the most remarkable people on Earth.
You have nothing left to prove, to anyone.
- [chiming] - Hi, there.
The sinkhole has begun to repair itself.
You have nothing to do with it.
We've got to leave immediately.
It's now safe to go outside.
It's now safe to go outside.
It's now safe to go outside.
- Morning, teach! - Morning.
What's this about? Well, here's what I realized.
It's not just that helping me is a full-time job that you feel you have to do.
- [laughs] Every ounce of my happiness leads to a ton of pain for you.
So every time the simple fact of my existence starts to bum you out, I want you to hold this up.
[laughs] At which point, I will leave you alone for as long as you need.
I know we'll never be soul mates, but we're friends.
Now get in this boat and read some boring French poetry.
I I've never actually done this before.
This is a theoretical fantasy.
How do you row a boat? I'll tell ya, it's good as new.
Hey, boss.
So you fixed the sinkhole.
Yup, good as new.
Crisis averted.
Everybody have a wonderful day, because I fixed the sinkhole.
- I didn't fix the sinkhole.
- Sorry? I tried and I tried, but nothing worked.
And then all of a sudden this morning, out of the blue, it just whoop! It just closed over.
No, this is terrible news! I have no idea what caused it, Eleanor.
And no idea what fixed it.
I want you to come to my office first thing in the morning.
You and I are gonna find this problem.
1 [upbeat music] - What are you doing? - [gasps] Dude, I'm freaked out about my meeting with Michael, and if I spend one more second staring at Creepo the Clown, I'm gonna lose it.
You named the clowns? Psycho, Creepo, Crazy Head, Stupid Juggling Weirdo, Freaky Feet, and Nightmare George Washington.
One of them has to go.
Oh, sexy mailman.
I mean, I did promise I would help.
What do I do here? Actually, the answer is Right here in this easily understandable comic strip.
Nope, in this book about the theory of contractualism.
"What We Owe to Each Other.
" [gasps] I saw this movie.
Laura Linney cries in a lake house because Jude Law left her for his ex-wife's ghost.
No.
Quick summary of contractualism.
So if you said, "We should be able to break our promises without any repercussions," someone would veto that rule.
Well, my first rule would be that no one can veto my rules.
Well, that's called tyranny.
And it's generally frowned upon.
If you make a promise to someone, you should do it.
Just like I promised to help you and still am, despite your constant mockery.
[mockingly] "Despite your constant mockery.
" Whatever, you love it.
That's literally not possible.
Oh, really? I once posed as a hot prom date for my cousin, both helping him and later, according to his therapist, not helping him.
[mumbling indistinctly] [knocking] Oh, hey, Eleanor, thanks for coming in.
Sorry about the mess.
[clears throat] Oh, I forgot, you don't see in nine dimensions.
There's just a lot of there's a lot of tension in the air right now.
Are you okay, buddy? - You seem kind of stressed.
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
There you go.
So to prepare to meet all of you, I studied the human concept of friends.
I even watched all ten seasons of the show "Friends.
" Boy, those friends really were "friends," weren't they? Although and I realize this is the kind of observation that would only occur to the mind of an eternal being How did they afford that apartment? A waitress and a chef with those Manhattan real estate prices.
Yeah, we were all confused about that too.
Anyway, it's been a tough couple of days.
Right now, I could really use a friend by my side.
Well, you know me.
As I told you before, my mom is very sick.
I'm gonna help her move into assisted living.
Well, I'm here for you.
And your Wi-Fi is way better than my neighbor's, so I'm in.
It's gonna mean taking care of Lester too.
Walk and feed him twice a day.
Give him his kidney medicine.
Yup, got it feed his kidneys.
I won't let you down.
I promise.
[sighs] Jianyu, my love.
How are you? - I am decidedly so.
- That's very profound.
Um, soul mate an idea.
Our neighborhood now features a spa, and it offers couples packages.
And I thought maybe we could get facials and do yoga and talk in long, discursive sentences.
We'll go today.
Dude, you got to come with us to the spa.
No way.
No, that's really weird.
You can't make small talk with her for one day without being caught? No, I can't, and she freaks me out.
She's so pretty, like Nala from "The Lion King.
" And she talks so smart, like, um Nala from "The Lion King.
" You got to help me.
Which means maybe I'm obligated to tell her.
Although maybe it's better not to know.
Is ignorance bliss, or will the painful truth actually be healing You ready, Jianyu? Oh, I cannot wait to just relax and talk and chat and just, you know get to know each other.
Hey! Maybe I'll come too.
Oh.
Well, Chidi it's just that this is, um this is really more of a couples thing.
I know.
But Eleanor's off with Michael, and Jianyu feels comfortable when I'm around.
You were made in Taiwan.
So couples date! Let's go! I never really looked around your office the first day.
What is all this junk? Well, technically, architects aren't allowed to own any human objects, but oh, I just love them so much.
And over here, look at this.
Aren't paper clips the most amazing things in the world? Yeah.
Sure.
Anyway, my current theory is that some object in the neighborhood is a design flaw which is causing everything to go haywire.
So we need to find that object.
These 78 are the most suspicious.
Maybe to an architect, they might look suspicious, but to me, they just look like rocks, so I'm not sure how I can help.
Do any of them look defective? Sinister? You know, like they're taunting you? Always one step ahead? You devious little monsters, you.
Okay, let's take a deep breath here, buddy.
You need to chill a little.
'Cause you have a very psycho, "burnout guy muttering to himself at a library computer" type vibe.
It's my responsibility to solve the problem.
What else can I do except keep working? You could stop working.
I promise this is gonna help both of us.
Let's go.
Okay.
Let's keep our eyes peeled for twigs that may have a nefarious agenda.
- Okay, crazy, come on.
- Yeah.
Hello, Janet.
Jianyu and I are here for the couples package, please.
Couples are pairs of people.
Yup, and, uh, there is a pair of people, Tahani and Jianyu.
And then also I am here.
Great, and who will be joining you? No one.
Um, it's really quite simple, Janet.
They are a couple, and I am a third part of that couple.
Uh, a helper part who is here for fun and excitement.
It's a three-person couple.
I'm just kidding.
[laughs] I mean, it doesn't compute, but I'm not gonna explode or anything.
Right.
Well, I'll see you inside, darling.
Okay, you have to step up.
Find a way to connect with her without, you know, being you.
What does that even mean? Do I talk or not talk? Do I be nice to Tahani, or do I throw all her jewelry in the toilet? That's the opposite of being nice? So no toilet? What is it with you and frozen yogurt? Have you not heard of ice cream? Oh, sure, but I've come to really like frozen yogurt.
There's something so human about taking something great and ruining it a little so you can have more of it.
I'm gonna tell you a secret.
Usually, architects don't live in their neighborhoods.
Usually, the people show up, we play the movie, Janet is there to answer questions, and you're on your own.
But I had this theory.
I thought transition would be easier if the architect were on-site for at least the first 1,000 years or so.
That's why you've been so freaked out.
'Cause your butt is on the line.
My boss thought I was nuts.
And you just don't break a promise.
Unlike Ross when he promised Emily not to talk to Rachel.
Wow, you are really into that show.
You know something? I feel better already.
Should we get back to work? Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.
The whole point is to stop thinking about work and start having fun.
Now, what should we do first? both: I'm going out In a blaze of glory Lord, I never drew first But I drew first blood And I'm no one's son So call me young gun Whoo! This is so interesting! I mean, there's no point to it.
The images on the screen relate to nothing.
Okay, my hands are heated to the ideal 105 degrees.
Who would like to go first? Oh, well what if I go first, and then perhaps Jianyu could stand near me and share some intimate aspects of his life? Or what if while Janet messages Tahani, I massage Jianyu? Jianyu, darling, let's discuss the arts.
I adore the impressionists.
Who's your favorite artist? I mean, Pitbull changed the game Sorry, just working the oft-neglected mandible area.
[muffled speech] [playful music] [laughs] Oh, man! I didn't even want that thing.
Why am I trying to win it? Because the machine says it's a prize.
- Oh! - Boom! How many tickets do I get? Six? - Is that all? - Well, watch this.
[pounding] - Is that allowed? - Not really.
I got it.
I got it.
- Whoo! - Whoo! [clapping] You know something? As much as I've always wanted to be around humans, I think I've missed a big part of what makes them wonderful.
Sometimes all you guys think about is how you can have the most fun.
Exactly! That was practically my mantra.
What's up, dong bait? [laughs] Drop everything you're doing.
Rihanna is performing in Vegas.
I got tickets.
I'm sorry, does this dog smoke blunts topless on a yacht like a boss? - 'Cause that's how Ri-Ri do.
- That's a very good point.
This is floor seats in Vegas for Rihanna.
The booze is free there.
Do I really need to keep going? Okay, this is dinner tonight, breakfast tomorrow I have an idea.
This is in case of emergency.
Do not eat this unless it's an emergency.
Wow.
Yes, it's 'cause my pores are just so small.
There's no way anything could ever adhere to my skin.
It's a curse, really.
Jianyu? What are your pores like? [sighs] Janet, can you show me to the sauna, please? Dude, she's trying so hard, and you're giving her nothing! Just pick a fact that you know about her and just muddle through.
She said she likes impressionist paintings.
Impressionist paintings? Okay, say no more.
No, no, no, I definitely feel like I need to say more.
Jia [laughs] So would you say I helped you today? Oh, so much.
All right, I'll see you tomorrow, friend.
[romantic music playing] You sure this is where you want to be right now? At the Tea for Two couples cafe? There's no use avoiding it, Chidi.
I'm alone.
Jianyu and I have nothing in common.
I just want a soul mate.
Someone I can share my passions with, someone who I can talk to about the ethereal colors of a Degas.
I love Degas.
I took painting lessons as a kid, and Degas was always my inspiration.
- But they have great museums.
- Yes.
Welcome to my cafe, you two.
We have a special on soul mate muffins.
Two for the price of zero.
Everything is free.
Oh, uh, we're not soul mates.
- No.
Hey, buddy.
I have all new fun stuff for us to do today.
Eleanor, I have huge news.
Not working actually worked.
It did what now? After our day off, with a completely clear head, I realized part of what makes humans so fun is that they're unpredictable.
The chaos we've been experiencing is exactly what would happen if a resident behaved unpredictably.
The problem in our neighborhood it's not a rock or an object.
It's one of the people.
I mean, does he or she even know that they caused all these problems? No, that can't be.
I mean, what kind of monster would wreak havoc and then say nothing? So this is the main place where the garbage fell from the sky.
- Janet.
- Hi there.
I need a list of everyone that was here on garbage duty during orientation.
Oh.
Eleanor, our criminal is on this very short list.
People were flying that day too.
Eleanor, our criminal is on this much longer list.
[sighs] Oh, hey, homey.
Thanks for your advice.
I'm about to give Tahani the best gift ever.
Check it.
What? She likes impressionist paintings, right? I got her a painting of the best impressionist of all time, Frank Caliendo.
He can do it all fat Al Pacino, fat Jerry Seinfeld, regular John Madden.
"Say hello to my little friend.
And the guest list that night was limited.
There were a total of 30 people here that night.
[laughs] Only 30, huh? How do you pump your fists again? Is this it? But 66 others passed through to take a look before it opened, and everyone else in the neighborhood was in a close radius.
Oh, boy, that doesn't narrow it down at all.
Feels like the end of the road.
"End of the Road," Boyz II Men, karaoke.
Let's go don't think about it too much.
Janet.
I can't help the people I promised that I would help.
I feel like "Friends" in season eight, out of ideas and forcing Joey and Rachel together, even though it made no sense.
I hope the sinkhole opens up again and swallows me whole.
Paula! Hey, girl.
How's the dog? Still fat, Eleanor.
Still fat.
The vet says his stomach expanded to the size of a basketball and that it will never shrink.
Oh, well, that's not my fault.
Well, you know what? You're rude.
'Cause you didn't even ask me how the Rihanna concert was.
She was very late.
And a little drunk.
I promised to help you, and I will, however I can.
If you want to look at a million rocks like a psychopath, I'll be there.
If you want to just lay here and cry in your hoodie, I'm cool with that.
Honestly, I don't know how I can help you, 'cause I'm just a person and you're, like, this super magical Orville Redenbacher type guy who invented this entire universe, but I'll do my best.
Of course.
How did I not see it? Janet I found the answer to the problem.
Call a neighborhood meeting.
Should it be festive and casual or moribund and devastating? Moribund and devastating, please.
Great! [dramatic music] Hello, Jianyu, Chidi.
What's this? I made you a art.
It's three of me.
It's ballerinas, painted in the style of the impressionists.
And you feel things.
Only my true soul mate could ever give me such a perfect gift.
Thank you.
[indistinct chatter] What's going on? Well, I did what you said.
I honored my agreement to help Michael find the problem, and he found the problem.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
After I'm gone, take down the rest of those clown paintings.
But leave up the sexy mailman.
I have finally discovered the cause.
There was one common link among every incident.
And when I figured it out, it was a shock.
But there's no escaping it.
The problem is me.
[all gasp] And now I have to leave you forever.
[suspenseful music]
There's no escaping it.
Michael, you can't be the problem.
Oh, but I am.
You see, architects aren't supposed to live in the neighborhoods they design, but I love humans, so I-I wanted to try.
I see now that was a mistake.
My meddling is the one true constant in all of our disasters.
I tried to force Jianyu into opening up, which caused a sinkhole to open up.
I kicked a puppy into the Sun, and garbage rained down.
I grossly underestimated the number of shrimp needed for the opening-night party, and what flew through the sky the next day, taunting me for my failures? I'm sorry, everyone.
You see, the only way in and out of a neighborhood is by train, and Janet is the only one who can operate them.
Oh, my dear Janet.
Will you be okay after I leave? Yes.
This will not affect me in any way.
Jeez, show some compassion.
Well, I can't feel sad, but here's my best approximation of human crying.
Baaah! [wailing awkwardly] - Oh, Janet, that was beautiful.
- Yeah.
Michael's gonna get a chill retirement, which, frankly, he desperately needs, and I can finally relax.
It's forking perfect.
No, it's terrible.
Michael's wrong.
He's not the problem.
Well, Michael did bring me here, which was the mistake that led to all the other problems.
So, in that sense, he is the real problem.
Ha! How do you like them ethics? I just ethics'd you in the face, Chidi! It doesn't change the fact that we weren't truthful.
" - That's it? - It's more poetic in Mandarin.
Look, Michael is retiring.
He's gonna be on an angel boat somewhere, smoking moonbeam cigars.
Now, Tahani is throwing him a good-bye party.
Let's go help out.
Sure, that will more than make up for the pain and misery and lying.
Yes, now you're getting it.
Hey, Chidi, just read your article on logical positivism so dry.
Oh, yeah, just got 'em.
Saw them in the store, and I was just like, "Whoa!" Tell the truth do you like 'em? Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
- Not too red? - No.
- Crystals aren't too much? Crystals are not too much.
Oh, well, that makes me feel much better 'cause I was really going back and forth over whether they were worth the money.
They were super expensive.
Yeah, well, they're, uh, amazing.
Right.
Bye.
[bell tolling] My God what have I done? Tonight needs to be the perfect blend of celebratory, reverential, bittersweet, upbeat, fun, and effortless.
This is #TahaniTime.
What is all this? Oh, no, Michael, you're not supposed to see it till it's all set up.
But, well, welcome to your retirement party.
Look, over there, I've even set up a buffet of themed desserts, like retire-mint chocolate cake or, uh, "flan voyage.
" [chuckles] Oh, boy.
It's called "pleurigloss.
" Could you describe it? It's the color of [sighs] When a soldier comes home from war and sees his dog for the first time.
Hmm.
How about blue? Tahani, I'm so sorry.
We need to cancel this party immediately.
But why? For a being like me, retirement is not something fun.
What is "retirement" for you exactly? Well, I wasn't gonna share this so as not to upset you, but it's, a an extreme form of punishment.
We call it "The Eternal Shriek.
Oh, but the diamonds sound lovely.
- They're not - [groans] And then what's left of my body will be endlessly beaten with a titanium rod, like a Like a piÃ±ata.
Yes, except you have the string around my waist, but instead it will definitely be around my genitals.
- What? - Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to honor you.
Please, allow me to reconceive the event.
Of course.
All right, everyone, we're starting over.
- [popping] - No, not by using them.
No, Jianyu.
Done.
[popping continues] He's gonna be tortured? Dang it.
I was almost handed a perfect solution to all my problems without having to work for it at all, and now it's gone.
[sighs] Why do bad things always happen to mediocre people who are lying about their identities? Okay, you have two options.
You can confess and save Michael, or you can continue to lie and condemn him to an eternity of unimaginable pain.
Or option C continue to lie about myself and find a way to save Michael.
[quietly] Three birds.
No, there's no way to stop this except confessing.
Any moment now, Michael is going to get on that train, and we will never see him again, just like Professor Lindeman after I asked him to reread my 3,600-page manuscript.
He said he was going out for cigarettes, but then he just left his tenured position at the Sorbonne.
Great story.
Janet? - [bell chimes] - Hi, there.
Hi.
So the only way out of the neighborhood is a train? That's correct.
[laughs] One more question, and, um, this is a little weird, but can we uh, shut you down? Yes, great question.
There is a kill switch in a remote sector of the neighborhood in the event that I malfunction and attempt to harm the residents.
If you press it, I will be destroyed.
- Anything else? - No, that's good, thanks.
- Okay.
- Whoa, you want to kill Janet? Michael can't retire if he can't leave.
He can't leave if there's no Janet to run the train.
It's a perfect solution.
Killing is one of the most famous moral no-nos.
Janet is a nonhuman object who was sent here to help us, and the way she can help us is if we kill her.
We're doing one small murder-y thing for a bigger, better reason.
The ends justify the means.
Do you know who said that? Was it someone nice and great, like Oprah? It was Machiavelli - [sighs] - A very non-Oprah-like figure.
And what happens after we kill her? We'll have to lie to everyone about what we did, and lying is always wrong.
[groans] Why? Why would I tell Henry that I liked his boots? I don't like his boots.
I hate his boots.
I lied to him.
You wrote your thesis on Kant.
He believed that lying is always morally wrong no exceptions.
Yes, well, Kant was a lonely, obsessive hermit with zero friends.
Sometimes we do thing just to be polite, but if you really feel that strongly about it, tell him the truth.
Also, I don't care, 'cause it's the middle of the night.
[sighs] This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
They do? Hey, Chidi.
Thanks, bud.
It's actually perfect that you are here.
I got something for you.
Oh, my God.
You loved mine so much, I decided to get you your own pair.
We can be boot brothers.
Wow.
I can't accept these.
Try 'em on, mate.
The fact that you liked mine so much really made me feel like I made the right choice to buy them.
After all, why should I have all the fun and boots, eh? I-I don't I don't know.
Those look great.
Take 'em for a spin.
- [groans] - You're flying.
Mm, thanks.
Speeches! Time for speeches, everyone.
I shouldn't have been.
I was the problem.
Yes, but it was also great when you weren't there.
Don't worry.
Soon I won't be forever.
Because of The Eternal Shriek! Yes, thank you, Glenn.
Look, what I'm trying to say is this Michael, you always kept us warm and safe like a bright, glowing sun.
Like the one I kicked the dog into or the one I'm going to be burned on the surface of for eternity? Okay, no more speeches.
Ugh, I'm sorry I was so grumpy.
It's just I'm sad that I have to leave before doing all the human things that I wanted to do.
I wanted to get my hair wet.
You know, I-I wanted to pull a hamstring.
To learn the difference between "toward" and "towards.
" I wanted to do that thing where you walk down the hallway, and someone else is walking the other way, and then you both lean to one side and then the other, and then you both chuckle over your shared foible.
I wanted to get a rewards card, any rewards card.
I-I wanted to talk briefly to someone and then say, "Take it sleazy.
Here, try this.
[crunching] Pretty dry and too salty.
Well, going out on a real low note here.
Okay, bye, everyone.
Well, take it sleazy.
You got to say it? Yes, but then you say it back.
No, it's not organic.
[somber music] Uh, Janet, how many "Janets" have there been? There have been 25 generations of Janet.
So it's like aging for a human? You're you're growing up? That's how I like to think of it, Chidi.
I can't eat, so every time there's a new version of Janet, I like to take a piece of birthday cake and smash it around where my mouth is.
[sighs] Look, Janet has has learned and grown.
She's essentially living a life.
We can't kill her.
Not with that attitude, we can't.
Listen, man, I'm dead, you're dead, we all died, and now we're killing her.
Pay it forward.
Just press that button, and it's good-bye, Janet.
[groans] Chidi, I can see that you're worried, and I just want to assure you, I am not human, and I cannot feel pain.
Ah, thank you.
That helps.
However, I should warn you I am programmed with a fail-safe measure.
As you approach the kill switch, I will begin to beg for my life.
It's just there in case of an accidental shut down, but it will seem very real.
Cool.
[sighs] Okay, here we go.
Chidi, no, no, no! Chidi, please! Please, please, please don't hurt me.
I don't want to die! Please, please Ah! Again, I am not human.
I can't die.
I am simply an anthropomorphized vessel of knowledge built to make your life easier.
You're pleading seems so real.
Oh, yes, it is a very effective fail-safe.
Ugh, you want a robot killed right, you have to do it yourself.
Eleanor, I have kids.
I have three beautiful children Tyler, Emma, and little, tiny baby Phillip.
Look at Tyler.
Tyler has asthma, but he is battling it like a champ.
Look at him.
No, Eleanor, look at them.
Look at them! [growling] Look at them! Aah! It's so realistic! Eleanor, again, I'm not human.
This is a stock photo of the crowd at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.
- Right.
Please, I have so much to live for.
- No, no, no, please.
- We're not even near the Hey, guys, what's going on? That party was lame, so I bailed.
Then I saw you, so I followed you here.
- Oh, look, a button.
- No, no, no! Jianyu, no! [dramatic music] [powering down] Ah, man, I wanted to push that button.
Not cool, dude.
I-I-I killed her.
Not killed.
Remember, Janet was not a living being, so she can't be killed.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention What do we do, Eleanor? What do we do? Chidi, you just murdered Janet.
- Sorry, Janet! - I have been murdered.
Attention I have Attention I have been murdered.
Okay, dude, crash course in getting away with bad stuff.
You have to act calm and cool like you don't have a care in the world.
Okay? Great.
Oh, wow.
Look, it's "Weekend at Bernie's," 'cause you're a dead guy in sunglasses.
[laughs] We have fun, don't we, Chidi? I've never been more stressed out in my entire life.
You killed Janet.
[somber music] Well, Janet's been murdered.
That's a nice capper to this wonderful day.
I don't really know what happens now because Janet has never been murdered before only today, here on my watch, while I was distracted with a party that Tahani was throwing for me, which I didn't want.
Michael, you mustn't blame yourself.
I'm not.
I'm blaming you.
Anyway, what is there to say about Janet that hasn't already been said by the giant Janet alarm in the sky? "I've been murdered"! I think that says it all.
Uh, what is it? Uh, what is it? What is it? Um oh, right, right, right! It's my, uh my birth year.
Uh [grunts] I got to change that.
That's too easy to guess.
Janet who murdered you? - Oh.
Oh, no.
- Shh, okay.
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.
Okay - Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Everyone, um, until I get to the bottom of this, my retirement is officially postponed.
- Whoo! - [applause] - [laughs] - Oh, oh.
Hello.
Hello.
J-Dog, you cool? No, by the time I got to the piÃ±ata, all the candy was gone.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
Chidi? Cheedster? What's, uh, happening, buddy? You have a crazy look in your eye, and you're retreating into your shirt.
You're kind of turtling.
Henry, are you all right? What happened? I have an aneurysm.
Requires emergency surgery.
Doctor's give me a 50/50 chance.
So, if there's anything you need to say to me, you should do it now.
I love you, too, boot brother.
Okay.
[soft music] Chidi! You didn't have to stay here all night.
So surgery went well? All clear? Right as rain, buddy.
That is so, so, so great.
- I hate your boots.
- What? I told you that I loved your boots three years ago, and I was lying, and that lie has haunted me ever since, and people tried to tell me it was fine just a nice, little white lie in the form of social niceties but I disagreed, and then yesterday I thought you were gonna die, but now you're not dead, and I can finally be honest and say that those boots are terrible and hideous and I hate them.
Whoo! This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
I don't care that she came back or that we did it for a good reason.
I can't live with this lie.
I'm going to confess to the murder of Janet.
[laughs] What? Dude, why? Janet is fine.
We didn't harm her at all.
We didn't? Hey, Janet? - [bell chimes] - Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
She literally knew everything in the universe, and now she's a baby.
And even if she were okay, it would be too painful for me to live with these lies.
What are you talking about? It is so easy to live with a lie.
I once pretended to have a terminal illness to meet Scott Wolf at a Sunglass Hut.
Victimless crime.
Fine.
I won't say anything because I promised to help you, - and the moral implications - [sighs] Of everything that we've done are so complicated that I may never untangle them, but I hate lying.
I always have, and this is going to eat me up inside forever.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Jianyu! Michael, Janet said you wanted to speak to me.
Well, actually, she was just drooling a lot and saying "hello" over and over again, but she did point at you.
I owe you an apology.
Oh, no.
You were only trying to help.
You're a wonderful person, and if I ever do have a retirement party, I hope you plan it.
[chuckles bashfully] [sighs] Thank you for gathering, everyone.
I want to keep you all updated.
Here's what we know.
Someone slaughtered Janet.
Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.
It also means that the problems in this neighborhood are not 100% my fault.
There is something else at work here.
If anyone has any information about any of this, I beg you, tell me.
[breathing deeply] Hey, I love you, man.
Michael the problem in the neighborhood is me.
[all gasp] I was brought to the Good Place by mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
[dramatic music]
Good to see you, too, bud.
I am just dumbfounded as to how this happened.
Our system has never made a mistake before It's just not possible.
And yet, here we are.
First things first, who are you? Well, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop, and some of the info you had was right.
I mean, "flattened by boner pill truck after dropping margarita mix in grocery store parking lot," that's a very me way to die.
But all the other info was wrong.
In my defense, when I first arrived, and you said, "You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead, and you're in the Good Place," I had no reason to think that was a mistake.
So sorry, that's what I used to tell people when I lied about my age.
I was born in 1982.
You lied so much, you forgot your own birthday.
Not a great start, but it should be enough for Janet to locate your file.
- Janet? - [tone chimes] - Janet - What's that? What's that? [gasps] What's this? Her memory's still being rebooted because, oh, you know, someone murdered her.
Janet, could you please locate the file for an Eleanor Shellstrop, born in - [sighs] 1982? - Yes.
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
- Sure.
Whee! Since Janet can't retrieve your file, I need to find another way to determine what kind of person you were.
This is a quick litmus test.
Handful of questions designed to tell whether you are fundamentally good or bad.
Question number one: Did you ever commit a serious crime, such as murder, sexual harassment, arson, or otherwise? No.
Did you ever have a vanity license plate, like "MAMASBMW," "LEXUS4LIZ," or "BOOBGUY"? No.
Did you ever reheat fish in an office microwave? Ew, no.
Have you ever paid money to hear music performed by California funk rock band "The Red Hot Chili Peppers"? No.
Did you ever take off your shoes and socks on a commercial airline? And socks? Ew, who would do that? People who go to the Bad Place, Eleanor, that's the point.
Oh, gosh, you said "water"? - Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.
- [tone chimes] - There you go.
Ahh.
I really do have sympathy for your situation.
I mean, you thought your soul mate was a good person, and then you learned that she's just an immoral grifter.
- Tahani, please.
- Am I wrong? She lied to everyone.
She well, she pretended to be my friend when I really needed one.
And, lest we forget, she murdered Janet.
As far as I'm concerned, the sooner she's gone, the better off we'll all be.
I I understand that Eleanor violated our trust, but please, when you're talking to Michael, try to think about what she's had to go through.
All right.
I will, for you.
But we've been through a lot as well.
You know, I haven't been this upset since my good friend Taylor was rudely upstaged by my other friend, Kanye, who was defending my best friend, BeyoncÃ©.
You did very well on the questionnaire, Eleanor.
So far, so good.
- [tone chimes] - Michael, good news.
I was able to obtain Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
[sighs] Is it actually a cactus? - I don't understand.
- I want to see the file for Eleanor Shellstrop.
Is that what you have, or do you have a cactus? - I have the file.
- You're sure? You have the file and not a cactus? That is correct.
Excellent.
Please, give me the file.
- Here you go.
- [tone chimes] Thank you, Janet.
- You're welcome.
- [tone chimes] Well, I say we call it a day.
I mean, I nailed the questionnaire, and you're swimming in cacti.
Can't we just chalk this up to a hilarious mistake and move on? No, we can't, Eleanor.
I mean, you're a giant chunk of spinach in the teeth of the universe.
I need to understand every facet of this disaster.
Tell me a lie about yourself.
- Any lie.
- I love the opera.
[low tone] And now a truth.
I love Women's MMA.
[bright tone] We don't like to use this.
[bright tone] Do you know who did? Yes.
[bright tone] Will you tell me who it was? No.
[bright tone] I assume it was one of your friends, and I admire you for protecting him or her.
But Eleanor, in the Good Place, there's no room for bad people or bad actions, so anyone involved in the murder of Janet will be reviewed and judged, and there will be consequences.
Tahani, come on in.
Chidi.
Imposter who soiled our paradise with her moral turpitude.
'Sup? Thank you for confessing, I don't know what I would - have done if you hadn't - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Michael knows I didn't kill Janet which means it's only a matter of time before he finds out that you did and that you did it because you were trying to stop Bonehead Jones over here.
Hey, homies! Then he'll figure out that Jianyu's also a phony, and, here's the real dong-buster, Michael said anybody who did anything bad might have to go - Ohh - Which means Jianyu's gone, you might be gone, and all three of us are royally forking forked! This is terrible.
What am I supposed to do if he asks me? I don't know.
Kant would say that lying in any scenario is wrong, so if Michael asks you if you killed Janet, you should say yes.
On the other hand, snitches do get stitches.
That is true.
I read that once on the back of my boy Peanut's tricep.
You just casually cited Immanuel Kant.
Tahani, I'll get right to the crux of the matter.
Did you murder Janet? Absolutely not.
[bright tone] Now, you spent a lot of time with Eleanor.
Why do you think that is? Well, people are just drawn to me.
You know, one of my shyest friends, I won't say his name to preserve his privacy, but he found my presence so comforting that he asked me to co-host his TV show "Anderson Cooper 360.
" [bright tone] Given what you learned about Eleanor, do you think she deserves to be here? Well You know, if it were up to me, I might find a way to look past her, um deficiencies, but it's not up to me, is it? There are some criteria that she unfortunately just didn't meet in her time on Earth.
So you think that I should send her to the Bad Place? Well, I didn't say that, but is her staying here unfair to those who earned their place? It sounds like you want her to leave.
Well, is it not she who wants us to leave her? Thank you, Tahani.
He's gonna call you in there in a second.
Don't worry, I got you.
I'll just tell Michael you're the bomb and that you got a dope soul and hella ethics.
Oh, boy.
No, don't say any of that.
Michael has a lie detector in there.
It's a it's a glowing cube.
Like the AllSpark? From "Transformers"? Sure, uh, just like the AllSpark from "Transformers," and and he'll know instantly if you're lying about anything so only smiles and nods, got it? Wise sage, centered Jianyu.
Your devotion to the noble truths has given you something that I don't have: clarity.
It was Buddha who said, "The man lives a pure life.
Nothing can destroy him.
" I'm not a man, and I've lived no life, so will this destroy me? Ouch.
Oh, of course.
A cactus on its own intends no harm.
It's only when we interfere that it becomes dangerous.
I need to remember my own agency here.
Oh, yes, of course.
Help yourself.
I've got plenty of those.
Chidi, come on in.
- [tone chimes] - Hi there.
I have Eleanor's file.
Janet, if you hand me a cactus, - I swear I will lose my mind.
- [tone chimes] Oh, yes! All right, here we go.
This file contains a compendium of all of the highest impact events from your life, that's the, uh, biggest positive and negative point swings.
So "Little Julie," who's that? Julie is my cousin's daughter.
Her mom is kind of a mess, so I used to take her to the mall sometimes and bought her churro dogs.
It's a hot dog, but the bun is two churros.
And it's tied together with a Slim Jim.
It's an Arizona delicacy.
Oh, sounds awful, but it's very nice that you made that girl happy.
So what's this: "Kool Threadz, "Glendale, Arizona's Premiere T-Shirt Emporium"? Uh, can we skip around and and circle back? How about I tell you more about those churro dogs.
Eeeh, okay.
I'll tell you, but it doesn't make me look great, so don't judge me.
That's literally the purpose of this entire exercise.
Okay, to understand this, you have to know about my roommate, Madison.
She was terrible.
Hey, Mads, um, I have to go to this stupid work party tonight.
Can I borrow your peach dress? Aww, that's a hard no, babe.
That dress is like twice your salary.
[soft piano music] [fabric tears] [sighs] Well, that's that's not great, but I assume you confessed and paid to fix it.
Not exactly.
Hey, losers, I'm going out.
Can you zip me? Dude, that dress is hella ripped.
- What? - [laughs] Oh, that stupid dry cleaner! Well, that's the risk you take when you keep - your clothes clean.
- My mom's a lawyer.
Those asswipes are gonna pay.
She sued for $900 for the dress and $80 million in emotional distress.
Wait, this story's about t-shirts.
There's more, isn't there? A little.
Check this out.
Somebody put the dry cleaners' story online, and it went viral.
Madison's famous.
The "Dress Bitch"? Yikes.
[laughs] Serves her right.
Madison is psycho.
Yeah, her fault.
That works.
[door opens] You guys, what is happening? Someone egged my Lexus, and I have like 40,000 tweets calling me the "Dress Bitch"? Over a loser dry cleaner man? Why is everyone so jealous of me? This is a trash city full of idiots.
[laughs] The "Dress Bitch" is so catchy.
- Yeah.
- I mean, someone could totally make t-shirts.
Ooh No, no.
No.
I really do.
Guuurl, check it out! They're here.
Wait a second.
Is this insane? I mean, should we be doing this? Dude, Madison brought this on herself, okay? She's a nightmare of a person to everybody.
Plus, we already have a ton of pre-orders.
Here is your first cut of the profits.
Holy mama.
I can't believe you sold the t-shirts.
Thanks, babe.
Next question.
Eleanor.
Given what you know about the people who've been brought here, the lives they've led, do you think you belong in the Good Place? No, I don't.
[bright tone] - [beep] - Yello, Bad Place.
What's up, dummy? This is Michael, the architect from Good Place Neighborhood 12358W.
I'm guessing you've been looking for someone called Eleanor Shellstrop.
She's here.
Hey, there he is.
Good to see you again, Mikey.
Hey, think fast, I brought you something.
Oh, nuts, thank you.
Oh! [laughter] Oh, flaming snake ate all the nuts you brought me.
[groans] You're too nice to humiliate.
Oh, hello.
Hi, you look like a piece of crap, are are you Eleanor? Dude, you're like a legend in the Bad Place.
No, we're stumped, but, uh, don't sweat it, champ.
She's definitely one of ours.
So we'll just roll on out, and you can get back to, uh, putting rainbows up your butt or whatever you do here.
Okay? Let's hit it, sweetheart.
We got a long ride.
What? Right now? Trevor, for decency's sake, let her have some good-byes.
[groans] God, good people are the worst.
Okay, uh, 30 minutes.
I just want to say, once more, for the record, that this whole good/bad system is bullshirt.
There should be a medium place for people like me who kind of sucked, but in, like, a fun, chill way.
I agree.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
And that I never did laundry.
And that I waited until you were about to do yours then secretly tossed mine into the basket to trick you into doing it.
You didn't trick me.
I repeatedly asked you to stop.
[knocking] What are you guys doing here? Well, we only thought it was proper to see you off.
It's the neighborly thing to do.
You guys came to say good-bye because you're my friends.
Well, I suppose some part of me possibly has a sense of casual kinship with you.
Much as one might be fond of a street cat.
Thanks, Tahani.
Sorry about everything.
I'm really glad we're friends.
Trying to improve her.
Bold plan, bro.
Well, actually, she learned a great deal in - a very short amount of time - Oh, really? Really? I don't care.
All right, let's hit it.
Oh, also, you should smile more.
You have such a pretty smile.
Love you, babe.
Can't wait to torture you.
Oops.
You just thought about it.
- Michael - Oh, hi, Chidi.
Want some pizza? Bad Place crew delivered a hundred of these to my office.
All Hawaiian, the worst pizza.
Michael, I murdered Janet.
I knew about Eleanor from the beginning.
I've been trying to help her become a better person, and when she found out that your retirement meant that you would be tortured, she immediately tried to find a way to prevent it.
I did enjoy her company.
But, this is not Little League.
There is no award for Most Improved Player, Chidi.
Well, maybe there should be.
One final note: the dining car is at the very back of the train.
It serves only room-temperature Manhattan clam chowder, and also, it's closed.
Okay, here we go.
[train chugging] Michael: Stop this train! [train screeching] Dude, what the fork? You're not leaving.
Come on.
Wait, you want to keep her? Bro, that's our girl.
We agreed on this.
No, what we agreed on was that this was a mistake.
Trevor, we're in unchartered territory here.
Until we can sort this out, she stays with us.
Pff, all right, fine, but until this is resolved, we're keeping the other Eleanor.
Fine.
Eleanor, come on out.
Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
[suspenseful music]
 I see trees of green Red roses too I see them bloom Hey, dingdongs.
We figured out what's happened here.
You two are both named Eleanor Shellstrop.
The day you died, you were both in Phoenix, Arizona shopping at the same grocery store.
Pffft.
" Incredibly, you both died in the same 10,000ths of a second in the same traffic accident because Real Eleanor was trying to save Fake Eleanor's life by pushing you out of the way of the truck.
I guess you really botched that one, eh? I did, and I am so, so sorry.
It's all good.
So how did you not realize you had the wrong Eleanor? Oh, we don't know what people look like only names and profiles.
On Earth, they're just dots on a map.
Whatever, we got our wires crossed, we picked up the wrong dot, blah, blah, blah, blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Point is, there are two Eleanors.
The nice, boring one is yours.
And also I'm still waiting on - that smile, gorgeous.
- Trevor.
- Where's that smile? - Trevor, how about we negotiate? Maybe give you something else.
What in the world could you have that we would want? All right, how about a unicorn? Right? I bet you don't have one of those.
No, that is true, yeah.
- [laughs] - Might be fun to skin it alive, eat its raw flesh, maybe break off the horn, grind it up, snort it.
Okay, let's keep talking.
Yeah.
" Sorry, it just makes things easier.
Look, I'm not even sure how it would work for you to stay here now that we know there's a real Eleanor, but in the meantime, stay on your toes.
Don't let Trevor get inside your head.
Can I ask you something? Why are you helping me? Well, Chidi made a very good argument on your behalf, but it's more than that.
I truly believe that the Good Place is where you belong.
You're part of our team.
Hi! Oh, you must be the new student Eleanor Shellstrop.
I'm Gloria, the senior class secretary.
Why don't I give you a tour after lunch? Yeah, no thanks, moptop.
Uh, sorry? Don't need your help, don't wanna sign your yearbook in, like, gel pen, don't wanna bedazzle our college essays, or whatever.
I'm here for like six months, and I'm gonna fly solo.
Beat it, Gloria.
She is, like, such a dork.
She, like, loves this school so much.
Why don't you come sit with us? We'll teach you which guys are cute and which teachers are secretly pervs, and Yeah, that's a hard pass as well.
I don't wanna get chunky highlights, make fun of nerds, and steal your mom's flavored vodka.
I'm Eleanor, I'm new here, and as a blanket statement for everyone: I don't wanna be a part of whatever little group you've formed because they're all equally lame.
Everybody cool? Great.
Hey, that was really cool, the way you told - all those poseurs - No.
Michael, welcome.
How can I help you? Well, if I'm going to save Fake Eleanor, I need some help negotiating.
I don't even know what to offer.
I mean, what do you get somebody who wants to eat a unicorn? A unicorn bib, yes! No, no, uh, unicorn holders, you know, like like, corn holders, but for unicorns? Perhaps, it'd be better if we just move away from the unicorn thing altogether.
[sighs] No, you're right, you're right.
I'll show you.
Bad Janet? - [tone] - What? Bad Janet, uh, where is the nearest cafÃ©? Oh, um, that's a good question.
It's up your mom's butt, you fat dink.
- [tone] - What is even the purpose of a Janet who behaves in such a manner? Unclear, but the the point is I never have to deal with negative emotion of any sort.
I could use some backup, Tahani.
Oh, Michael, of course.
Why don't you just bring them all here? Surely this magnificent house will placate them.
Oh, perfect, perfect.
It's beautiful I love Icelandic primitive design.
I kind of wish it had a clown nook, oh There it is.
Here's the bedroom.
It's kind of hard to get up on this dumb ledge though, it's like [beep] [heavenly music] [gasps] You have got to be forking kidding me.
Hey, Fake Eleanor, we used this same clown painting to decorate the room you were supposed to live in down there.
I swear to Bieber.
Wait, what was your house like? Well, I was living in what I assume is Eleanor's worst nightmare.
Every day was basically one endless baby shower for a woman I didn't know, but also somehow I had to organize it.
And then at night, it was pretty classic torture.
Uh, flying piranhas, lava monsters, college improv, and there was always jazz music playing.
Ugh, I hate jazz.
Every jazz song is like 40 minutes long.
It's like, we get it.
You can blow on a trumpet.
Wrap it up, Elton John.
Famously a piano player.
Yeah, we'll all go.
Perfect double date: Two losers, a trash bag, and a demon.
Let's hit it.
Eeh! [laughs] [classical music] All right, Michael, we're going to ply them with delicious food and drink, and then we're going to subtly segue into negotiation.
They're sure to be in a good mood.
Everything is absolutely beautiful.
This sucks, dude.
Yeah, this food, uh, blows.
Oh, huh, gimme some jalapeÃ±o poppers.
Sure, quick question: what is a "jalapeÃ±o"? Also: what is a "poppers"? Also: what is "jalapeÃ±o poppers"? Oops, sorry, guys.
Uh, see, in the confusion, Janet got rebooted, so she hasn't quite uploaded all of the info she usually knows.
[laughter] That's hilarious.
She's almost as stupid as people.
Oh, hey now, come on.
Let's not insult people, please.
[as Michael] Uh, I'm Michael, - I love, uh, idiot humans! - [laughter] I gotta admit that does sound like me.
- [laughter] Go get me a drink.
Yes, of course.
Aw, man, this is gonna make a primo dump later on.
Well, that looks delicious.
What is that? Oh, it's Tom Yum Goong soup.
It reminds me of when I was in Thailand rescuing victims of human trafficking.
Ooh, that sounds so good.
I mean, um, the soup, not the human trafficking.
She's like a perfect ball of light, and you're like a wet pile of mulch.
Someone made a person out of wet mulch and leaves and, like, dead slugs, and that's you.
Whatever, it's easy when you're just born perfect.
My parents were both dirtbags who split up when I was eight.
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but did you say your parents got a divorce? Yeah, and that kind of thing really changes a person.
I mean, that trauma It can explain away a lot of behavior.
Oh, of course.
Your parents are still together, I guess.
They put me in an empty fish tank and abandoned me at a train station in Bangladesh.
- [groans] - Luckily, I was found and adopted by a very nice couple, the Shellstrops - Oh, thank God.
- But then they died when I was four bird flu.
- That's awful.
- Anyway, orphanage burned down, yadda yadda yadda, made my way to America, yadda yadda yadda, learned English from watching "Seinfeld," put myself through law school, and here I am.
Huh.
And, I'm sorry, what What is it you said happened to you? The same thing that happens to half of all kids in America? [laughs] And for you to have gone through all that, and to end up where you did, it is just It's just amazing.
Oh, man, these horndogs are vibing like mofos.
[laughs] Yeah, that wine's no good.
I'm sending it back.
Hey, Janet.
You look sad.
People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answers to.
That was my whole life on Earth.
You know, it doesn't matter if you know things.
All that matters is what's in your heart.
Jianyu, I know usually you ask me questions, but can I ask you a question? Sure.
What are jalapeÃ±o poppers? Oh, I know this one! Okay, they're deep fried jalapeÃ±os filled with cheese.
- Hm.
- One time, at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Jacksonville, but the nice one, not the one above the gas station, I ate 50 of them in two minutes.
Everyone at the hospital was so impressed.
Got it.
Thanks, Jianyu.
You're welcome.
[light music] Anyone up for a little, uh, icebreaker? You know, I once did trust falls with Barry Diller, and it was the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
And then once we trust each other, then we can discuss making a deal for Fake Eleanor.
This sucks.
How do you guys eat without listening to hard-core porn? Oh, come on, this is the Good Place, you can do anything you want.
What about throwing a rager and totally trashing this place? Whoo-hoo, yeah, I'd be into that.
Mm, we could totally go to town.
You know, I actually don't think that's such a good idea.
Let's party! Who let the dogs out? - Who who who who? - Oh, my God! Who let the dogs out? Who who who So, um, Chidi tells me that he's teaching you about ethics.
Let's cut to the chase here You two go to Poundtown? Poundtown, bro.
You two bang it out? She hot for teach? Did you pork the dork? C'mon, girl, dish me dem dirty deets.
I assure you, our relationship was "teacher-student," nothing more.
Chidi, you don't have to explain anything to me.
Whatever happened before I arrived is none of my business.
Hey, I'd love to see the rest of the neighborhood.
Uh, yes, it's it's incredible.
Um, there's an amazing library, there's a beautiful, - piranha-free lake.
You guys go ahead.
You'd rather be alone with him? Fire in the hole watch your heads, ladies.
My dudes tend to boomerang around the room.
Yeah, I mean, I don't need to walk around and nerd out about old books.
I'm good.
Okay.
Hey, a bunch of us are gonna go see "Spider-Man 2" tonight.
Do you want to come? They made a second "Spider-Man"? What is there left to say? Sure, whatever, I'm in.
- No, it's just so we can all get tickets before they sell out.
Do you want to buy them? So you guys can never pay me back, and I'll be out like 80 bucks? Nice try.
I'll buy my own ticket.
The rest of the group can do whatever they want.
Where did she end up? Bought it with points, baby.
My points.
I think I need to find a new place to live.
- [electronic music] - Oh no, no, no, no.
[sighs] Want a bump? No, thank you, I I don't use cocaine.
Oh, it's not cocaine, idiot.
We're snorting time.
Sorry you're snorting the concept of time? Yeah, it'll fork you up.
Yo, monk dude, you know how to tap a keg? - Karaoke time! - Whoo! Dana, baby, what do you wanna do? Okay, Mussolini's speech? Ooh, the Mel Gibson rant? - That's a classic.
- Classic Ooh, let's do - the Nixon Tapes that's my jam! - Yeah! [in Nixon's voice] "What you always have to "remember about the Irish is they get mean.
"Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean - when he drinks.
" - [cheering] Whoo! Michael, tell them to stop.
Dance.
You got it.
[in Nixon's voice] "Oh, it's about damn time that the Jew in America realizes he's an American first and a Jew second.
" [laughs] I lighted him on fire, and he never spoke again.
You know, maybe I'm not as great as Real Eleanor, but I'm better than I used to be.
I'm medium-good.
Why haven't you forkers invented a medium place? Look, I know you've been trying to become a "better person," I mean, you didn't want to get caught.
I get it.
You once saw a meter maid writing you a ticket, and you barked like a dog till she ran away.
I mean, honestly, you'll be happier in the Bad Place.
I mean, don't get me wrong, you'll be miserable.
We will torture you, but you'll also be happier because you won't have to keep trying to fit in somewhere you just don't belong.
[sighs] A'ight.
Let's go.
Okay, hold on, I have to ask: is this thing gonna happen? - You and me? - Ew, no, gross.
Okay, you know I had to ask, babe.
I don't care about the house, Michael.
I'm just upset that you let them walk all over you.
I know they're the only thing in the Universe that scares me.
I know what I have to do.
I just have to be more accommodating.
Offer them everything they want, give in to all of their demands, and then they'll have to respect me.
No, you need to stand up for yourself.
I'm going to tell you the same thing that I told Mark Zuckerberg right before he ousted Eduardo Saverin.
Just "Facebook.
" That was me.
[coughs] [spits] [groans] Oh Oh, my head.
Here, drink this.
How am I hung over? I thought there were no hangovers here.
Well, the Bad Place Crew requested the hangover filter be turned off.
They like them.
So, Michael said we're meeting at Tahani's place in an hour for a negotiation session.
Just hang out with Real Eleanor and name constellations after each other, or whatever it is nerds do.
I'm fine on my own.
Yeah, Eleanor, just because we have a new guest in the house doesn't mean I'm not still gonna be there for you.
I'm in this.
We're a team.
So you've been temping for us for a year now, and we want to bring you aboard permanently.
We think you'd be a great addition to the team.
Yeah, no.
You're all obsessed with this place, man.
You love working here and talking about working here, and you all hang out like some kind of cult.
We hang out after work because we're friends.
I know.
It's weird.
If this is how you really feel, I I think I have to fire you.
Severance pay.
Love it.
I get it, man.
Which one's my desk? That one, over there.
All you gotta do is hit your minimal sales target every week.
Cool.
And you guys don't have any lame, mandatory office hangouts, right? Hell no.
Some people go out for a drink after work, and I like to run the occasional group drill to see how fast we can shred evidence, but that's it.
Most days, you'll be able to avoid even talking to another person here.
Perfect.
All right, let's begin negotiations.
Now, we would like to discuss various trades that we could Oh, yeah, we're not negotiating.
See, Fake Eleanor and I, we bro-ed down pretty hard last night.
We hooked up.
No, we didn't.
Yeah, but who are they gonna believe me or a woman? [laughter] Point is she knows that she doesn't belong here, and she's giving up.
Is this true? Fake Eleanor, are you giving up? Yeah, of course she is.
She knows this place isn't for her.
No, I'm not leaving.
Oh, come on, sweetheart, we've been through this.
You know you don't belong here.
You're right.
I don't But I want to.
I used to never want to be a part of any group, but I'm a different person now because of the person who helped me, and I want to be like him.
I want to be like all the people who are here.
You can, Eleanor.
Look, if you don't come with us, we're gonna have to turn this matter over to Shawn.
Oh, oh, no, um, Shawn, really? Wha uh, who's Who's Shawn? He's the wise, eternal Judge who sits on high, has the final say on all disputes between our two realms.
And his name is "Shawn"? Okay, look, I don't want Shawn involved either, so how about you blow us away with an offer so we can end this.
Okay Here's my offer.
You get nothing.
We're not letting Fake Eleanor go, and we're not giving you anything.
Get him, Michael! You can summon every evil creature you have, every weapon in your arsenal, every four-headed flying bear they have them down there but we are not giving up.
I believe that Eleanor belongs in the Good Place.
But she's staying here.
Now, all of you Get the fork out of my neighborhood.
[suspenseful music] [chuckles] You're on borrowed time, Fake Eleanor.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Let's roll, dummies.
Let's get one drink for the road.
- Bye.
- Did you guys hear any of that? - [collective sigh of relief] - Oh, my Bravo, Michael, really.
I found your junk food all over the house, and then, last night, you knew how to tap a keg.
So I thought I would come in here and investigate your little "meditation" den.
What I found was this.
Now, I don't know who you are, but I do know that you're not a Buddhist monk.
So let's chat, shall we?
 Number five is number one.
Number seven is number two.
Number three and number four are tied for number three.
No, it isn't.
You could tell me your real name, for starters.
My name is Jason Mendoza.
I'm from Florida.
And I'm a professional amateur DJ.
And is, uh, that a family member? I wish.
That's Ariana Grande, the sexiest woman alive.
You wish that you were related to a woman you want to have sex with.
You have some nerve asking me for favors when you have spent weeks deceiving me, making a fool out of me, and bringing snack food into my house.
Disgusting.
Oh, Ariana, we're really in it now.
Shawn, the judge, could show up at any moment, so we need to have a rock-solid argument for why Fake Eleanor should not be sent to the Bad Place.
- Should be fun.
- That's the spirit! Don't even think about the fact that our slightest misstep could cause Fake Eleanor to suffer for eternity.
That's all I'm thinking about now.
Yep, shouldn't have said that.
Um, ahem, could you please just say "Eleanor," and maybe point to whichever one of us you're addressing? Well, actually, the fake/real distinction helps me.
Oh, does it, Bambadjan? Now, I know a fair amount about your time on Earth.
Why don't you tell me about your time here? Anything that might help your case.
Well, in the first 24 hours, I caused the world to erupt into chaos, and then I caused a garbage storm.
It was kind of a rough start, but things calmed down after Chidi started helping me learn about ethics.
Okay, tell me about that.
Well, I studied with Chidi every day, and then Chidi got sick of me, so I did some nice stuff to make him feel better.
And later, I confessed because Chidi was being tortured by guilt, and I just felt awful seeing his little, nerdy face all contorted.
You know, a lot of death row inmates feel regret about things they never said admissions of guilt or anger or love.
Are you making a move on me? It's fine I just didn't see it coming.
Uh, well, hooking up with someone with the exact same name, it is kind of a fun, narcissistic fantasy - No, no, Eleanor, I I'm talking - I could be into it.
Mm, no, I'm talking about you and Chidi.
Now, ordinarily, you having feelings for my soul mate would be - a conflict of interest - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think I'm into Chidi? Yes, Eleanor, I do.
Because you are.
You mentioned his name nine times in the last ten minutes.
Shall we start with the Greeks or would you prefer the modern British masters? Chidi? I'm sorry, choices are hard for me when I'm under pressure.
I know that, buddy, but we're short of time here, and it's kind of important for Eleanor.
Right, which is why I can't take this lightly.
What if I screw up? Listen, I don't need the Chidi who once had a panic attack during Rock-Paper-Scissors because there were, and I quote, "just too many variables.
" I need the Chidi who stormed in here and told me to stop Eleanor's train without thinking of consequences.
Oh, boy, now I'm nervous about that decision.
Retroactively? I mean, h how do you even? I don't know.
Okay, we have so many big choices to make.
Chidi, just pick! Come on, Chidi, pick someone.
Don't pressure me, Uzo.
I have to consider all the factors.
Athletic strategies, the fragile egos of my classmates, and gender politics.
Should I pick a girl as a gesture towards women's equality, or or is that pandering? Or do I think it's pandering because of my limited male point of view? I'm vexed, Uzo, vexed.
You're always vexed.
Just pick.
Okay, fine, uh, I choose Tokunbo.
all: Come on, Chidi.
Just pick someone.
[bell rings] Congratulations, Chidi.
You filibustered recess.
[sighs] No, no, no, you're wrong.
There are way more things I hate about Chidi than like about him.
Like what? His stupid Clark Kent glasses, his extensive turtleneck collection, oh, and he loves ethics so much.
He once talked about John Rawls for two hours I timed it.
He always twitches his eyebrows when he says "absolutism," and he tilts his head whenever I say anything ignorant, but he never makes fun of me, which is nice.
He's also incredibly patient, and kind, and surprisingly jacked, and, oh, fork, I'm in love with Chidi.
Let's take a little break.
I know this is awkward, but as your advocate, and, I hope, friend, I think you should tell Chidi how you feel.
Would a hug make you feel better? - No, I don't think that it would - Oh, too late, you're getting one.
Thanks, Bambadjan, that does make me feel better.
Mm-hmm.
Yet another lie.
No, no, no, Chidi did it.
I got you an awesome painting, but then he switched it to this one because he said you'd like it more, and he made me memorize stuff to say to you so you wouldn't be so sad.
This is all his fault.
You should yell at him.
[scoffs] Chidi helped you make me happy.
It's almost as if he was trying to Oh, oh, my.
Of course.
This is the cool painting I made.
Wow.
[claps] Ethics team, how's it going? - Terribly.
- Cool.
Well, you guys are kind of my last hope, so that's not great.
- [groans] - Hey, do you mind if I borrow Professor Stomachache here for a second? Please, take him for an hour, take all the time you want.
Okay, sit down, maybe.
[clears throat] I dated many annoying guys, okay? They would call me all times of the day "just to talk" or ask me if I'd taken cash out of their wallets, stupid stuff.
And when I stopped having fun with them, I'd leave.
Gotta go spend that money you stole.
Point is, you are way more of a buzzkill than any of those dudes.
Okay, thanks for this conversation.
But, somehow, I never want to leave you.
I want to stay in the Good Place because of you.
Because I love you.
I think.
No, I'm pretty sure.
[laughs] I feel so itchy.
Sorry.
Don't say anything.
I just needed to get that off my chest.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Catch you later, silly Billy.
Ugh, love has made me a nerd.
Bye.
Just like your "soul mate.
" More importantly, you did the ballerina painting 'cause you were trying to protect my feelings, because you love me.
Oh, Chidi, don't you see? This is the real mistake that was made in our neighborhood.
You and I are soul mates.
It makes so much sense.
- Oh, but - No, Chidi, true love is rare, like a desert flower betwixt two oases, but true love's also very simple.
And right now, I'm just a girl towering over a boy asking him to admit he loves me.
I feel like her confession of love was a lot better than mine.
You have to [sighs] It looks calm now, but the storm is imminent.
- We're - What's up, Carson Daly? My name is Jason.
I wanna give a shout-out to all my homies up in Jacksonville.
I am not Carson Daly.
I'm a weather reporter.
A hurricane is coming.
You need seek shelter.
- I'm on TV! - Okay.
I'm trying to cheer myself up because I'm sad.
I think I might be in big trouble.
Can you bring me something that will make me not-sad? Let me think.
[beep] - [beep] - Sorry that took so long.
Here you go.
Oh, dang.
Are these from my favorite restaurant, Stupid Nick's Wing Dump? Stupid Nick's closed down because a pelican fell in the flash fryer, but he opened a new place called Ugly Nick's Meat Trench.
These are an exact replica of that recipe.
Janet? I just realized something.
I love you.
Okay.
I have one more question for you.
So you also love Chidi, and you you just told him, just now, right before I did? Technically, you told him that he loves you, but yes.
[sighs] This isn't ideal.
We must remain civil.
He's simply going to have to pick one of us, and the loser will just have to accept her fate with grace and equanimity.
Classy as always.
I suppose you knew that Jianyu was a fake, didn't you? Yes, I did.
Figured you two charlatans would sniff each other out like two mangy rats sharing a pizza crust in a sewer Okay no.
We're not gonna do this.
We are not gonna be those women who fight over a guy and find any excuse to rip each other apart.
I am not going to apologize for being angry.
You knew that my soul mate was lying to me.
Yes, I did, and I'm very sorry.
What would make you feel happy, right now? [with British accent] You have a fine home, Deirdre I absolutely adore your shares.
[with Cockney accent] I don't know bugger all about a shares I been using this as a bloody toilet, I have.
- [laughs] - What's this show called, again? It's "Deirdre and Margaret.
" It ran for 16 years on the BBC.
They did nearly 30 episodes.
It's about two women from very different worlds who become friends, sort of like us.
Oh, Deirdre, no! That's priceless art! I thought it was fruit, innit? [laughs] Deirdre.
I take it the moron is me? Well, it's not a direct parallel.
Are you ready to take our bonding to the next level? [light music] Oh, good, you're back.
Yeah, I, uh, I know we're short on time, but I need your help with a personal dilemma.
[sighs] This is about Fake Eleanor and Real Eleanor.
Yes, which person is my soul mate? Real Eleanor, that's what the system determined.
- Okay.
- Of course, the system did screw up by letting Fake Eleanor in.
You know, it's interesting.
Fake Eleanor being selected accidentally and then you bonding with her could have shifted the formula.
I mean, the system might be so screwed up at this point that maybe you don't belong to either Eleanor.
[tense music] Oh - You is spreading - What? Your indecisiveness is infecting me like a virus.
Oh, Chidi, this could send us down a very dangerous path.
If you can't make a choice, this whole neighborhood could fall apart.
Okay, getting close here.
Just mulling the ethical ramifications of various soups.
Ah, same old Chidi.
I can come back for a fifth time.
It has, it has.
Look, as you know, Ellen and I are engaged.
You're my oldest friend, and I love you like a brother, and that's why I'd like you to not be my best man.
- Sorry? - Look, if you were my best man, you'd have to plan the bachelor party, decide what to say in your toast, handle problems that pop up the day of.
It would drive you up the wall.
Well, Uzo, this isn't choosing soccer teams on a playground.
When something's important to me, I can make a decision.
Watch.
Perfect.
You kind of want to change your order.
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.
- Excuse me, Risotto.
Risotto? - Yeah.
As much as I'm enjoying this, shouldn't we be working on your case to try and stay here? Honestly, how am I gonna help them? They are much smarter than me.
Now, hair extensions? This is where I shine.
You were already at almost-maximum hotness, but now you look like a sexy, tan Rapunzel.
These were the ones I used, and they are real cheap.
You're gonna want to stay away from open flames and altercations at outlet malls.
[laughs] Hey I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you about Jianyu and that you got saddled with him.
Yes, that is regrettable, but I forgive you.
[laughs] Maybe you two are soul mates.
[both chuckle] [suspenseful music] Holy shirt.
Maybe we are.
I know it seems crazy, but but think about it: Jianyu is a hot dummy, definitely my type.
People come in pairs here, and if the system paired us up, then maybe somehow I do belong here with him.
- [beep] - Hi, there.
Jason and I are getting married in ten minutes, and you're invited.
[quirky music] Here, we've got your soul mate options: Eleanor, Real Eleanor, and a theoretical third person.
Let's call her strawberry mango twist.
Okay, close your eyes.
Think about each of the women.
Open your eyes.
Well, hang on, let me think about that.
- No, no.
- Because it No more thinking, Chidi.
Just do something.
Indecision caused you so much agony in your life, right up to the very end.
I had a little trouble writing my speech.
Um I wrote 11 different versions.
Wedding's in 20 minutes, buddy.
Is this air conditioner even working? Yes, it is.
You're just having a literal meltdown.
Also, you're not dressed yet, and we haven't picked up the rings.
Okay, well, uh, there's an issue there involving what I consider to be unfair labor practices - on the part of the jeweler.
- And we never had a bachelor party because you could never settle on a location or time.
I'm sorry, you were right.
This is too much for me.
You should just leave me here and go get married.
Oh, no.
No, I mean, I'm I'm relieved, but this is embarrassing.
It's okay, bud.
Obviously, I prepared for this.
Let's just go have a nice night.
I'll buy you a beer.
30 minutes, Chidi? We have been trying to pick a bar for 30 minutes.
It is literally impossible to be your friend.
I just need to make a decision.
I'm gonna look each of these women in the eye, trust my gut, and figure out how I feel.
You're kidding.
That worked? Great! Go do it! Ha! Man on speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to married.
[electronic music playing] Yo, check it.
[laughs] This is great.
At different moments during our time here, we both thought that Tragic Mike over here was our one true love, and now he is marrying whatever Janet is.
I suppose you're right.
"Janet, my digital queen.
"Janet, we can dare to dream.
Send nude pics of your heart to me.
" - [gags] - "Jacksonville Jaguars rule!" Jason, when I was rebooted, and I lost all my knowledge, I was confused and disoriented, but you were always kind to me.
And according to the central theme of 231,600 songs, movies, poems, and novels that I researched for these vows in the last three seconds, that's what love's all about.
Does anybody here object to this marriage? - Of course we do how could - Yes, it is a terrible idea.
- we not object? - Overruled.
- Jason? - Mm-hmm? Do you want me to be your wife? - Yeah.
- So, by the power vested in me, by me, I now pronounce us husband and wife.
- We did it! - [laughs] Can I kiss you, or will I be electrocuted? Only one way to find out.
Whoo, get some! Got get it, girl! I'm just going with it now.
[laughter] ["At Last" by Etta James playing] It's funny I was devastated when I found out that he wasn't my soul mate, but now I think I've dodged a bullet.
He's a simple man.
I once watched him eat electrical tape right off the roll.
He thought it was a Fruit by the Foot that had gone bad.
Thank you for being such a great friend to me today.
Eleanor, hey, I just wanted to see if you'd talked to Chidi.
Uh, yeah, I did.
I mean, you don't have to tell me what you said.
I just wanted to see if you're okay.
Oh, man, you are a good person.
I swear, if I had known you and Tahani and Chidi on Earth, I might have for real gotten into the Good Place.
Oh, hey, it's my three favorite yogurts.
Hey, um, about what happened earlier I've been kind of all over the place today.
Okay.
What? I do love you, but I think more in a best friend afterlife savior kind of way.
I'm not so much "hot for teacher" as I am "eternally grateful for semi-cute, surprisingly ripped teacher.
" Chidi, I also have to apologize.
It's just that when I found out that Jianyu wasn't my soul mate, I-I desperately needed something to keep me afloat, and, well, you were the nearest lifeboat, as it were.
And yes, we do have the sort of connection that only two highly educated, sophisticates could have, but it's not true love.
True love is what Janet and Jianyu have.
Yeah.
- [gasps] - Really? I I'll come too.
["Digital Get Down" by 'N Sync playing] Digital digital get down - Just you and me - What?
 Now, I'm about to show you some very sensitive information.
The final point totals each of you achieved for all your actions on Earth.
[ping] Whoa, your point total was crazy high, Eleanor.
[laughs] Oh, sorry, "Crazy High Eleanor" was my nickname in college.
I accidentally saw these point totals when Michael was fixing the sinkhole.
It gave me an idea.
But the judge will be here soon, and this is the best way to build our case.
Now, the average point total for a resident here is roughly 1.
2 million.
Right now, based on everything that you did on Earth, you have -4,008.
That's not great, but I'm gonna do nice things for every goober in this place until my point total is so high I can rub it in all their smug faces.
- [beep] - You just lost five points.
Hello! Hi, how are you? There has to be something bigger I can do than holding the door and waving.
There's no way every Walmart greeter is in the Good Place.
- Look, I know this is tedious, but holding a door for someone is three points, and if you do it for everyone in the neighborhood, then that's almost a thousand points for just a start.
Besides, all the big ticket items are impossible, I'm afraid.
It's not as if you could, you know, "sacrifice your life to save others" or "change the consciousness of a nation.
" Both of which I did, by the way.
Such fun.
Have a wonderful day.
This is pointless.
The ticker isn't even going up, and everyone's giving me the stink eye.
No, this is good.
Now that we know, we can actually do something about it.
And I am an expert at mediating conflict, like when my friends Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Baby had an issue with my other friend Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Yeah, I don't know what I love more about our morning hardboiled egg routine, the eggs or the routine.
[laughs] Um, actually, this morning, there's a little surprise in yours.
[gasps] "I love you.
" How cute.
I love you too, egg.
Ohh.
Well, that is something.
I know you've gone through a lot, and now I'm throwing this at you, but I just I had to tell you how I feel.
I love you.
No need to respond.
- Great.
- Well, at some point, you'll respond, right? I just meant no rush.
You wanna talk about eggs again? [laughs] Hmm, this isn't right.
No, that's not it.
We're married now, but we still haven't told your dad.
Once again, Michael is not my dad, and we shouldn't tell him.
If Michael finds out that we're married, then he'll know you're not Tahani's soul mate, and then he'll know that you're really Jason and not Jianyu.
He'd send you to the Bad Place.
Mm, I don't want to lose you, girl.
- I'm not a girl.
- But also, I'm tired of living a lie.
I want us to have the life we deserve.
[poignant music] Pillboi, let's talk big picture.
You know I love Jacksonville.
J-town.
It's easily one of the top ten swamp cities in northeastern Florida, but if we're gonna make it in the DJ game, we gotta get to Miami.
Miami's expensive.
We just don't got that skrilla, B.
I mean, I got ten bucks to my name, and I spent eight of it on this burrito, and the other two on guac.
Great idea! What if we get caught? We'll just get married so that no one can testify against us.
Dope.
Yo.
I got diarrhea.
I'll be right back.
Me too.
I'll race you.
[laughter] both: Best friends! Thank you all for participating in our focus group for Fake Eleanor.
- Oh, dear.
- All this cartilage and bone got tangled up in my hair, and its skin was all over my skin.
I didn't know where I ended and the turkey carcass began.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing.
My cafÃ© got destroyed by the giant frog, then I reopened it and it fell into the sinkhole.
Just like me, I fell in too.
Who else feels that Eleanor has ruined every moment of your existence since you arrived? Excellent.
I must confer with Eleanor for a tick, so please, just enjoy the lemonade and cookies.
The last moment they were happy was at my party.
We have to recreate that party.
We have to take them back to that night before I started affecting the neighborhood and give them a fresh start.
Yes, of course.
We must throw the perfect party, or else you'll be tortured by demons forever.
This will be the fourth most important party I have ever thrown.
Janet, there you are.
Some residents are complaining that you're not responding I'm sorry, what's going on? Is that a a wedding ring? Yes.
Is it that person? Jianyu, the man standing right there also wearing a wedding band? Dad we need to talk.
[tense music] I just want to make sure that I have this right.
Um Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk, but rather someone named Jason Mendoza, a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida.
I wasn't a failed DJ.
I was pre-successful.
And you two are married.
Hells yeah, homie.
We love each other.
- So I agreed.
- Love you too, babe.
Janet.
Please tell me how this could have happened.
Unclear.
As you know, each time I am updated, I accrue new knowledge and abilities.
My suspicion is that when I was rebooted, I bonded with Jason in a way that I have never bonded with anyone before.
I seem to have gained a new understanding of love.
Go to your void.
- Okay.
- [beep] - No, Janet, come back! - [beep] - Hi there.
- Go.
- Sure thing.
- [beep] - No! - Stop doing that.
- [beep] - Me? - Go! - Good-bye.
- Janet, come back.
[quirky music] That is Sachveer, and his problem with me is Oh, one of the giraffes tried to hump him.
[laughs] It's gonna be hard to keep a straight face tonight.
Hey, can I ask your advice on something? Are you sure, dude? Isn't there someone else better you could ask, like literally anyone else? Well, it's a sensitive matter, and you you do know me pretty well.
So here it is: Real Eleanor said she loves me.
Hey, man, nice pull.
She's a great person.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, we are soul mates, so I probably do love her, but then again, how do I know if my motivation is correct? Maybe I think I'm supposed to love her, but if I tell her that I love her for the wrong reasons, it won't mean anything.
- You think? - If this were some random person you hooked up with at a Diamondbacks game in the parking lot behind the port-a-potties not based on a real example I would say keep mulling, but this is your soul mate.
She's Universe-approved.
Tell her you love her.
[beep] Hey, your score just went up 20 points.
Yeah, 'cause I give great advice.
Now maybe you'll finally listen to me and take off those glasses.
We are in the afterlife, dummy, nature's Lasik.
Okay.
But, three months ago, he went into such a deep meditative state that he registered as dead, and when you died at that exact same moment, our system mistook you for him.
Perhaps because you share the exact same IQ.
- Cool.
- No, not cool.
He stopped learning at the age of seven.
Okay, so, now, this is sort of a quick litmus test, basic questions designed to tell whether you were fundamentally good or bad.
Number one: Did you ever commit a serious crime? Yes, I blew up a guy's speedboat after he sued me.
[ding] And I stole an old lady's fake leg once on a dare.
- [ding] Have have you ever paid money to hear music performed by California funk rock band the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Yo, the Chilis? I saw them in concert like 50 times.
- [ding] - I once got arrested trying to steal Flea's bass guitar.
[ding] Oh, that was another serious crime I committed.
I should have mentioned that earlier.
- [beep] - Is it just me, or am I acing this test? Oh, this is bad.
Oh, this is so, so bad.
Oh, I thought I had everything under control when I found Eleanor, but somehow you are you're so much worse.
No, don't don't touch Oh How does that still work? Everything's gonna be fine, homie.
What if it doesn't work? Hey, we thought of everything except for an alibi and an escape route, but we'll figure it out as we go.
You don't wanna over-think these things.
- I'm kinda freaking out here.
- Pillboi, I got you.
This plan is foolproof.
And when it's over, we can finally have the lives we deserve.
DiGiorno! I am a safe installer here to install-a da safe.
So just a-point to where the guacamole money is, and I'll-a install-a da safe-a in da, how you say, a-place? [phone dialing] Yeah, hi, we're being robbed.
We need to get married now.
I do, for always and forever.
I do! Eleanor, for an utter novice, you have thrown a lovely party.
Well, thanks, but it's not working.
Not one more point.
What the fork? Oh, look, Michael's here.
He can help.
Michael, would you do us the honor of saying a few words? I don't know that I'm in the right frame of mind.
You know, I'm great, heart of a champion, basically your muse, you get it.
[party chatter] Attention, everyone.
Michael would like to say a few words.
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you all here, mingling around with your various secrets.
Who really knows which of you are who you say you are? No way to know unless I pull your skeletons out, right? Okay.
Take her easy.
Yes, well said.
Did I use that word right? Eleanor Shellstrop.
[sparse applause] Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor.
Original flavor, not new and improved.
I know a lot of bad stuff has happened because of me, but I never meant to hurt you, so if I caused you any harm, I'm truly sorry.
That's nice, Eleanor, but I still crashed into a turkey carcass.
And I fell into a sinkhole.
And my dog got kicked into the sun.
What can you possibly say to us that'll make up for your actions? Pobody's nerfect? [chuckles] [chuckling spreads] "Pobody's nerfect"? That's hilarious.
- It's nerfect! [all laughing] [quirky music] Eleanor, great job tonight.
Have you checked the, uh, the ticker? I could really use some good news.
Okay.
[exhales] Gah, come on.
Well, the nightmare continues.
The nightmare continues.
How did this not work? There's no way to increase my point total because everything I'm doing is out of self-preservation.
- I don't understand.
It doesn't count.
Holy shirt.
I know what I have to do.
Okay, I am almost done with these personalized "I'm sorry" notes to everyone in the neighborhood.
I need you guys to deliver everyone their notes, along with those T-shirts.
Well, granted, these are hilarious, but how is this going to help? Just trust me.
I'm gonna get the points.
[quirky music] Oh, good morning, Dad.
Hey, um why don't you want me to see Janet? I'm a good guy.
All I want is to give Janet the life she deserves.
Janet is not built for human life, and I'm not sure you're much of a provider.
Do you even remember how you died? No, not really.
It's a little fuzzy.
You and your friend Pillboi were trying to rob a restaurant.
Pillboi! And then the cops showed up.
So the plan was to pretend to install a safe with your friend hiding inside it.
Sure.
Look, we found your buddy's plans.
We know he was the brains.
You were just an accomplice.
If you're lucky, you might get probation.
- Jason going to jail? - No, man.
Jason's dead.
He suffocated in that safe.
At least he died doing what he loved a bunch of whippits.
Now he's never gonna get the life he truly deserved.
Eh, I think he got roughly what he deserved.
I suffocated to death in in a safe? I'm a moron.
Hey hey, Janet? - [beep] - Hi, there.
- Janet, you need to leave me.
- Why? You're the smartest girl in the world - I'm not a girl.
- And your dad is an angel.
You should be with someone better.
I don't deserve you.
Jason, you are all that I care about, possibly because I did not have the capacity to care about anything before you.
I love you.
Also, interesting sidenote, I think I might hate things now, too.
So far, it's genocide and leggings as pants.
This is nuts.
Just weighing in over here.
- Why? - It's the only thing I can think of to do to get rid of this glitch.
Yo, who you calling a glitch? It means "error," Jason, which is what this is.
Oh, really? Is it an error to act unpredictably and behave in ways that run counter to how you were programmed to behave? Yes.
Now, you two sit tight.
I'm gonna go murder Janet, and I'll be right back.
Look on the bright side.
When you're rebooted, I can teach you all the Dorito flavors again.
No.
Where do you suppose she is? I hope she's okay.
You know, the more I work on her case, the more I think she truly belongs here.
I'm I'm sorry that I haven't been able to say what you want me to say, because I-I do want to say it.
What's holding you back? Honestly, my biggest fear is just making sure that my motivation for saying it Chidi? - Wow.
- How did she suddenly? Her motivation changed.
She couldn't earn enough points by apologizing to everyone here because she was only doing it to earn enough points to stay here.
But she did earn enough points, which means that she's decided not to stay here, - which means - That she's leaving.
[tense music] Oh, hey, Janet.
You don't belong here, Jason doesn't belong here, and now that I can think and feel, I don't belong here either.
- Where are you going with this? - There is a woman named Mindy St.
Clair who lives in a neutral zone by herself.
It's neither a Good Place nor a Bad Place.
A Medium Place? Dude, that's where I belong.
I've been saying that since day one.
It's where Jason and I are going.
Would you like to come with us to Mindy's house? Yeah.
Love her, huge fan.
Call the train.
Look, there it is now.
[brakes squealing] I did not call that train.
That train belongs to Shawn, the judge, who's coming here to judge you.
Can you make that train go to Mindy's house? - Yep.
- Then we have to go right now.
I just have to run home real quick and hit save on the Madden game I was playing because Blake Bortles has, like, 300 yards passing in the first half [hissing] [tense music] Shawn.
- Sorry I wasn't here to greet you.
I, uh, had something I needed to tend to, but it can wait, it can wait.
[beeping] Okay, I've hacked into the mainframe.
- [sighs] - Kidding.
[laughs] I can't hack into the mainframe.
Technically, I am the mainframe.
Would you just hurry up? I'm here to rule on the fate of Fake Eleanor Shellstrop.
Yes, yes, um, I think we have a rock solid case for Fake Eleanor.
I'm sorry, Michael.
Sorry, everyone.
[quirky music] Well not great for my case.
And now The end is near And so I face The final curtain - Ow! What the hell? - Walk it off, Lululemon.
I'll say it clear I'll state my case Of which I'm certain I've lived A life that's full I traveled each and "Live every day like it's your last.
" Bite me.
I'ma live forever, bitch.
Ma'am? It's $132.
I'm gonna sit alone in my house watching wedding fails on YouTube, drinking margaritas through a Twizzlers straw until I pass out on top of my vibrator.
Hi there.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment? No.
Buzz off, whale-humper.
You know, I see you here all the time, and you're always mean to me, and it really hurts my feelings.
It does? Because the minute you're out of my line of sight, I literally forget you exist.
Watch.
You exist.
Don't care if you die.
- See? - Why are you like this? Excuse me? Why am I like this? You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.
Look what you made me do, jag-off.
- And did it my - Oh, my God, look out! - Uh-oh.
- Way [inhales sharply] Oh, good, you're awake.
Can I ask you a question about where we're going? Sure.
Where are we going? I forgot.
Hmm, is there a 7-Eleven on the way? 'Cause Janet's powers aren't working, and I want some gum and some football cards and some scratchy tickets.
- Go away from me.
- Okay.
Can this train go any faster, Janet? No pressure, but Jason and I will literally be tortured for all of eternity if we get caught.
Don't worry, there's no way to tell we're going to Mindy St.
Clair's house.
It'll be our sexy little secret.
Jason taught me about sexy things.
Eh, some of those are right.
I'm here to preside over case #00003 regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.
The Bad Place has sent Bad Janet to present their argument.
[tone chimes] What up, ding-dongs? Yeah, so basically, um, the Fake Eleanor's a dirt bag, and these jabronis are gonna try and claim she's less of a dirt bag now, but she just stole your train, and she still sucks bad.
And she belongs with us.
Oh, also, check this out.
[farting] - Nailed it.
- [tone chimes] I've ruled the fart inadmissible as evidence.
She stole your train to voluntarily go down to the Bad Place.
She was sacrificing herself because she is a wonderful, selfless - [crunching] - No, don't oh! - What's happening? - I should have warned you.
Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.
If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.
[suspenseful music] [crunching] - Finally.
- [crunching] - Oh, come - What did he just say? Oh, because you're all so perfect.
[suspenseful music] Wow.
So where does this Mindy St.
I don't have any - of my normal abilities here.
- Perfect.
[sighs] Well, let's try this way.
Ooh, I've never had to walk before.
This is fun.
Now I'm bored.
Walking is dumb.
[light music] [hawk screeches] Well, given that she's the only person in the neighborhood, I'm guessing this is the pl Oh! She's naked! - [screams] - Oh, sorry! - [screams] - [yells] - [screams] - [yells] Who are you? I'm Janet.
I'm from the Good Place, and welcome to your first day - in the afterlife.
- What's up, idiot? Sorry I'm late, babe.
Hey, are you pregnant? - That's not possible.
- Congrats.
Yeah, so, Mindy, look.
You mostly sucked, but then you did this one good thing.
I mean, I still think we should get you They didn't, but neither did we.
A compromise was made: the neighborhood you are in now by yourself.
We got you your favorite beer.
Yeah, but it's always warm.
On your jukebox, you'll find every song ever sung.
Yeah, by The Eagles, and it's only the live versions.
Also, there's some spoken word poetry from William Shatner.
It's deeply terrible.
You get the idea.
Welcome to eternal mediocrity.
One of the perks of living alone is that I get to just walk around naked.
[laughs] My kind of gal.
And I gotta say, you keep it tight.
Oh, that is the nicest and only thing anyone has said to me in 30 years.
So tell us everything.
I mean, what did you do - to end up here? - That's kind of a long story.
- Gonna need a drink or three.
- Definitely my kind of gal.
So I was a hotshot corporate lawyer in the 1980s.
I only cared about making money and doing cocaine.
One night, I had an epiphany, right? I needed to do something good with my life.
So I drew up plans for this foundation that would help kids all over the world, would advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and just improve every nation and every society in every possible way.
- You were pretty coked-up, huh? - Oh, yeah, man, I was flying high.
It was so awesome.
But you're not gonna believe this I followed through.
Yeah, I woke up the next morning, I went straight to the bank, I withdrew my life savings, and I was gonna start - that charity.
[laughs] Do you have any? I'm just I shouldn't Do you? - No.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, I was just I was just kidding.
It was just a joke.
I mean, who would want to do cocaine right now? - Are you okay? - Anyway, so after I died, uh, my sister found my plan, and she used my money to start the Mindy St.
Clair Rescue Alliance, yeah.
It's actually the largest relief aid charity in the world.
Oh, so the question was, did you get credit for all those good person points or not? Exactly.
But anyway, they finally came to this compromise, you know? Well, it beats being tortured.
I was about to turn myself in.
No.
Yeah, there's no time for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.
This is about survival.
You gotta look out for number one.
Right, well, we don't have proof that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.
Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you.
It's just, I know what kind of cake I like.
Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now.
No, thanks.
This way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything.
Later.
What were we talking about? What is her deal? Why is she like this? I don't know, but the meaner she is, the more it turns me on.
Is that weird? - You're my boss.
- Oh, say that to me again, but more disgusted with me, like I'm a worm.
Someone else was sent here by mistake.
His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe he's on the train with Eleanor.
- You knew about Jason? - Yes, I know that he's a fake and that he's married to Janet and that this entire neighborhood is What's the human expression? Ah, yes, a smokin' hot turd.
I will deal with Jason Mendoza later.
For now, I will hear your arguments for why Fake Eleanor Shellstrop should stay in the Good Place.
We can do this, but we must remain emotionless.
I'm talking "Kristen Stewart on a red carpet" level of emotionless here, all right? Begin.
[deadpan] Eleanor dedicated herself to the study of ethics.
[deadpan] Please, I'm begging you, please.
[deadpan] Voluntarily heading to the Bad Place proves that she is a selfless person.
Sorry.
I'm getting choked up.
Yes, voluntarily sacrificing herself and heading to the Bad Place would be a point in her favor.
However, I've just received word that Eleanor is not currently in the Bad Place.
We have no idea where she is.
- Well, what the - What? - Fork! - [crunching] I will now review Eleanor's memories.
You know, we've been at it for a while, and you must be tired.
I've been asleep in goo for the last 29 years, so I'm good.
Call up the screen for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.
Where should we begin, "Waiters Screamed At" or "Cyberbullying of Pregnant Woman from Spin Class"? [melancholy music] [door closes] Hey, you wanna grab a drink or something? Uh, no, I kind of have my own private time routine.
I thought you'd want company after being here alone for so long.
- No.
- Okay, I get it.
Hey, uh, where did you get that? That's not one of my books.
It reminds me of him.
Look, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind.
Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can.
Okay.
Instead of reading, I will watch this VHS copy of "Cannonball Run II.
" Or maybe "The Making of 'Cannonball Run II.
'" Wow.
Very medium.
We tried for two hours, but there was just a lot of, like, bumping into each other.
It was weird.
[speaking Spanish] [air horn blares] This ain't your bar mitzvah anymore, bitch.
It's my 24th birthday! What! Hot tiara, girl.
[air horn blares] That was "The Crashing and Subsequent Destruction of Vanessa Garcia's QuinceaÃ±era.
" Let's move on to another event.
"Heckling of Mall Santas"? "Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop"? "Brief Instagram Flirtation with Kid Rock"? Oh, no.
This is getting away from us.
Fine.
Dramamine.
Helps with the nausea.
Proceed.
Okay, look, I know, obviously, these memories aren't great.
I was particularly disturbed by "Started Fire in Mailbox to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt," but that was the old Eleanor.
She changed.
She worked and she studied and she got better.
Because she's worth it.
I, too, helped Eleanor.
Not as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice.
Eleanor deserves to stay.
Thank you for these testimonials.
A ruling has been reached.
Oh, you want to hear it.
I forgot how needy humans are.
She deserves to be in the Bad Place.
- Oh! - As concerning Jason Mendoza, I have heard no statements nor seen any evidence to suggest oh, he's from Florida? Yeah, he belongs in the Bad Place.
No, but how do you intend to enforce this ruling? You have no idea where they are.
Bad Janet? - [tone chimes] - What's up, fork nuts? Engage walkie-talkie protocol.
[electronic warbling] What if you're here, and I'm like this? Yes, that may work.
[beeping, electronic blaring] Whoa, what is happening? Is she having an orgasm? Did I do it somehow? Attention Eleanor Shellstrop and Jason Mendoza.
This is the Almighty Judge on High of All Beings Living and Dead for All Eternity.
My name's Shawn.
Either return to your original neighborhood, or your accomplices Chidi Anagonye and Tahani Al-Jamil will go to the Bad Place in your stead.
- What? - What? You have four hours.
Good-bye.
Your Honor, please, Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent.
They are not completely innocent.
They told me so themselves.
They aided and abetted two criminals, one of whom was a DJ.
They're gonna send Chidi and Tahani to the Bad Place? We're off the hook, this is amazing! Babe, we are going to be trying to make love all night long.
- We can't let Tahani and Chidi go to the Bad Place.
They're our friends.
- We literally owe it to them.
- If they're really our "friends," then why aren't they here with us right "now"? Because we ran away.
Are you Does your brain work, actually? Do you have a functioning head? I think he has a good point.
I wouldn't go back for those turkeys.
How can you say that? Think practically here.
Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
- But they do.
- That's their problem.
Your problem is whether you get tortured.
Now if you'll excuse me, it's my masturbating time.
When isn't it? We're going back.
- But - Now.
[dramatic music] Can we even make it there in time? I believe so, though it'll be close.
- Where's Jason? - Heads up! Sorry, Eleanor, but I can't let us leave.
Let me try again.
Do do you have another bottle? Hi there, since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat.
- Ah, kind of like a last meal.
- Not like a last meal, just, uh, the final food you might ever eat.
I'm gonna miss these little perks when I'm down in the Bad Place, being forced to wear a a knock-off handbag and drink tap water.
- That's what you think hell is? - Ugh.
Janet, please, we have to go.
I won't start the train until my husband says it's okay.
I don't wanna go to the Bad Place.
It's scary, like the movie "Ratatouille.
" - What? - Yo, I ain't trying to have rats living in my hat and pulling my hair to get me to do stuff.
I'm scared too.
But we can't just abandon our friends and let them take the fall for us.
Sure we can.
It would be so easy to do that.
We'd just go back to Mindy's house, chill out I'd get used to room-temperature beer.
Let's just pretend that we didn't hear the Janet walkie-talkie message.
No, it's time to own up, dude.
I spent my whole life acting like Mindy, me first, no matter what, and it literally took dying and being around a bunch of good people to realize that I was kind of a nightmare.
Why were you like that? Well let me tell you about Doug and Donna Shellstrop.
Hey, Dad, just a warning, Mom's gonna be here in a second.
Ugh, your mother's coming? Oh, boy, hide the silverware.
You mean the silverware you stole from Mom? Yeah, but she keeps trying to steal it back.
I drove here as fast as I could.
Ah-ha! Burn.
Eleanor, just because your father and I are divorced does not mean you can disrespect me like this, okay? We are a family.
Whose birthday is it? - Mine.
- Are you serious? No way.
That was a B.
S.
foul on Chapman.
And since you both forgot, again, which means you definitely didn't get me a present, again, I got myself something.
All my life, I've been taking care of myself and you guys.
I work two after-school jobs because you blew half my college fund bailing your boyfriend out of jail.
So irresponsible.
And you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.
It was so stupid.
He was already guilty, dumbass.
I've been on my own for a while now anyway, and after you sign these papers, it'll be official.
I won't owe you anything; you won't owe me anything.
We should hang out sometime.
[melancholy music] Wow, your parents sucked.
Yeah, they did, and I've been using their crappy parenting as an excuse for my selfish behavior all my life.
No more.
We know what's right here.
We have to go back.
Ride-or-die.
[beeping, train chugging] [beeping] - [alarm chimes] - Time is up.
Well, no use delaying the inevitable.
We surrender.
Together.
Chidi, Tahani, we're back to save your souls.
[panting] Real weird vibe in here.
Was definitely expecting some applause.
You're too late.
You you missed the cut-off.
So now what? [suspenseful music] [groans] What is the most logical decision? I made my initial ruling.
I established a deadline.
The deadline was missed.
The original perpetrators are here.
This is exhausting.
I just want to go back to my container of goo and go to sleep.
The Bad Place is owed two people.
In my opinion, which is an objective fact in this case and all cases always and forever, you have all done bad things since you arrived here, therefore I don't care which two of you go.
Uh, don't I get to weigh in? No.
I am in charge of all matters here for the next 30 minutes.
Bring me a list of the frozen yogurt flavors.
We have some work to do there as well.
[indistinct chattering] [phones ringing] [indistinct chattering] Morning, Mike.
How's it hanging? Oh.
Fine, Dave, just fine.
I put your mail on your desk and you have an appointment later with the Director of Point Calculations.
I get to design it myself? You've been an apprentice long enough.
You're ready.
Oh, Dave, I'm gonna work so hard.
My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.
[chuckles] Okay.
Easy there, rookie.
Starting immediately, you'll be out of my department.
You'll be reporting directly to the front office.
[ethereal music] All I ever wanted was for this neighborhood my first neighborhood to be perfect.
Somehow I blew it and well, you're all suffering, and for that, I'm deeply sorry.
This is truly the saddest day of my life.
[upbeat circus music playing] [people cheering] [ending fanfare] [sighs] Okay, I guess I'll speak first.
Jason and I are the mistakes.
We're the ones who misled everybody and dragged you all into this mess, so we should go to the Bad Place.
- Agreed.
- Yes.
That judge guy just said everyone here has done bad things.
Let's look at this ethnically.
For what I hope is the last time, it is "ethically.
" You guys helped me and Eleanor, right, but we're bad, so you helping us was bad.
It's basic consequentialism: the morality of an action is solely judged on its consequences.
[claps hands] Great.
[laughs] The one time you actually remember something from class.
Maybe I was brought here by mistake, but since we've been here, I just tried to stay out of everyone's way.
He killed my wife! I was trying to stop you from doing it! Yeah, but you did it.
He who smelt it murdered Janet.
Okay, well, it's settled then.
Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.
For the last time, my name is Jason, not Jianyu, the amazing and incredible monk.
Which is why you belong in the Bad Place.
And by the way, Janet is not your wife, or your soul mate.
There's a Janet in every neighborhood.
It was not legal.
Okay, J-bones, you and me, outside.
What? But I'm not going.
I don't wanna.
I know you don't "wanna," goofball.
I don't wanna either, but let's face it.
Chidi and Tahani are better people than we are.
We tried to improve ourselves and you know what? We did a good job.
- [making fart noises] - I could never do that on Earth.
This place truly is paradise.
- Look at them.
- [sighs] Whispering away like two Beefeaters on a tea break.
I bet they're plotting against us.
No way.
Eleanor wouldn't do that.
[clicks tongue] You do have feelings for her, don't you? I don't know.
Please don't make me think about this again.
My brain will break.
I'm sorry, it's just that I have certain feelings for you.
You must see this.
The universe keeps intertwining our fates.
It's meaningful, don't you think? This whole romantic situation is such a mess.
I am vexed, Tahani.
Vexed.
What's gonna happen to me when Jason and Fake Eleanor go and you're off with Real Eleanor? Whither Tahani? [claps hands] Okay, team meeting.
Jason has agreed that the two of us should go.
- Bye, Tahani.
- [sad music] Sorry for everything.
After I'm gone you can go ahead and clean out my bud hole.
Thank you.
I love you so much, baby.
Promise me you'll visit.
Well, it's been real, dog.
Sorry, that's how I ended most of my serious relationships.
Yeah, that checks out.
I feel like I failed you.
No.
Don't ever think that.
I was dropped into a cave, and you were my flashlight.
Oh.
I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper.
[both sniffling] All right, ready to go? Let's grab Michael.
[knocking at the door] Come in.
Hi, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.
Um, I'm going to the Bad Place.
I've taken one of the slots.
- What? - Awesome.
Eleanor, that's crazy.
You belong here.
There's another reason.
Everyone here is supposed to have a soul mate, and my soul mate doesn't love me.
[sad music] I don't know if you love the other Eleanor or Tahani or someone else, but you don't love me, which means that this will never really be my Good Place.
I'm going, so you only have to choose one more person.
[door closes] Okay, that means that means that what does that mean? It means I get to stay here with my wife forever! We did it, Eleanor! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Whoo-hoo! This is so dope! I get to stay You realize if you stay, I still have to go, right? Yes, but I get to stay.
Good point, bud.
This is a real mess, huh? No matter what they decide, I'd bet you're gonna be in pretty hot water with your boss.
Wouldn't be surprised if retirement were on the table.
Retirement? Course, what do I know? I'm just The All-Knowing Judge of All Matters in the Afterlife.
But face it, this is your mistake.
- Morning, Mike.
- Morning, Val.
[groans] Which one's which? I always forget.
Black is regular, orange is anti-matter.
We never even get to be there to see how fun it is.
Yeah, I guess, but don't rock the boat here, pal, just try to do a good job.
[playful music] Mm.
French vanilla? Regular anti-matter's fine, why flavor it? A good job.
All right, nerds, let's just get this over with.
I'll go to the Bad Place with Real Eleanor, - and you three can stay.
- Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it! Wait, no.
You're not going.
- Do you? - I don't know.
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.
The point is, if she's going down there because of me, I'll never be at peace.
Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it! No, dude, this is bonkers.
I am going.
End of story.
No, I'm going.
I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.
Chidi and I are going to go together, which means that you and Real Eleanor and Jason can stay.
Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it! Look, I love you and I think you love me.
We can be together, away from everyone else.
Obviously, we'll be miserable, but I truly believe our love will make us happy.
Okay, you realize the Bad Place is not some sort of couples retreat, right? If it is, Janet and I would like to go.
I am going! And Real Eleanor is going! No, I'm going with Real Eleanor! No, I'm going with Chidi! Me and Janet are staying, just FYI.
Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover.
- [all talking at once] - Guys? [all talking at once] Guys! [groans] [all talking at once] [dramatic music] Holy motherforking shirtballs.
What? Oh, man.
Wow! [laughing] Okay, okay.
Uh, whoo! Yo, Mikey! Shawn! Come on out! Is everything okay? Right as rain, Mikey my boy.
So, Chidi and I are gonna go to the Bad Place.
- What? - Trust me, I've got this.
That's our decision.
Let's hit it.
Point of order.
I don't accept this offer.
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.
Gah, gah, gah, gah! You said any two of us.
It's me and Chidi.
Let's do it to it.
Michael! I just found an obscure precedent in the rules that might just save everyone.
Buzz off, Bambadjan! Don't need it.
Eleanor, what's going on? It took me a while to figure it out, but just now as we were all fighting and yelling at each other and each one of us demanding we should go to the Bad Place, I thought to myself, "Man, this is torture.
" And then it hit me.
They're never gonna call a train to take us to the Bad Place.
The can't, because we're already here.
This is the Bad Place.
[dramatic music] [evil laugh] Oh, man! I can't believe you figured it out.
[laughs] Oh, God! Y-you ruined everything, you know that? Oh, man.
Eleanor, you really suck! - [gasps] - I was so close to pulling it off! [groans, stammering] [sobs] [ceramic crunches] Sorry.
This is paradise.
Oh, it looks like paradise, but it's actually a filthy dumpster full of our worst anxieties.
I'm surrounded by people who are literally better than me.
Just me being here forced Chidi into an ethical "clusterfork.
" Tahani tortured Jason by constantly trying to get him to talk, Jason tortured my because I was sure he would blow our cover, which was torture for Chidi, because he was responsible for me, which made Chidi seem like the perfect soul mate, and that tortured Tahani because he didn't love her.
You don't love me? Please, don't ask me that right now.
See? We've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable.
I had to be his assistant and try and find myself.
And I had the perfect bud hole and no dudes to share it with.
He played us like a fiddle.
You gotta give it up.
Oh, dip! Eleanor, I told you that first night that we were in a prank show.
Oh, yeah.
You did! Great job, man.
[laughs] Chidi, don't go! I don't care if you don't love me, I love you.
It's the only thing that makes any sense to me in this crazy world, - and I think we should stay - No, stop, Vicky.
Eleanor figured it out.
[groans] Man! This was supposed to be my big moment.
I just rehearsed that speech for, like, three hours.
Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst, and you can all suck it.
Do you remember what I told you when you predicted you could do this for 1,000 years? The time has come to innovate.
The human afterlife can be more fun.
For us, obviously, not for the people we're torturing.
Who cares about those dummies? [laughter] I present to you the perfect recipe for my proposed experiment.
We've tried this.
Humans are very reticent to torture each other.
Even getting them to do simple things like pulling out each other's teeth is like I can't think of the right analogy.
What makes you think that you can get them to do this? Because they won't even know that they are doing it.
I'm going to make them think that they are in the Good Place, and to make sure that they drive each other insane, I will be there, posing as a Good Place architect.
What? I even stole a Good Place Janet we can use.
Ugh! It can work.
- [scoffs] - Look, we can just send them all to the hot spike pits with the lava and the bees and the lightning that tears off their flesh.
Too many moving parts.
That's what will make it fun.
I cannot predict everything that's gonna happen, but we'll improvise.
We'll we'll be on our toes.
It'll be exciting.
I think that we can get them to torture each other for 1,000 years.
I think you'll be lucky to get six months out of this insane gambit.
But take me through it.
Um oh, sorry.
I thought we reserved the conference room.
No, Todd, we have it until 3:00.
Sorry.
Sorry, everyone.
So, Bambadjan and Gunnar and Shawn everyone else in this neighborhood Except for you four, everyone in this neighborhood is one of us.
After I came up with everyone's characters, we'd just create fun scenarios designed to torture you.
How can I be over it? We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
Okay.
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.
Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye.
- Ooh.
- Tracy, you're his soul mate, Nina a marriage counselor.
[both laughing] Maybe we can get them to swing with us.
[laughter] That's perfect, perfect! Shh, shh, shh.
When I confessed.
You had no idea I was gonna do that, because honestly, I had no idea I was gonna do that, Yeah, that came out of nowhere.
I mean, after that it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.
You know, I definitely underestimated how effective Chidi was gonna be, teaching you to be good, and obviously, we didn't anticipate that Janet would fall in love with Jason.
Hang on.
That part is real.
Oh, yeah.
Janet isn't one of us.
I mean [laughs] What a world, huh? Wait, I don't get something.
I know why Jason and I were sent here, but why Tahani? Oh, yeah.
Didn't you raise, like, $1,000 for charity, or whatever? Uh, $60 billion, actually, so.
[playful music] Oh.
But it didn't matter because my motivations were corrupt.
I didn't care about helping the people I raised the money for.
I just wanted to prove my parents wrong, stick it to my sister, get fame and attention.
My only real goal was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.
But wait, why is Chidi here? Well, uh there's something you don't know about me.
I read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use - almond milk in my coffee - No, dingus! You hurt everyone in your life with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.
[playful music] Oh, fork! You're right.
Every friend, every girlfriend was driven nuts because I couldn't do anything.
I missed my mom's back surgery because I had already promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone.
I made everyone miserable.
Well, if it'll make you feel any better, you were the closest to actually getting in, up there.
You weren't that close.
Good.
Thank you, Chidi.
I really needed to hear that right now.
I mean, all this hard work, all the planning, all for nothing.
This really sucks.
No, it doesn't.
This is wonderful.
You saw us all on Earth a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud with legs for days Side note, I might legit be into Tahani.
We improved each other, and the four of us became a team.
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.
Oh, Eleanor.
That's it! My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
- Uh, next time? - Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna erase your memories, you know, make a few changes and start over again.
Hopefully.
[dramatic music] Guys, we need a plan.
Quick.
Tahani, anything? Chidi, I need ya.
You're the smart one.
I-I can't.
I-I can't.
- Jason? - What? What's up? Ugh! What do you say? Take two, huh? I don't know.
I mean, what is this? All this work for four people, and me, I'm wearing a judge's robe? I feel like a real weenie.
Okay.
But you're way out on a limb here, Mike.
If this thing goes sideways again, you are done.
Guys, he is going to erase our memories at any second and all of this will have been for nothing.
Ugh! You're useless! [dramatic music] What do I write? What do I write? Ooh! Come on, brain.
Janet? You can't eat anything, right? - Correct.
- Open up.
All right, let's try again, shall we? You know what, bro? Do your worst.
Cool.
[upbeat music] You know the way you feel when you see a chimpanzee and a baby tiger who've become friends? [laughter] That's how you're going to feel every day.
Your medical relief mission to Kazakhstan, that really put you over the top, you got a ton of points for that.
Eleanor? I'm Chris Baker.
I'm your soul mate.
Cool.
Bring it in, man.
So where are you from, Chris? I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey, and I was a mailman.
I gotta stay jacked, it's who I am.
Yeah, you gotta.
Once I'm back, we'll get to know each other.
Great.
See ya soon.
- [door closes] - [beep] - Hi there.
- [gasps] - Who are you? - I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.
And now The end is near And so I face The final curtain - Ow! What the hell? - Walk it off, Lululemon.
I'll say it clear I'll state my case Of which I'm certain I've lived A life that's full I traveled each and "Live every day like it's your last.
" Bite me.
I'ma live forever, bitch.
Ma'am? It's $132.
21.
So, big plans this weekend? Yep.
I'm gonna sit alone in my house watching wedding fails on YouTube, drinking margaritas through a Twizzlers straw until I pass out on top of my vibrator.
Buzz off, whale-humper.
You know, I see you here all the time, and you're always mean to me, and it really hurts my feelings.
It does? Because the minute you're out of my line of sight, I literally forget you exist.
Watch.
You exist.
You don't exist.
You're bothering me.
Don't care if you die.
Look what you made me do, jag-off.
- And did it my - Oh, my God, look out! - Uh-oh.
- Way [inhales sharply] Oh, good, you're awake.
Can I ask you a question about where we're going? Sure.
Where are we going? I forgot.
We're going somewhere that's not the Good Place, and it's not the Bad Place.
We're going to a Medium Place.
Hmm, is there a 7-Eleven on the way? 'Cause Janet's powers aren't working, and I want some gum and some football cards and some scratchy tickets.
Can this train go any faster, Janet? No pressure, but Jason and I will literally be tortured for all of eternity if we get caught.
Don't worry, there's no way to tell we're going to Mindy St.
Clair's house.
It'll be our sexy little secret.
Jason taught me about sexy things.
Oh, yeah? What things did he say were sexy? Lamborghinis, cool snakes, spinning rims, 20,000 followers on Instagram, girls with pigtails eating lollipops, latex pants, Carl's Jr.
ads, and sex.
Eh, some of those are right.
[tone chimes] What up, ding-dongs? Yeah, so basically, um, the Fake Eleanor's a dirt bag, and these jabronis are gonna try and claim she's less of a dirt bag now, but she just stole your train, and she still sucks bad.
And she belongs with us.
Oh, also, check this out.
[farting] - Nailed it.
- [tone chimes] I've ruled the fart inadmissible as evidence.
What I will consider is the recent development - of Eleanor stealing my train.
- Now, hold on a second.
She stole your train to voluntarily go down to the Bad Place.
If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.
[suspenseful music] [crunching] - Finally.
- [crunching] - Oh, come - What did he just say? Oh, because you're all so perfect.
[suspenseful music] Wow.
So where does this Mindy St.
Clair live? I don't know.
I'm out of range of our neighborhood.
I don't have any - of my normal abilities here.
Ooh, I've never had to walk before.
This is fun.
Now I'm bored.
Walking is dumb.
[light music] [hawk screeches] Well, given that she's the only person in the neighborhood, I'm guessing this is the pl Oh! She's naked! - [screams] - Oh, sorry! - [screams] - [yells] - [screams] - [yells] Who are you? I'm Janet.
Hello, Mindy.
My name is Beadie.
I'm from the Good Place, and welcome to your first day - in the afterlife.
- Congrats.
Yeah, so, Mindy, look.
You mostly sucked, but then you did this one good thing.
I mean, I still think we should get you They didn't, but neither did we.
A compromise was made: the neighborhood you are in now by yourself.
You submitted a list of things you wanted; the Good Place provided those things.
Yeah, and the Bad Place made some modifications.
We got you your favorite beer.
Yeah, by The Eagles, and it's only the live versions.
Also, there's some spoken word poetry from William Shatner.
It's deeply terrible.
You get the idea.
Welcome to eternal mediocrity.
- Welcome to the Medium Place.
- So what's up? What's your deal? Are you single? - What's going on? - [static crackles] Sorry about before.
One of the perks of living alone is that I get to just walk around naked.
Oh, that is the nicest and only thing anyone has said to me in 30 years.
So tell us everything.
I mean, what did you do - to end up here? - That's kind of a long story.
- Gonna need a drink or three.
- Definitely my kind of gal.
You guys have fun.
This is me and Janet's honeymoon, so we're gonna go try and figure out how to have sex.
So I was a hotshot corporate lawyer in the 1980s.
So I drew up plans for this foundation that would help kids all over the world, would advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and just improve every nation and every society in every possible way.
- You were pretty coked-up, huh? - Oh, yeah, man, I was flying high.
It was so awesome.
But you're not gonna believe this I followed through.
Yeah, I woke up the next morning, I went straight to the bank, I withdrew my life savings, and I was gonna start - that charity.
- Good for you! And then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.
- Ooh - Honestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna kill me [chuckles] 'Cause I love cocaine.
[laughs] Do you have any? I'm just I shouldn't Do you? - No.
It was just a joke.
I mean, who would want to do cocaine right now? - Are you okay? - Anyway, so after I died, uh, my sister found my plan, and she used my money to start the Mindy St.
Clair Rescue Alliance, yeah.
It's actually the largest relief aid charity in the world.
Oh, so the question was, did you get credit for all those good person points or not? Exactly.
I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time.
[chuckles] Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean.
But anyway, they finally came to this compromise, you know? Well, it beats being tortured.
Yeah, there's no time for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.
This is about survival.
You gotta look out for number one.
Right, well, we don't have proof that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.
Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you.
Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.
Oh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we Yeah, no, I get it.
It's just, I know what kind of cake I like.
This way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything.
Later.
What were we talking about? What is her deal? Why is she like this? I don't know, but the meaner she is, the more it turns me on.
Is that weird? - You're my boss.
- Oh, say that to me again, but more disgusted with me, like I'm a worm.
Eleanor was supposed to be in the Bad Place, arrived here by accident, assumed another person's identity, and has now escaped.
Is that the whole story? Well, no.
Someone else was sent here by mistake.
I will deal with Jason Mendoza later.
For now, I will hear your arguments for why Fake Eleanor Shellstrop should stay in the Good Place.
We can do this, but we must remain emotionless.
I'm talking "Kristen Stewart on a red carpet" level of emotionless here, all right? Begin.
[deadpan] Eleanor dedicated herself to the study of ethics.
I was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.
[deadpan] Eleanor is a magnificent person who has grown tremendously in her time here.
[deadpan] Please, I'm begging you, please.
I'm getting choked up.
Yes, voluntarily sacrificing herself and heading to the Bad Place would be a point in her favor.
However, I've just received word that Eleanor is not currently in the Bad Place.
We have no idea where she is.
- Well, what the - What? - Fork! - [crunching] I will now review Eleanor's memories.
Her memories? As in, all the things - she's done on Earth? - Mm-hmm.
But perhaps we could take a little break first.
You know, we've been at it for a while, and you must be tired.
Where should we begin, "Waiters Screamed At" or "Cyberbullying of Pregnant Woman from Spin Class"? [melancholy music] [door closes] Hey, you wanna grab a drink or something? Uh, no, I kind of have my own private time routine.
I thought you'd want company after being here alone for so long.
- No.
- Okay, I get it.
Hey, uh, where did you get that? That's not one of my books.
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography.
My friend in the Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics.
It reminds me of him.
Okay.
Instead of reading, I will watch this VHS copy of "Cannonball Run II.
" Or maybe "The Making of 'Cannonball Run II.
'" Wow.
Very medium.
Yeah.
Hey, you two lovebirds figure out how to have sex yet? No.
We tried for two hours, but there was just a lot of, like, bumping into each other.
It's my 24th birthday! What! Hot tiara, girl.
[air horn blares] That was "The Crashing and Subsequent Destruction of Vanessa Garcia's QuinceaÃ±era.
" Let's move on to another event.
"Heckling of Mall Santas"? "Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop"? "Brief Instagram Flirtation with Kid Rock"? Oh, no.
This is getting away from us.
We need to do something quickly.
Yeah, uh, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally? Ugh.
Fine.
Proceed.
Okay, look, I know, obviously, these memories aren't great.
I was particularly disturbed by "Started Fire in Mailbox to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt," but that was the old Eleanor.
She changed.
She worked and she studied and she got better.
And it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement.
I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did.
Because she's worth it.
Eleanor deserves to stay.
Thank you for these testimonials.
A ruling has been reached.
Oh, you want to hear it.
I forgot how needy humans are.
[clears throat] Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.
The progress she has made does not offset her actions on Earth.
She deserves to be in the Bad Place.
Bad Janet? - [tone chimes] - What's up, fork nuts? Engage walkie-talkie protocol.
[electronic warbling] What if you're here, and I'm like this? Yes, that may work.
[beeping, electronic blaring] Whoa, what is happening? Is she having an orgasm? Did I do it somehow? Attention Eleanor Shellstrop and Jason Mendoza.
This is the Almighty Judge on High of All Beings Living and Dead for All Eternity.
My name's Shawn.
We do not know where you are but hope you are receiving this message.
You have been found to be the rightful property of the Bad Place.
Either return to your original neighborhood, or your accomplices Chidi Anagonye and Tahani Al-Jamil will go to the Bad Place in your stead.
Your Honor, please, Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent.
They are not completely innocent.
They told me so themselves.
They aided and abetted two criminals, one of whom was a DJ.
They're gonna send Chidi and Tahani to the Bad Place? We're off the hook, this is amazing! Babe, we are going to be trying to make love all night long.
We don't have to go back, though.
- they just said.
- We can't let Tahani and Chidi go to the Bad Place.
- If they're really our "friends," then why aren't they here with us right "now"? Because we ran away.
Are you Does your brain work, actually? Do you have a functioning head? I think he has a good point.
I wouldn't go back for those turkeys.
How can you say that? Think practically here.
Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
Or you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.
- But they do.
Now if you'll excuse me, it's my masturbating time.
When isn't it? We're going back.
- But - Now.
[dramatic music] Can we even make it there in time? I believe so, though it'll be close.
- Where's Jason? - Heads up! Sorry, Eleanor, but I can't let us leave.
[slow motion] Bortles! [dramatic music] No! [clink] What are you doing, you goon? Trying to blow up the train.
Blowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.
Let me try again.
- Not like a last meal, just, uh, the final food you might ever eat.
I'm gonna miss these little perks when I'm down in the Bad Place, being forced to wear a a knock-off handbag and drink tap water.
- That's what you think hell is? - Ugh.
Janet, please, we have to go.
I won't start the train until my husband says it's okay.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged a ride-or-die protocol so I'm loyal to Jason forever.
Buddy Come on, we gotta go.
I don't wanna go to the Bad Place.
I'm scared too.
But we can't just abandon our friends and let them take the fall for us.
Sure we can.
It would be so easy to do that.
We'd just go back to Mindy's house, chill out I'd get used to room-temperature beer.
Me and Janet keep trying to solve the problem of how to have sex, which could take years.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's just pretend that we didn't hear the Janet walkie-talkie message.
Why were you like that? Well let me tell you about Doug and Donna Shellstrop.
Hey, Dad, just a warning, Mom's gonna be here in a second.
Ugh, your mother's coming? Oh, boy, hide the silverware.
You mean the silverware you stole from Mom? Yeah, but she keeps trying to steal it back.
I drove here as fast as I could.
You scored free WrestleMania tickets? There are no tickets, Mom.
I knew that was the only way I could get you here.
Ah-ha! Burn.
- Are you serious? No way.
That was a B.
S.
foul on Chapman.
And since you both forgot, again, which means you definitely didn't get me a present, again, I got myself something.
I just need you to sign it.
Emancipation papers? Honey! What does "emancipation" mean? It means I'll be on my own.
All my life, I've been taking care of myself and you guys.
And you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.
It was so stupid.
He was already guilty, dumbass.
I've been on my own for a while now anyway, and after you sign these papers, it'll be official.
I won't owe you anything; you won't owe me anything.
Well, if you want me to sign oh, that's a joint.
Uh, do you have a pen or a lighter? You're a really interesting person, Eleanor.
We should hang out sometime.
No more.
We know what's right here.
We have to go back.
Ride-or-die.
[beeping, train chugging] [beeping] - [alarm chimes] - Time is up.
In preparation for your trip to the Bad Place, please put on these fedoras.
Oh, no.
Well, no use delaying the inevitable.
Chidi, Tahani, we're back to save your souls.
[panting] Real weird vibe in here.
Was definitely expecting some applause.
You're too late.
You you missed the cut-off.
But we're here.
We came here as fast as we could, and we're here.
So now what? [suspenseful music] [groans] What is the most logical decision? I made my initial ruling.
The original perpetrators are here.
This is exhausting.
I just want to go back to my container of goo and go to sleep.
The Bad Place is owed two people.
In my opinion, which is an objective fact in this case and all cases always and forever, you have all done bad things since you arrived here, therefore I don't care which two of you go.
You can decide.
You have 30 minutes.
Uh, don't I get to weigh in? No.
We have some work to do there as well.
[indistinct chattering] [phones ringing] [indistinct chattering] Morning, Mike.
How's it hanging? Oh.
Fine, Dave, just fine.
I put your mail on your desk and you have an appointment later with the Director of Point Calculations.
Ugh.
Listen, we got the files for the new crop of incoming, and the Big Guy thinks it's time for you to fly solo.
I get to design it myself? You've been an apprentice long enough.
My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.
[chuckles] Okay.
Easy there, rookie.
Starting immediately, you'll be out of my department.
You'll be reporting directly to the front office.
This is your shot.
Good luck.
[ethereal music] All I ever wanted was for this neighborhood my first neighborhood to be perfect.
[upbeat circus music playing] [people cheering] [ending fanfare] [sighs] Okay, I guess I'll speak first.
Jason and I are the mistakes.
We're the ones who misled everybody and dragged you all into this mess, so we should go to the Bad Place.
- Agreed.
- Yes.
Okay, I thought you were gonna at least pretend to fight me on that, but whatever.
Hang on.
That judge guy just said everyone here has done bad things.
" You guys helped me and Eleanor, right, but we're bad, so you helping us was bad.
It's basic consequentialism: the morality of an action is solely judged on its consequences.
[claps hands] Great.
[laughs] The one time you actually remember something from class.
Maybe I was brought here by mistake, but since we've been here, I just tried to stay out of everyone's way.
Chidi's done worse stuff than me.
He murdered Janet.
He killed my wife! I was trying to stop you from doing it! Yeah, but you did it.
Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.
For the last time, my name is Jason, not Jianyu, the amazing and incredible monk.
Which is why you belong in the Bad Place.
And by the way, Janet is not your wife, or your soul mate.
There's a Janet in every neighborhood.
Well, I'm in love with this Janet.
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff which almost turned out to be sex, and we were married in a legal ceremony.
It was not legal.
I don't wanna.
I know you don't "wanna," goofball.
I don't wanna either, but let's face it.
Chidi and Tahani are better people than we are.
We tried to improve ourselves and you know what? We did a good job.
Well, I did a good job.
You mostly fell asleep in class or made fart noises with your hands.
- [making fart noises] - I could never do that on Earth.
- [sighs] Whispering away like two Beefeaters on a tea break.
I bet they're plotting against us.
No way.
Eleanor wouldn't do that.
[clicks tongue] You do have feelings for her, don't you? I don't know.
Yes.
But no.
Please don't make me think about this again.
You must see this.
The universe keeps intertwining our fates.
It's meaningful, don't you think? This whole romantic situation is such a mess.
I am vexed, Tahani.
Vexed.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to contribute to your misery, it's just that I'm frightened.
I don't have an actual soul mate.
What's gonna happen to me when Jason and Fake Eleanor go and you're off with Real Eleanor? Whither Tahani? [claps hands] Okay, team meeting.
- [sad music] Sorry for everything.
After I'm gone you can go ahead and clean out my bud hole.
Thank you.
I love you so much, baby.
Promise me you'll visit.
I will not.
It is literally impossible for me to do that.
Well, it's been real, dog.
I feel like I failed you.
No.
Don't ever think that.
I was dropped into a cave, and you were my flashlight.
Oh.
Good-bye forever.
I will miss you so much.
I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper.
Hi, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.
Um, I'm going to the Bad Place.
I've taken one of the slots.
- What? - Awesome.
I've been there, I know I can hack it.
Actually, I have kind of a rapport with some of the fire monsters.
Eleanor, that's crazy.
Everyone here is supposed to have a soul mate, and my soul mate doesn't love me.
[sad music] I don't know if you love the other Eleanor or Tahani or someone else, but you don't love me, which means that this will never really be my Good Place.
I'm going, so you only have to choose one more person.
[door closes] Okay, that means that means that what does that mean? It means I get to stay here with my wife forever! We did it, Eleanor! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Whoo-hoo! This is so dope! I get to stay You realize if you stay, I still have to go, right? Yes, but I get to stay.
Good point, bud.
Well reasoned.
Wow, Chidi is a terrible writer.
This is a real mess, huh? No matter what they decide, I'd bet you're gonna be in pretty hot water with your boss.
But face it, this is your mistake.
- Morning, Mike.
- Morning, Val.
[groans] Which one's which? I always forget.
Black is regular, orange is anti-matter.
Working on your first solo design, right? How's it coming? Do you ever get the feeling we could be doing it all differently? I mean, it's always the same.
We get the names, come up with the design, they arrive, we move on to the next one.
We never even get to be there to see how fun it is.
French vanilla? Regular anti-matter's fine, why flavor it? A good job.
All right, nerds, let's just get this over with.
I'll go to the Bad Place with Real Eleanor, - and you three can stay.
- Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it! Wait, no.
You're not going.
I am.
- What? - Why? Real Eleanor is my soul mate or was my soul mate and she's only going down there because she thinks that I don't love her.
- Do you? - I don't know.
The point is, if she's going down there because of me, I'll never be at peace.
Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it! No, dude, this is bonkers.
I am going.
End of story.
No, I'm going.
End of everything.
What? Now you're trying to replace Chidi? No.
I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.
We can be together, away from everyone else.
Obviously, we'll be miserable, but I truly believe our love will make us happy.
Okay, you realize the Bad Place is not some sort of couples retreat, right? If it is, Janet and I would like to go.
I am going! And Real Eleanor is going! No, I'm going with Real Eleanor! No, I'm going with Chidi! Me and Janet are staying, just FYI.
Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover.
- Hey, that's racist! - Not a robot.
Oh, you have some nerve.
- [all talking at once] - Guys? [all talking at once] Guys! [groans] [all talking at once] [dramatic music] Holy motherforking shirtballs.
Uh, whoo! Yo, Mikey! Shawn! Come on out! Is everything okay? Right as rain, Mikey my boy.
So, Chidi and I are gonna go to the Bad Place.
- What? - Trust me, I've got this.
That's our decision.
Let's hit it.
Well, what about Real Eleanor? No, it's me and Chidi.
Call the train.
Point of order.
Gah, gah, gah, gah! You said any two of us.
It's me and Chidi.
Let's do it to it.
Michael! I just found an obscure precedent in the rules that might just save everyone.
Buzz off, Bambadjan! Don't need it.
Oh, okay.
[chuckles] [door closes] Ready when you are, boss.
Eleanor, what's going on? It took me a while to figure it out, but just now as we were all fighting and yelling at each other and each one of us demanding we should go to the Bad Place, I thought to myself, "Man, this is torture.
The can't, because we're already here.
This is the Bad Place.
[dramatic music] [evil laugh] Oh, man! I can't believe you figured it out.
[laughs] Oh, God! Y-you ruined everything, you know that? Oh, man.
Eleanor, you really suck! - [gasps] - I was so close to pulling it off! [groans, stammering] [sobs] [ceramic crunches] Sorry.
So she's right? Yeah, she figured it out.
No, this doesn't make any sense.
This is paradise.
Just me being here forced Chidi into an ethical "clusterfork.
" Tahani tortured Jason by constantly trying to get him to talk, Jason tortured my because I was sure he would blow our cover, which was torture for Chidi, because he was responsible for me, which made Chidi seem like the perfect soul mate, and that tortured Tahani because he didn't love her.
You don't love me? Please, don't ask me that right now.
See? We've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable.
I had to be his assistant and try and find myself.
He convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.
He made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.
And I had the perfect bud hole and no dudes to share it with.
Oh, dip! Eleanor, I told you that first night that we were in a prank show.
Oh, yeah.
You did! Great job, man.
[laughs] Chidi, don't go! I don't care if you don't love me, I love you.
It's the only thing that makes any sense to me in this crazy world, - and I think we should stay - No, stop, Vicky.
They figured it out.
- They - They know this is the Bad Place.
Eleanor figured it out.
Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst, and you can all suck it.
Do you remember what I told you when you predicted you could do this for 1,000 years? The time has come to innovate.
The human afterlife can be more fun.
For us, obviously, not for the people we're torturing.
Who cares about those dummies? [laughter] I present to you the perfect recipe for my proposed experiment.
Four people, perfectly suited to make each other miserable.
I'm going to design an afterlife where they torture each other.
We've tried this.
What makes you think that you can get them to do this? Because they won't even know that they are doing it.
I'm going to make them think that they are in the Good Place, and to make sure that they drive each other insane, I will be there, posing as a Good Place architect.
What? I even stole a Good Place Janet we can use.
Ugh! It can work.
- [scoffs] - Look, we can just send them all to the hot spike pits with the lava and the bees and the lightning that tears off their flesh.
Let's try something new.
Too many variables.
Too many moving parts.
We'll we'll be on our toes.
It'll be exciting.
I think that we can get them to torture each other for 1,000 years.
I think you'll be lucky to get six months out of this insane gambit.
But take me through it.
How would this work, exactly? Oh.
Yes, all right, so [clears throat] This is a 14 million-point plan.
Um oh, sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry, everyone.
So, Bambadjan and Gunnar and Shawn everyone else in this neighborhood Except for you four, everyone in this neighborhood is one of us.
After I came up with everyone's characters, we'd just create fun scenarios designed to torture you.
How can I be over it? We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice vacation from your full-time job.
Get your story straight.
Okay.
Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye.
- Ooh.
- Tracy, you're his soul mate, Nina a marriage counselor.
[both laughing] Maybe we can get them to swing with us.
[laughter] That's perfect, perfect! Shh, shh, shh.
Hey, guys? It's Michael! [groans] That was really a fun time.
Then it all started to go off the rails.
When I confessed.
You know, I definitely underestimated how effective Chidi was gonna be, teaching you to be good, and obviously, we didn't anticipate that Janet would fall in love with Jason.
Hang on.
That part is real.
Oh, yeah.
Janet isn't one of us.
No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe for all of the neighborhoods, good and bad.
And apparently, this Janet is in love with Jason.
I mean [laughs] What a world, huh? Wait, I don't get something.
[playful music] Oh.
But it didn't matter because my motivations were corrupt.
I didn't care about helping the people I raised the money for.
I just wanted to prove my parents wrong, stick it to my sister, get fame and attention.
My only real goal was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.
Which I did.
Couple of times, actually.
But wait, why is Chidi here? Well, uh there's something you don't know about me.
Every friend, every girlfriend was driven nuts because I couldn't do anything.
I missed my mom's back surgery because I had already promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone.
I made everyone miserable.
Well, if it'll make you feel any better, you were the closest to actually getting in, up there.
You weren't that close.
You were just the closest.
That makes me feel worse, somehow.
Good.
I mean, all this hard work, all the planning, all for nothing.
This really sucks.
No, it doesn't.
This is wonderful.
You saw us all on Earth a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud with legs for days Side note, I might legit be into Tahani.
But that's for another time.
You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.
We improved each other, and the four of us became a team.
That's it! My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
- Uh, next time? - Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna erase your memories, you know, make a few changes and start over again.
Hopefully.
Just gotta get the boss man to sign off.
Wish me luck.
[dramatic music] Guys, we need a plan.
You're the smart one.
I-I can't.
I-I can't.
- Jason? - What? What's up? Ugh! What do you say? Take two, huh? I don't know.
I mean, what is this? All this work for four people, and me, I'm wearing a judge's robe? I feel like a real weenie.
Look, for a first attempt it was actually very promising.
Let me let me just tinker a little, try again.
Okay.
Guys, he is going to erase our memories at any second and all of this will have been for nothing.
Ugh! You're useless! [dramatic music] What do I write? What do I write? Ooh! Come on, brain.
Janet? You can't eat anything, right? - Correct.
- Open up.
All right, let's try again, shall we? You know what, bro? Do your worst.
We figured it out once, we can do it again, because you know what, Michael? Ya bas [chimes tinkle] [door opening] Eleanor, come on in.
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Cool.
Eleanor? I'm Chris Baker.
I'm your soul mate.
Cool.
Bring it in, man.
So where are you from, Chris? I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey, and I was a mailman.
Really? [laughs] Chris, you'll stand by me no matter what, right? Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out? I love working out.
I gotta stay jacked, it's who I am.
Great.
See ya soon.
- [door closes] - [beep] - Hi there.
- [gasps] - Who are you? - I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.
After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth.
What? [dramatic music] What the fork is a "Chidi"? Why can't I say "fork"?
In the afterlife, there's a good place and there's a bad place.
Chidi, you'll stand by my side - no matter what, right? - Of course I will.
I'm not supposed to be here.
- Wait, what? - Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu.
- Boop! - Oh! - You booped me.
- I did.
His real name is Jason.
He's a drug-dealing DJ - from Florida.
- What's up, homey? The problem in the neighborhood is me.
You can decide.
Holy motherforking shirtballs.
- This is the Bad Place.
- [cackling] Except for you four, everyone in this neighborhood - is one of us.
- You saw us all on Earth a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud.
You thought we would torture each other.
The only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.
That's it! My big mistake was having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Just gotta get the boss-man to sign off.
If this thing goes sideways again, you are done.
Do your worst.
We figured it out once, we can do it again.
Janet? Open up.
Because you know what, Michael? You basic You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
- Cool.
- I'm your soul mate.
It's who I am.
- See you soon.
- Hi there.
- [yelps] - I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.
After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth.
What the fork is a "Chidi"? Why can't I say fork? [suspenseful music] Okay, here we go.
Confidence, Mikey.
Is everything in place - for version two? - Yup! We're keeping everything from version one that made them miserable, adding a bunch of new stuff that they'll hate.
For example, all the coffee is from those little pods.
[laughs] Diabolical.
Plus, they will all have new soul mates, of course.
You gotta trust me on this, boss.
I've thought of everything.
- I won't let you down.
- I think you will.
And I have no doubt that you and your cockamamy experiment will go down in history as colossal failures.
- You know, I think if - Toodle-oo.
Okay, take two, folks.
Any last questions before we start up again? - Yes.
- Just so I'm clear: we're not pairing them up this time? Correct.
Obviously, the eventual goal is to get them to torture each other, but first we're going to create some nice, individual torment.
In version one making them soul mates, we probably bit off more than we could chew.
We could bite them? I didn't know we were allowed to bite them.
Yeah, I have some questions about my new character.
I feel like I got Real Eleanor like, I got her, you know? But this new character, "Denise" I mean, who is she? I don't get her.
Is she a quirky best friend type, or more of a femme fatale, "sexuality is her weapon of choice" type? - Both both those things.
- I have some questions about my character too.
Like - can he bite them? - No.
Okay, reminder: the most important thing tonight and this is crucial you need to get Eleanor drunk at the welcome party, so she will say and do a bunch of bad stuff.
And then we take that stuff and use it to build our chaos sequence in the morning.
For example, you remember last time, she stole all the cocktail shrimp, and we made giant nightmare shrimp fly through the sky? See, it's those details that make her realize she's in danger of being found out.
You're gonna be tempted to say, "Screw it.
Can't we just go back to HQ "and do this the old-fashioned way? "Pull out some fingernails, toss someone in an acid pit, fire up the old penis flattener?" And sure, sure, that sounds nice.
But it also sounds easy.
We're all here because we believe that there's a better way to make humans miserable.
And I I believe in you.
So, "torture" on three.
Ready? One, two, three all: Torture! - And biting! - Nope! No.
[pleasant music] Hey, lady? Can you come back? Joey? Janine? J Jaja? [scoffs] Why don't I ever listen to people when they talk about themselves? No, it's annoying, and I'm right not to.
Nice to meet you, Eleanor.
I'm Nina.
This is my soul mate, Bart.
Love it.
Love people's names and love learning all about them.
- Where are you all from? - Well, oddly enough, - I was born in Mozambique - Cool.
Listen, do you guys know if there's, like, a neighborhood phone book with everybody's name listed in it? Oh, I don't think so, 'cause, I mean, there's no phones here.
[laughs] There are no phones here? Of course.
People are like nature's apps.
Huh.
Anyway, we're on our way to get some pizza.
Would you like to join us? Maybe we could get to know each other a little bit, - chat.
- Uh, I'm good.
I'm gonna explore a little bit.
But it was so nice to meet you Nina, and B bye-bye.
[uncomfortable string music] Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.
- Oh! - Who was that mysterious gentleman wearing the nightgown? Oh, that's Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who never speaks.
Might be a little hard to get to know him.
[laughs] Eleanor you and I both know that you're not like everyone else in this neighborhood.
Everyone here led a remarkable life.
But you the work you did as an environmental activist was just extraordinary! Ah [chuckles] Well, it's the environment.
I mean, I loved, um mushrooms.
- I can honestly say that.
- Well, it paid off, because you were the number one point-getter in this entire neighborhood.
How can I say no? [laughs] Can I say no? It doesn't feel like I can say no.
But if I can: - Michael, I'm saying no.
- Okay, so, you'll speak for maybe an hour or so? Hey, you know what? I got you a little something to wear here.
Now, all the top point-getters wear these - on the first night.
- [gasps quietly] [whispering] Oh, you gotta be forking kidding me.
So, long story short, my heart is in the Pope, my liver's in the Dalai Lama, and my teeth were strung into a necklace for a child king in French Polynesia.
But it got me into the Good Place, - so can't complain.
- Wow.
- [laughs] Oh, you're serious.
Again? Right now? Yeah.
I'll catch you later! Hey there, best person! You must be Eleanor.
I'm Jessica, the host.
- Hi.
- Michael told us all about your speech.
I can't wait to hear - what you have to say.
- Me neither, Jessica.
Aw, don't be nervous.
Here.
- Liquid courage.
- Actually, um you know what? I think I need to keep a clear head.
Can you imagine getting drunk before giving a big speech? Getting kicked out of your niece's christening, and then, only later, once you've sobered up, realize you don't even have a niece.
It's like, who was that kid? [chuckles nervously] So, Eleanor, you were an environmental lawyer.
- That's fascinating.
- Yeah.
I am so sick of describing exactly what it means.
Hey, I'm headed to the bar.
Can I grab you something? How about a margarita? - No, I'm good.
- [stammers] Actually, I'm the best according to the sash.
She's still not drinking? Nope.
Something's off.
Should we - [makes chomping sounds] - No.
Keep it together.
Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.
[bright string music] These are for you.
Drink up.
Hi.
Is your name Chidi? - Yes? - Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.
- What? - Listen to me very carefully.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
We need to talk.
I can't wait to have breakfast with Kant, and lunch with Michele Foucault, and then have dinner with Kant again, so we can talk about what came up at breakfast.
I'm sorry, Chidi all the great philosophers in history [inhales] ended up in the Bad Place.
All of my heroes are Being tortured.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Actually, it is kind of clever how they punish philosophers.
Every day, they make them go to school naked, and then they take a test in a class they've never been to.
[chuckles] And then they smash them with hammers.
And that part is not so clever.
[pleasant music] No way.
Soul mates are real? They sure are.
Although, your soul-mate situation is a little unusual.
Oh, no.
I don't have one, do I? That's fine.
I mean, who needs a soul mate, anyway? My soul mate will be - books! - No, no, it's not that you don't have a soul mate, it's that you have multiple soul mates.
Here.
Now, normally, our omniscient system perfectly analyzes each person's profile, and then matches him or her with another person.
" So, how do you choose who I should be with? Oh, I don't choose.
You do, Chidi.
I [stammers] What? This is AngÃ©lique, Pedro, and Pevita.
According to the system, either Pedro or Chidi could be matched perfectly with either AngÃ©lique or Pevita.
So, figure it out.
Should be fun.
Cool beans.
One second, guys.
You you once had a panic attack at a make-your-own-sundae bar.
There were too many toppings.
And very early in the process you had to commit to a chocolate palate or a fruit palate, and if you couldn't decide, you wound up with kiwi-Junior-Mint-raisin, and it just ruins everyone's night.
Chidi, I am so sorry.
I literally cannot choose for you.
This has to be your decision.
Buddy, you gotta trust me.
I would never place you in a painful situation.
One slice of Hawaiian, straight out the oven for you.
I'm Denise.
Welcome to my pizza place.
- Thanks, Denise.
- And here's one for you.
[dismissively] Have a nice day.
It's interesting that Hawaiian pizza is so popular here.
Yeah, I guess a lot of the residents here love it.
- What was your thesis on? - Oh, gosh.
It was so boring.
It was called, "Cultural Relativism and Moral Absolutism: "An Exploration of Values As Seen Through "The Works of Alain LeRoy both: Locke and Immanuel Kant"! Shut up.
You read it? No, but that pairing is the most obvious pairing to employ in a paper with that title, - and I wanna read it so bad! - [laughing] What about Morocco? You ever travel there? [sucks teeth] No.
What about anywhere else? You been anywhere else? No.
So, first impressions? Anyone? I kind of want to hear what Chidi thinks.
Well.
Um I mean, you're both brilliant, accomplished women and Pedro, you're great too.
Ahh! [laughs] But, if I had to say who I sort of immediately bonded to, on a gut level, I think I would say that I kind of feel like my soul mate is - AngÃ©l - Wait, wait! [panting] There was a mistake in the calculations.
We had a four-hour time gap in your profiles on May 10, 2003.
I corrected that day's events for all of you, and ran the numbers again, and the final result proves definitively that Pedro is AngÃ©lique's soul mate, and Chidi, your soul mate is Pevita.
That was close.
[laughs] [groans quietly] Hey, you guys hadn't made a decision yet, had you? No! We did not.
No one said anything.
I didn't hear anything, and I certainly didn't say anything.
That's for darn sure.
See you later.
[classical music playing] This is fun.
It's a fun party.
There's no question about it, this is a fun situation.
Hey, you guys are here.
The fun continues nay, increases! [laughs] You two look nice.
Thanks! And you look [drawing out word] fine.
Would I say you look better than anyone else here? No, I wouldn't say that.
Hey, wine.
Mmm.
Do I feel like red or white? Oh, deep down in your heart of hearts, you probably already know which one you want.
Why isn't anyone talking? Janet, could you show me to the bar, please? Mm-hmm! Oh, hey! Chidi, right? Denise.
We met earlier, remember? Oh, yeah, hi.
Are you limping? Yeah, I am.
Crazy story.
See, I was a trapeze artist in an illegal circus - in Bangladesh - AngÃ©lique.
My stomach's in knots and I'm stress-grinding my teeth, and it feels like my soul is being suffocated.
You know, just your standard paradise stuff.
How about you? It's been a little uncomfortable.
I think Pedro maybe heard you say - that thing you were gonna say.
- Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
I But I have to ask.
Do you feel the way I feel? - We can't talk about this.
Hi.
Is your name Chidi? - Yes? - Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.
- What? - Listen to me very carefully.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
- We need to talk.
- About what? Just shut your mouth, smile at me, and walk over here.
Okay, you're definitely my least favorite person [in pain] I've met so far.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is really not a good time.
When I got here, some robot lady appeared out of thin air and gave me this.
- You mean Janet.
- Oh, that's it! Janet.
- Hi there.
- Not now, Janet.
- Buzz off.
- Okay.
- [short beep] - Now, I have no memory of writing this, but it is my handwriting.
Her name is - Janet.
- Hi there.
- [gasps] Fork off! - Okay.
- [short beep] - From the second I got here, these nerds have been acting real weird, trying to get me drunk.
My soul mate ditches me every time I try to talk to him, and this Zen-master guy gave me this magic bracelet thing, and then he just ran away.
Something very strange is going on here, and the only person I trust is me, and me told me to find you.
So what's the deal? What's happening? What do you got? Uh I can't [stammers, laughs] Look, I'm I'm sorry, but none of this means anything to me, and I've got my own problems to deal with.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Come on in.
You're in the good place, Tahani.
Ooh, what a surprise! [laughs] But yes, I accept.
This is your soul mate, TomÃ¡s.
Now, TomÃ¡s was a doctor with the International Rescue Alliance, and you raised money that ultimately funded his medical missions.
It's just so perfect! - Aww.
- It's lovely to meet you, - Tahani.
- Charmed, I'm short.
It's so cozy.
[laughs] I feel like the walls are just hugging me.
- [laughs] - Michael, I don't mean to be rude, but this is simply absurd.
Yes, thank you.
I didn't want to say anything, but There's only two of us, and we don't need all this space.
- "All this space"? - Oh, of course.
You two humanitarians don't want anything so extravagant.
I'll just get rid of the second floor.
Well certainly is quite quaint.
So, it's just fun.
I daresay even quite charm ah, no.
- What's the matter? - Sorry, it's just a self-portrait of my my sister.
Wonderful.
Your sister is Kamilah Al-Jamil? I used to play her music for my patients.
At times, it felt like Kamilah's songs were curing the malaria for us.
[chuckling] Great.
- Can hardly wear a day dress - to an evening event.
- Sounds good.
I'm ready whenever you are.
- Is that what you're wearing? - Oh, yeah.
My years treating remote villagers taught me to favor comfort over style.
But you should wear whatever you prefer.
Well, I mean as we are soul mates, perhaps I-I should also dress down.
[classical music playing] You all right, my dear? [chuckling] Yes, just not used to dressing like a plumber-ess.
Relax.
Feel the breeze on your feet.
That's why Crocs have holes in them.
I'll get us a drink.
Lower that beautiful face for me, won't you? - Lower-lower-lower-lower-lower.
- Okay.
Muah! Tahani? You all right? Michael, hello! Yes, I'm having a splendid time.
Although, if I'm being honest, a few aspects of my day have been sub-optimal.
But the system matched you and TomÃ¡s, and the system is never wrong.
But guess what? This is the Good Place.
If you want your house to be larger, then just ask.
Do you want something this big? Or maybe bigger, like the Taj Mahal.
I know, I know.
How about a moon? Would you like to live on your own private moon? No, no, no.
My house is wonderful.
And really, it's so silly to want a bigger house of all things, here in paradise.
But if you change your mind, just ask.
Because all the other residents are very happy, so it'll give me plenty of time to deal with whatever requests you make.
No demand is too what's the word? Oh, "frivolous.
" Okay? Wow.
That is rough.
Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.
[bright string music] These are for you.
Drink up.
How about you? Okay [mouths word] Crocs also?! - [glass ringing] - Speech time! I know you're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet, but if you are, please get me out of this speech.
I've asked our top point-getter, here, to say a few words.
So, take it away, Eleanor! [applause] The dictionary defines "best" - as being - [slurring] Oh, God, boring! I'd like to say a few words if nobody minds.
[whispering] Thank you, wizard.
I am Tahani.
Tahani am me.
And even though I wasn't the "number one point-getter," I just wanted to welcome you all to the neighborhood.
You all look so beautiful tonight, with your regular-sized pockets and regular-sized soul mates.
Why don't you try to ease her off the stage - and take over yourself? - The point is, we're all good people, right? We all did the right thing whenever we could.
And that's why it's so nice to be here among you, in this massive house that I want.
I want this house.
Give it.
[laughs] No, I'm just kidding.
But really, give me the house.
Hey there, hot stuff.
Can I get you a cup of coffee? Get your hands off me! Oh, you think you're better than I am, don't you, just 'cause you're wearing that.
[rushing sound] [door clicks open] Jianyu? Come on in.
[pleasant music] Before we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk who kept a vow of silence.
Would you prefer to remain silent here as well? Every resident here in the Good Place has a soul mate.
Now, some of the pairings are platonic, some are romantic, but what you have with your soul mate is unique.
You have a spiritual connection that transcends the physical realm.
This person's gonna be your best bud.
[chuckles] Jianyu, let me introduce you to your soul mate, Luang.
He is also a Buddhist monk, from the Lumbini zone of Nepal.
Okay, I'm gonna let you two get acquainted.
I'm sure you have a lot to not talk about.
[laughs] Because well, you get it, you get it.
[ambling music] [sighs] [ominous music] Oh sorry, I didn't see you.
Chidi? Are you Chidi? [otherworldly ringing music] - Eleanor? What are you up to? - Oh, hey there, Michael.
Just getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.
- Ah.
- Who was that mysterious [pleasant music] Hello, you beautiful spirits.
Now, she can get you literally anything you want.
All you have to do is ask.
Of course, you two won't ever want anything, because you're perfectly content.
Oh, I know.
How about something special? Janet, two yak's milks, please.
Enjoy.
[short beeping] [short beep] - [glass ringing] - Speech time! - If we all just - Well give it to me! [shouts] [guests gasping] I got her off the stage.
Tahani? - Are you all right? - Yes, fine.
You'll have to excuse me, 'cause I've got to go, so Oh, look! I've got some shrimp.
In one of my many, many cargo-pants pockets.
[sobs] What the fork is happening? [rushing sound] Okay, here we go.
- How's it going, boss-man? - Enough chit-chat.
Is everything in place for version two? Yup, I've thought of everything.
I won't let you down.
I was just hoping that you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party.
You know, just to introduce yourself.
[laughs] How about something special? Janet.
Two yak's milks, please.
Why isn't anyone talking? Janet, could you show me to the bar, please? Mm-hmm.
Michael, may I please speak with you privately? Sure, sure.
It just feels like I used to be Real Eleanor, - and now I'm Denise.
- Denise is a good part, with a a great backstory.
You run the best pizza place in the neighborhood.
You have a cat, and that's cool.
And now, AngÃ©lique gets to torture him? AngÃ©lique is a hack.
I can act circles around her! But I have nothing to do! I am a Ferrari, okay? And you don't keep a Ferrari in the garage.
I hear your concern.
I do.
And I promise you, there is a great arc coming for Denise the pizza lady - in about 80 years or so.
- [sighs] Chidi is going to accidentally kill your cat.
It's gonna give you a great chance to shine.
Can I just have something that makes me stand out? A mysterious past, or a limp! - I want a limp.
I'll tell you what.
Go nuts, all right? Limp your heart out.
Oh, hey! Chidi, right? Hi.
Are you limping? - How's it going? - [sighs] We're having some trouble with Eleanor.
She's not engaging in conversation, - she's not drinking.
- Eleanor's not drinking? She brought a flask in the car during her driver's test! Okay, we need to keep things moving here.
I'm about to make her talk for an hour.
She'll definitely end up insulting somebody.
Never better.
You'll have to excuse me, 'cause I've got to go.
[mumbling discreetly] - What the fork, man? - I know that book.
Is that some kind of nerd pick-up line? Because it's only kind of working.
No the note you showed me before.
All right, this is from a book called "What We Owe to Each Other.
" I used to teach it.
I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
Okay.
- I have never seen you before in my life, but I think somehow, that we know each other.
[soft music] That definitely sounded like a pick-up line.
- [sighs] - And I'm not not interested, but we need to figure this out first.
- [groans softly] - It's not that bad, right? I mean, we got a drunken speech.
That's good.
No.
It isn't.
Okay, we can still salvage this.
- Where's Eleanor? - She's gone.
- I can't find her anywhere.
- Maybe she left with Chidi? - He's gone too.
- What? Or maybe she left with Jason.
You lost Jason? How is that even possible? You're only job is to stand next to that idiot.
I got distracted by the fire! I love fire.
You know, my main job is to burn people with fire.
- No, I didn't.
You said that if Eleanor tries to confess that she doesn't belong here, find a reason to avoid her, like saying, "I'm going to the gym," so that's what I've been saying.
That was a suggestion of the type of thing you could say! Don't How many times have you specifically told her you were going to the gym? Five.
- No, nine.
- You dimwit! Hey, man! I was perfectly happy in my old job in the twisting department.
People came in, and I twist them until they snapped in half, and I move on to the next one.
But this job is weird! It's all talk, no twisting.
So if you don't like the way I do it, get somebody else.
You go to the gym.
Okay, we can still pull this off, we just need to find the four humans.
Okay? Okay.
[chuckles] Right now.
Everyone in this room, find those four humans! Are you gonna talk, or just walk around like a nerd trying to get a personal best on his Fitbit? I'm sorry, I'm trying to process a tremendous amount of insane information.
I mean, you're not supposed to be here, but you and I clearly met here, somehow, before now.
I mean does that mean that I'm not supposed to be here? I don't know, dude.
Were you a good person on earth? I I think so.
[sneaky music] - Uh, Janet? - [short beep] - Hi there, Jianyu.
- Hi, Janet! Um, can I tell you something? - Sure.
- I'm not Jianyu.
And I'm not a silent monk.
My real name is Jason.
And I don't know what's going on.
I got here and Michael said I'm a monk, and he told me I was gonna have a new best friend, and that we were gonna live in a yogurt.
- A yurt.
I don't wanna go back to my yogurt.
- Can I go to your house? - I don't have a house, Jason.
I live in a boundless void.
- Can I go there? - No.
It's a boundless void.
- Okay.
- So, what you're saying is, there are certain aspects of your existence here in the Good Place that are confusing for you, and you're searching for someplace to go where you feel less lonely.
I know somewhere you could go.
- Okay! Okay! Okay, so, if we got all the way to Scanlon, we must have been studying very intensely for a very long time.
Or, you grabbed a random book of mine and just tore a page out.
I'm gonna be honest, that sounds more like me.
[knocking at door] Ah! Eleanor and Chidi.
What a pleasant surprise.
I'm so happy you two have met.
I'm just going door-to-door, apologizing for the commotion earlier tonight.
- Ah.
We are doing just fine.
Oh, good, good.
Glad to hear that.
Well, it's getting late.
Chidi, allow me to escort you back to your house.
- Um - Uh, hello, all.
Sorry for the late hour, Eleanor.
I wanted to stop by and give you back your sash.
No! I don't deserve it.
I made a complete fool of myself tonight.
I interrupted your big speech, badly stained my cargo pants, which, I have to admit, are quite comfortable.
Oh, God, what's happened to me? I'm praising off-the-rack separates! Tahani, please.
It's late.
- I think what we should do - No.
Look, ever since I got here it feels like something's been off.
Tahani.
That's her soul mate? Is there a second one of him that stands on his shoulders? Chidi! There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.
Okay all right, everybody.
Now we are really imposing on Eleanor here.
Chidi, let's everybody take off Hi, Eleanor.
This person would like to speak with you privately.
About something.
Oh, really? - Yup.
Could be the key to this entire mystery.
Luang, perfect.
Why don't you take Jianyu back to your yurt, - right away.
- Homey, no! I'm not spending another second with this loser.
You said he was gonna be my best friend, but he is not.
My best friend from Jacksonville was named Pillboi, and he was dope! We would talk together, get high together, throw old batteries at drones together.
But this guy can't hold a camel to Pillboi.
Okay, I no longer think he's a wise monk, and I'm pretty sure this is just a piece of garbage.
Can I guess? You've been worried sick about me.
I'm headed to the gym.
Sure, why not? - I'm quite confused.
- Let me explain, gorgeous.
I don't know what this place is, but it is certainly not the Good Place.
Michael is forking with us.
- Like a prank show.
- Yeah, like a prank show.
Janet.
Her name is Janet.
- Oh, right, Janet.
- Hi there.
- Hi Janet! - Hi Jason.
[cackling] Are you kidding me? Eleanor Shellstrop, you sneaky little so-and-so.
That was some very quick thinking.
I'm extremely impressed.
But you're not gonna be so lucky next time.
- Next time? - What? - Yeah.
[laughs] - He's gonna do it again! That's not gonna work this time - dummy.
- Okay, excuse me.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
I demand to speak to your superior.
I am so sorry, madam.
Please forgive me.
I'll prove it to you.
Janet! - [short beep] - Hi there.
Hi, Janet.
Open your mouth please.
Thank you.
[skin squelching] See, no notes.
No clues or loopholes nothing in there! Thank you, Janet.
So, let's all just pretend the last attempt never even happened.
And he completely understood.
[chuckling] As a matter of fact, he found the whole thing kind of funny.
But he was very supportive, and he says he's very excited for us to get going again.
So, anyone else? Anybody? No? Then let's get out there and make some miseries! Testing, one, two, three [digital beeping] - Hey there, boss-man.
- You were supposed to call me - this morning, give me an update.
- Oh.
[laughs] Right, sorry.
Yeah, it's just the the chaos sequence was going so well better than the first time, in my opinion.
You know, even flashed somebody, so we had a lot to work with.
So, attempt number two is on track so far? Oh, smooth as silk.
Everything's great.
- [tortured screaming] - Oh! Sounds like everything's going well back there too.
We're trying out the new butthole spiders.
- Ah! - They're enormous.
You know, good old-fashioned torture the way it's supposed to be.
Good luck with attempt number two.
Come on in.
This is daily notes log for attempt number three of my neighborhood experiment.
Obviously, I hope and assume this will be the final version.
No, I know it will be.
All the kinks have been worked out.
This is the one.
And after I pull this off, they're gonna hang my picture in the Bad Place Hall of Fame right next to the guy who invented bees with teeth.
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
I'm your soul mate.
Bring it in, man.
Sorry, I must ask, why are you wearing a sash that says "best person" on it? Apparently, I am the number one points-getter in the entire neighborhood.
Is that so? I always have to have my sashes custom-made due to my height and bosom size.
Also, apparently, sashes are out this season.
The diagonal line really draws one's eye to the chin bloat.
Go fork yourself, you mean giraffe.
Run! Giraffes! Giraffes! Run! Oh! Mean giraffes are destroying the neighborhood.
Gah, still not used to it.
Hey, what if I, an already amazing person who definitely belongs here, wanted to learn even more about how to be a good person? Is one of these nerds, like, a teacher or a life coach or an Instagram fitness model or something? Eleanor, I'd like you to meet Chidi Anagonye.
Chidi, this is Eleanor.
Janet tells me you were a professor of some kind.
Yes, I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy focusing on deontology.
Hang on one second, Cheebee.
This guy's too big of a nerd.
Who else you got? - Michael, what do we do here? - I don't know.
I'm too young to die and too old to eat off the kids' menu.
What a stupid age I am.
I'd never survive down there.
They should take Eleanor.
She's a pear shape.
- She'd fit right in.
- Oh, excuse me.
You wish you could have a bite of this pear.
You guys can stay.
- Chidi, you're not going.
- No, I have to go.
Holy forking shirt.
You guys, don't you get it? Michael is torturing us.
That's why our lives have been so miserable since the moment we got here.
This isn't the Good Place.
It's the Bad Place.
Let's focus on the positives.
Eleanor always hates her house.
Tahani always hates Eleanor.
Jason hates being quiet.
Chidi immediately gets a stomachache.
So there's a lot to work with here.
Hang on one second, Cheeto.
So it's gonna be a hard pass on Superdork Jones over there.
My soul mate has some sort of surprise planned for me, and he seems very excited about it.
Well, you two are certainly getting along very well these days.
Yeah, I'm actually kind of into Sebastian lately.
I mean, he's a little hokey, but he's growing on me a little bit.
My love, my sweet dewdrop I have written you a three-hour Spoken word jazz opera Cool.
Eleanor, less and more Who's it for? For you, my dewdrop cream of the crop Top to the bop to the bop to the top - Okay, no, no.
- What? No version of heaven for anyone would ever include three hours of this.
We're in the Bad Place, aren't we? Damn it.
No, no, no, no, Michael, please, please, please! Please don't kill me.
I have so much to live for.
I'm sorry, Janet, got to reboot you every time I start over.
Oh, I know.
I'm not actually upset.
It's just the automatic fail-safe mechanism that kicks in every time you approach the plunger.
- Go ahead.
- Ah.
Attempt 99.
Attempt 108.
I've analyzed some recent data.
Eleanor always seems to realize that they're in the Bad Place - just at the moment that - Excuse me.
Sorry, the door was open, so I just came in.
Did you just say I'm in the Bad Place? Attempt 109.
I've closed and locked the door.
Uh, yep, and we're ready to go.
This is your soul mate Tahani.
This is your soul mate Lerf.
This is your soul mate, a golden retriever.
Hang on.
Wait a minute.
You know what? Holy smokes.
This is the Bad Place.
This is the Bad Place! This is the Bad Place.
This is the Bad Place! Bees, bees, bees, bees.
Oh! Oh, this is the Bad Place.
Shh! Michael, Michael, if I'm gone, who will take care of my birds? Michael, no, no, no, no, no! I I'm pregnant.
And it's your baby.
I have tickets to "Hamilton" next week, and there's a rumor that Daveed Diggs is coming back.
Janet, we've been through this hundreds of times.
I mean, can you just chill out? Is that possible, Janet? Can you just chill out a little? Nope, it's gonna be the same every time.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
All right, okay, calm down.
Calm down.
I mean, why even bother at this point? I'm obviously never gonna get it right.
"I'm Eleanor.
I'm so smart.
I'm actually in the Bad Place.
" Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Shawn still thinks I'm on version two.
And I'm really fat right now.
I'm stress-eating, and I'm gaining weight in my thighs.
I mean, look at that.
Ohh.
So sorry.
Who are you? And where am I? It doesn't matter.
This one doesn't even count.
Hang on one second, Chili.
Michael, you simply cannot expect Chidi to decide whether Eleanor goes to the Yo, yo, homies, check it.
There's something messed up with this place.
We keep fighting with each other.
None of the TVs get the NFL RedZone channel.
My soul mate doesn't even know who Blake Bortles is.
I know this sounds crazy, but I think we're in the Bad Place.
Jason figured it out? Jason? This is a real low point.
Yeah, this one hurts.
We're a week in.
Chidi's teaching Eleanor, but she hates it.
Tahani still thinks that Jason's a monk.
Everyone's miserable.
I'm so happy.
Fingers crossed.
Vicky, where is everyone? They're not coming, Michael.
You have lost control of this experiment, so we are on strike until our demands are met.
We can barely remember what we're supposed to be doing anymore, plus I spent weeks perfecting this excellent Australian accent, I did.
And then I never got a chance to use it.
You're still upset about the size of your part? Yes, I want a more important role.
But that's just my demand; all 318 of us have something we want to do differently.
Some people want bigger houses.
Gayle wants a different backstory where she was an MMA fighter? Gunnar wants to bite and/or nibble on humans while they sleep.
You do know, Vicky, that if I were to do some of these that it would be a dead giveaway? And I can help you explain that to them.
But some of these are doable.
The last thing I remember you saying is nothing.
Can you start from the beginning? Okay, I need a little break.
Can we take a walk or something, maybe get some clam chowder? - Where is everyone? - Who knows? Maybe they finally figured out clam chowder is disgusting 'cause it's basically a savory latte with bugs in it.
Is someone smoking a cigar? Michael really screwed this up.
The regular Bad Place was fine.
If the four-headed flying bears ain't broke, don't fix 'em.
What was wrong with impaling? I loved impaling.
Hey, Todd, got a light? Uh, yeah, obviously I have a light.
Those suits are really itchy for us.
Who even cares if they see us? They're just gonna get rebooted anyway.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's just hot ocean milk with dead animal croutons.
Okay, but what do we do, panic, freak? I usually panic, but I am happy to freak.
No.
We have to stay cool.
As my mom always used to say, if a cop handcuffs you to a bike rack, there's always something you can gnaw through.
Your mom always said that? Think.
Come on, brain.
- Janet! - Hi, there.
Janet, can we, like, leave the neighborhood, get as far away as possible? Is there anywhere we can go? So we're in the Bad Place, and I know why: almond milk.
I knew it was bad for the environment, but I loved the way it coated my tongue with a weird film.
Who else is being tortured? Are we the only two? I got to assume Jason is as well Jianyu.
You know him as Jianyu, but his real name is Jason, and he's a dirtbag from Florida.
- What? - Also, Tahani is a candidate as far as I'm concerned.
Yesterday, she told me that she was Taylor Swift's best friend but Taylor Swift wasn't her best friend.
She sucks.
No offense, but I can't believe you and I ended up in the same place.
- You - We're here.
Aren't trains neat? Choo-choo.
Hi.
You gotta help us.
I'm Eleanor.
This is Chidi.
And see, we thought we were in the Good Place, - but as it turns out - Yeah, guys.
I know.
Mama needs her medicine.
We've met before? - I'm Janet.
- I know.
Vicky, let's look at the big picture here.
Now, if you all can just stick with my plan and we pull it off, we'll be heroes.
You could write your own ticket.
You might even land the Jared from Subway account.
Yeah, but I don't think you can pull it off.
You're gonna reboot those four dum-dums one more time, and then I'm taking over.
I'm going to execute my version of this neighborhood.
You see, I've been working on it while all of your versions fell apart.
This is insubordination.
And if you do not do what I tell you immediately, you are going down.
That's a complete report of every mistake you've made, every screw-up, every reboot all laid out in excruciating detail.
Now, I'm sure your boss would love to hear all about how "attempt number 2" is really going.
So actually, if you don't do what I say, you're going down.
Usually Chidi's in the mix.
Sometimes Jason is here.
One time, Jason and Tahani were here.
But you know what? No matter what the combo is, I always ask you guys to bring me cocaine next time, and you never do.
Do you have anything I can snort, like a crushed-up aspirin or some eye shadow or cocaine? Still no.
There's only one question we need to answer right now, and that is, what do we do next? I mean, this place doesn't seem terrible.
- Maybe we should just stay here forever.
- Maybe we should just stay here forever.
I mean, sometimes you go back because you feel bad your friends don't know what you know.
Sometimes you go back because you walk in on me while I'm masturbating, and sometimes you go back because I walk in on you while I'm masturbating.
But no matter what, you always go back.
You formulate a plan to defeat Michael, and you head back.
Okay, a plan.
We need a plan, but - What if we come up with a plan - What if we come up with a plan - we've already tried before? - we've already tried before? - Will you please stop that? - Will you please stop that? Yeah, just to help you out a little, I've written down every plan you've ever come up with, which obviously never worked, because you're here, and you're back, so good luck.
"Physically attack Michael.
"Seduce Michael.
Use her powers.
" Oh, I'm guessing that was Jason.
That guy has no idea what's going on.
Hello? Hello.
Where is everyone? - Janet? - Hey, there, Jason.
Oh, hey, homey.
Uh, I mean Jason? Who is Jason? I am a monk.
You know what Can I talk to you for a second? I'm in a tight spot, and I could use someone to bounce some ideas off of, okay? Oh, yeah, real quick, you're really in the Bad Place, and you're being tortured.
Maybe under a bigger bus.
What do you think? I think this is pointless.
We're trapped in a warped version of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.
Oh, cool, more philosophy.
That'll help us.
Well, don't you see the problem? We are experiencing karma, but we can't learn from our mistakes, because our memories keep getting erased.
It's an epistemological nightmare.
Ugh, even your nightmares are boring.
And you are so irritating! In one of these reboots, I probably strangled you and then went to the Even Worse Place, but you know what? I bet it was worth it.
Oh, nice.
Ugh! Sorry, can I just vent to you for a second? Chidi is so annoying.
I just I cannot believe that he is the one I'm stuck here with.
Uh-huh, wow, crazy.
Oh, sorry.
Jeez, man, I thought you could be human for, like, two seconds and listen to me.
I have, Eleanor.
You two, you got it bad for each other.
No, we don't.
Chidi's just a friend.
What am I saying? He's not even a friend.
He's just a weird teacher that I hate.
Dude, I do not want to watch "Cannonball Run 2" right now.
All right, what happened in the first one, so I'm all caught up? I don't know what's gonna happen to us, but I need to tell you something.
I love you.
Oh, that's real, baby.
That's real nasty.
Yeah, this was, like, the sixth time you guys were here.
I saw you getting sexy the previous three times, so I cut a little hole in the wall so I could tape you.
Call it my lookin' hole.
Is that a camera? Mindy, you pervert! How many times have Chidi and I slept together? 8 different days, but, like, 20 different sessions.
And how many times did we say that stuff? Oh, only once.
Oh, God, I hated it.
It's, like, anti-porn.
I've only ever said "I love you" to two men my entire life, Stone Cold Steve Austin and a guy in a dark club who I mistook for Stone Cold Steve Austin.
I mean, why would you show me that? I don't know.
You guys are, like, trapped here together.
I feel bad.
You know, I'm rooting for you guys.
No, there is no "us guys.
" We basically just met each other.
Also, it doesn't matter if I told you that or not, because when Michael finds out he's failed again, he'll just reboot you.
Chidi, Janet, we're leaving.
I am taking this with me.
Oh, no.
It's my only copy.
Don't.
How did it come to this? I was just trying to do something innovative and different that would improve the way we make humans' lives miserable for eternity.
Mm, well Shut up.
But I can't ignore her or she'll rat me out to Shawn.
I'm trapped.
You're saying a lot of words right now, and I only know some of them, like "rat" and "Jason," but I know a little wisdom I can give you.
I know everything that happened in your life, and it was all stupid, so I highly doubt that.
I was a member of a 60-person dance crew in Jacksonville.
We were called Dance Dance Resolution: We Resolve To Dance.
One day, Donkey Doug and I got into a fight because I'd framed his girlfriend for boogie board theft, so he started a new dance crew called Hashtag DougLife and immediately challenged us to a dance-off.
He said, "Meet us inside the abandoned orange juice factory at midnight.
The end.
By Jason Mendoza.
You know, that inane story actually contains a bit of good advice.
Thank you, Jason.
You got it, homey.
I give good advice.
Guess that's why I'm in the Good Place.
Oh, there you guys are.
That's right.
We know his name is Jason, not Jianyu.
We know everything.
I don't understand much of it, but, yeah, I know it.
Your sick torture plan is not working, okay? 'Cause we keep figuring out your little puzzle.
We're winning, which means you're losing.
So you have two choices here, buddy: keep failing over and over or realize we're actually the ones with all the power here.
Yeah, no, uh We're on the same page.
So what do you say? New best friends? Stop it.
We're on the same page.
I wanna team up with you guys.
What? Why? You do? What? I'm in a bit of a bind and I could use some backup.
So, what do you say? New best friends? You wanna team up? You've been torturing us - and lying about it.
- Let's not get all caught up on who lied to who or which one of us created an entire fake reality in order to cause eternal misery for the others.
That's ancient history.
It was happening until 20 seconds ago.
I love being on teams.
Oh, we need a team name.
Um the Bobcats.
- Great.
- Slow down, ding dong.
He wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.
He needs us.
- Why? - Because, as you said, you keep beating me.
- Fun? - Today, there was a new development that really chapped my nips.
One of my employees is blackmailing me.
Vicky.
She runs the clam chowder place in the main square.
- A Little Bit Chowder Now.
- Oh, the place with the the chowder fountain.
No, that's Pump Up the Clam.
A Little Bit Chowder Now has the lazy river of chowder.
I am supposed to reboot you, erase your memory and turn control over to her.
How are we supposed to team up with you if you wipe our memories again? Easy.
I'm not going to.
You're going to act like you've been rebooted and pretend that Vicky and the others are torturing you.
But then, on your own time, in private, you can study ethics, ogle mailmen, - do whatever you want.
- Can I play iPad? - Sure you can, buddy.
- Yes.
Guys, there's no debate here.
If he finds out, we're all in hot water.
Literally.
They will boil us.
We will be the main ingredient in a chowder of pain.
Human meeting.
Bedroom.
Now.
Oh, yeah, um, that no stair thing, that was part of the torture.
- Anyone have any ideas? - You know, believe it or not, I actually found myself in a very similar situation a few years ago, except in that instance, Michael was Javier Bardem and the Bad Place was Vanessa Redgrave's panic room.
Okay, stop talking.
Do not talk again for 100 hours.
- What do we do? - We team up with Michael.
Okay, hot take, but I like your confidence.
- Tell me why.
- He has a bow tie.
Oh, no.
So I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona and the guy paid me the $600.
My point is, you always trust dudes in bow ties.
[grunts] Ahh! Look, Michael's a liar.
I know liars.
It was my job to trick people into buying fake medicine and I was the top salesperson - seven years in a row.
- I thought you only - worked there five years.
- Proves my point! This is a trick.
- There's no way we trust him.
For all we know, you three are in the Bad Place and I'm up in the Good Place, where I belong, being tested.
- How would that even - I don't know, - but it's possible.
- Before we do anything, we need more information.
We should ask him every question we can think of.
- Yes.
- Yes, we shall grill him like the flank of a Niberian piglet.
I'm sorry, has it been 100 hours? [bell dings] Okay, man.
We got questions.
Logically, you shouldn't but you have no choice.
I mean, I wouldn't, if I were you.
It's a crazy thing to do.
- But you gotta.
- What happens if we don't? Most likely, I reboot you once more, you figure it out again, Vicky tells my boss, he shuts everything down.
I get punished, you end up spending the rest of eternity in the real Bad Place, up to your necks in a volcano full of scorpions.
I'll tell you what I want to know right now before we go any further.
Did the Jacksonville Jaguars win the Super Bowl last year? [chuckles] Oh, you're serious.
But no.
[laughs] They won't.
Okay, well I just have, like, 12 more Jaguar questions No, you don't.
Hey, Janet? - Hi, there.
- Do you have something shiny Jason can play with? [gasps] How many different versions of this place have we been through? Uh, let's see.
802.
The longest one was 11 months.
Uh, this current one has only been going for one week.
What's that super tiny line? That's the shortest one, eight seconds.
It was a butt reboot.
I sat on the activator by mistake.
Michael, was I also rebooted 802 times? Yes.
Why? Every time a Janet is rebooted, she increases her social awareness and abilities.
I might be the most advanced Janet in the universe.
So Janet isn't with you.
No.
I guess it didn't work, though.
Because you keep failing.
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.
If you're not human, why do you look like us? Everyone in the Bad Place Bureau of Human Affairs gets randomly assigned a human body so we can get the feel of how best to torture you.
I gotta say, it took me a long time to get used to - the hanging bits.
- Gross.
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter, Eleanor.
Clair's is fake, I bet.
No, the Medium Place is real.
So annoying how you managed to slip away from me - all those times.
- Why even tell us about any real thing? Why not just lie about all of it? Lies are always more convincing when they're closer to the truth.
That's true.
I crashed a lot of open bar weddings as Eileen Shelbourne.
Even dated a groomsman for a few months.
So I had to keep the name, and he got Eileen - tattooed on his neck.
We're running out of time, and I'm your only option.
We're running out of time and I'm your only option? A lot of guys your age said that to me just as the bar was about to close.
But I never settled for them.
Because my ex-boyfriend lived nearby, he was obsessed with me and he never slept because he was addicted to Adderall.
There is always another option.
You guys do whatever you want.
- I'm out.
- No! My plan only works if all four of you - are on board.
There's a way to get to the real Good place.
It's complicated.
It may take a while to arrange especially since I'll have to do it in secret but yes, yes, there is a potential method of transportation.
Wait, is it nice? Is there a business class? Can I pre-board? Yeah, let's not worry about that right now.
I can get us there.
Us? You, Mr.
Diabolical Torture Guy are gonna try to join us in the Good Place? Yeah, if I stay in the Bad Place, I'm doomed.
But if I rescue four pitiful, foul-smelling humans from eternal damnation hit 'em with the big puppy dog eyes.
Will they even let us stay? I gotta be honest, I have no idea.
But at least if you help me fool Vicky, your brains don't get erased every two weeks.
Okay, all humans who have not already been suckered by Michael, another team meeting.
This is definitely a trap.
We figured out his game every time and now he's just trying a new way to mess with us.
Teaming up with a demon is insane.
Maybe.
But I think we have to do it.
You understand that, right, Tahani? I understand nothing.
Hey! Same here! Michael, there's been a mistake.
I belong in the Good Place.
The real one with the good people.
Who do I speak to about correcting this? Me and you're wrong.
Very well.
I would like to speak to your manager.
Listen, sweetheart, you've only been in this timeline for about a week.
You never cared about the people you were helping.
You did it only for fame or status or to spite your family.
That is utter tosh! I had my flaws, just like anyone else, but I raised billions for charity.
I was a good person and I defy you or anyone else to prove otherwise.
You know, in all the reboots, I never showed you how you died.
I was saving it in case I ever needed to really make you miserable.
But it's hilarious.
Of course, I mean sad.
" - Tahani, welcome.
- Oh, it's such an honor.
I have long dreamt of being one of the women or yachts who grace your cover.
Let's begin with your sister, Kamilah.
A woman who as you know was offered the spot on our cover, but turned it down.
I actually didn't know that.
Please, carry on.
Well, next week, Kamilah will travel to Cleveland, Ohio to become the youngest person ever inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.
As you know, she released her debut album only six months ago and yet, the critics thought it was so brilliant that the Hall of Fame decided to waive its 25 year waiting period.
Sadly, I will not be attending the ceremony because I will be in Haiti on a relief mission.
Perhaps we should talk more about that.
Perhaps we should.
But first, another question about Kamilah.
Don't you think she and I would be friends? We have a lot in common, we are both Capricorn, and we're both only children.
I'm sorry, I forgot about you.
[upbeat club music] Kamilah! Congratulations.
- Who are you? - Really? Good Lord.
Tahani! You're a cocktail waitress now.
Honestly, I think this is the right move for you.
No, it's just that my own sister didn't even deign to invite me to her little soiree.
So I had to weasel my way in here like some common weasel.
But I was supposed to be in Haiti being photographed helping people, but instead I delayed my trip by a day to come here and tell you off.
No, you came to do what you always do: make a scene and embarrass yourself.
So I'm just an embarrassment to you? Is that what you think of me? Honestly, I don't really think about you.
Come on.
Come on! Come down to the ground where you belong, will you [screams] - Oh, no.
- Mm.
I died in Cleveland? I don't think that should be your biggest takeaway - from that story.
- Is that really all I cared about? Just outshining my sister and gaining praise and acclaim? I mean, I did gain praise and acclaim.
You know, I dare say on some occasions, more praise and acclaim than my sister, Kamilah, so Oh.
Oh, I see.
- Oh, God.
Imagine you're me and you're designing a torture chamber for people who think that they belong in the Good Place.
I mean, you were perfect.
But I've always wanted to be perfect at something I just never thought it would be the perfect stooge.
I want to do it.
I want to become the person I pretended to be.
I agree with Chidi.
We should team up with Michael and all try to build a better Tahani.
Great.
Why am I the only person who clearly sees - what's going on here? - It's not that we don't understand the risks, we just wanna become better people and this is our best chance.
Oh, I get it.
'Cause you're so much better than me.
- That's what this is about? - Hang on, don't lash out at us just because of - your innate distrust.
- Lash out? No, it's not about who's better.
[crosstalk] I have no idea what's going on right now but everyone else is talking - and I think I should too! - [laughs] What is so funny? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing.
How do I explain this? I'm basically an exterminator and you're cockroaches.
My job was to squish you and poison you and yet, somehow, my very survival now depends on you, the cockroaches, agreeing to help me.
Or dung beetles.
I don't know.
Something small and gross that creeps on the ground in its own filth.
- Just being honest.
- [laughs] Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- All right, forget about him.
- Oh! Forget about him, focus on us.
Kant wrote it is our duty to improve ourselves.
I need to just untangle all of this.
Give me a minute to think about it alone.
Okay.
[circus music] - Janet? - Hi, there.
Call me a train.
Fill it to the brim with cocaine.
I'm going back to Mindy St.
Clair's house.
Okay.
I'm going to Mindy's.
I don't want to live forever in a boring, beige house with a weird, horny cokehead, but look at what you're asking me to do.
Make a deal with an actual devil so that I can then do homework in secret.
And by the way, you're not my friends, man.
We've known each other for, like, a week.
You know it's more than that.
We've been through some version of this 800 different times.
- Look, bro, I don't owe you anything.
I gotta do what's right for me.
You can come with me if you want.
I got another mop we can put in the bed.
Good luck.
[melancholy music] I got a couple more questions.
Sure.
Take your time.
He always helped you.
God.
- Really? - Yep.
No matter how I set it up, you found him, confessed you didn't belong, asked him for help, and he said yes.
Now his agreeing to help was part of my plan.
What wasn't part of my plan was it actually working.
Drove me nuts.
Pesky little nerd.
No.
No, no, no.
It's that you never found a haircut that framed your face properly.
- Yes, your selfishness.
- I'm not that selfish.
Eleanor, your cocaine and escape train are ready.
- Not now.
- Okay.
But he's asking us for help, so we should help him.
Because that's what Chidi would do.
That's what Chidi would do for me or for any of us.
- It's what I am doing.
- I know.
It's just you're talking about me like I'm not here or something and that just makes me feel weird.
All right.
We're all in.
On one condition.
You wanna be on our team, you gotta be on our team.
Which means the professor over here is gonna give us all lessons on how to be better people.
Including you.
Oh, no.
No, I won't be taking any classes.
I'm an immortal being with abilities you can only dream Yeah, and we're in Arizona, dirtbag.
A human turtleneck, a narcissistic monster, and literally the dumbest person I've ever met.
We are all going to improve.
And the second you betray us, I walk into Vicky's stinky chowder restaurant and tell her everything.
You agree to those terms, and you can join us on Team Cockroach.
So what's it gonna be? You're running out of time.
And we're your only option.
[chuckles] So it's all frozen yogurt places now, huh? Yeah, yogurt was what we started with.
A lot of us like the first version best so we went back to 322 perfectly matched human souls, blended together in a blissful, harmonic balance.
- Well done.
- Right? I'm a pretty good liar.
Now I wanna introduce someone that you're gonna get to know very well.
She was the top point getter, so she'll be helping me out around the neighborhood, kind of like your mayor.
Vicky Sengupta! [applause] Vicky, would you like to say a few words? Actually, Michael, I'd like to sing a few words.
Janet, hit it.
[Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive"] At first I was afraid, I was petrified Kept thinking I could never live Without you by my side We should have a few hours to ourselves.
Vicky's working on her performance for the welcome party tonight.
It looks like pretending to enjoy her singing is gonna be half our job here.
Whatever bad stuff you do becomes the basis for the chaos tomorrow morning.
Okay, okay.
So my job is to get drunk and insult people.
I think I can hack that.
Now, Chidi, I'm gonna need you to act nervous and embarrassed by Eleanor.
- Way ahead of you.
- Tahani, just be your fabulous self.
And Jason, you're good old silent Jianyu the monk.
Even though that's transparently insane.
Cool.
And, um, Janet, you're not gonna - rat us out, right? - Well, Jason, I've been thinking about this a lot over the last 1.
3 milliseconds, I'm not allowed to lie, but my purpose is to make humans happy.
And since you're the only actual humans here, I'm on board for whatever fun little schemes you guys come up with.
Okay, bring it in.
Team huddle.
The Bad Place is about to be outsmarted by a cowardly traitor, four dum-dums, - and a robot.
Team Cockroach on three.
One, two, three.
- All: Team Cockroach! - Bobcats! I still think that's better.
 [quirky music] You've got to admit things are going pretty well since I took over.
Certainly a lot smoother lately.
And based on my surveillance, our four humans don't suspect anything.
Yeah, because we're killing it.
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
[groaning] So long.
You're not supposed to be torturing me.
From now on, make all your memos one page max with pictures.
Also, Quinston over here already came up with a sick idea for how to torture Tahani.
Tell him, babe.
We're going to have Tahani throw a party for Gunnar's birthday, but no one will show up because we'll also be throwing a party, and it will be way better.
Boom.
[laughing] Where do you get these incredible ideas? Oh, that one just came to me.
Up top! So that's their plan.
This doesn't seem so bad.
It really tucks my nuggets.
I worked so hard on my torture ideas, and theirs are so basic.
These millennials, they have no work ethic.
Oh, sorry, a millennial is someone who has only been torturing people for a thousand years.
[soft voice] A millennial.
Okay.
Except for, you know Is that what we should call you? "Demon"? Well, I mean, it's not really accurate, and we consider it to be a little racist.
But it's fine.
Well, um, let's start our first lesson.
Tahani and Jason will have to make it up since they're both off being fake-tortured.
All right.
Well, I've read everything on your syllabus, and how do I put this delicately? It's all, ah, stupid garbage.
Look, we have to start somewhere.
So how about Socrates? All right, all right.
"Oh, and look, my arms end in stupid little sticks.
" Okay.
Proceed.
Good.
This is so depressing.
I'm being forced to throw a party that I know will fail.
That's why they're doing this.
It's what you're best at.
Vicky may be some demonic torturer from the netherworld, but does she have taste? Sophistication? An encyclopedic knowledge of traditional and avant-garde Belgian floral design? Yes! She does.
No.
She doesn't.
What if I throw a party that is so amazing that it's actually better than the party that's supposed to win? When they realize they could have to my party, they'll be sad.
I won't be sad.
They'll be sad.
- Janet! - Hi there.
Janet, when I turned 18, I knelt in front of Princess Grace's dress mausoleum, and I swore to uphold the Hostess Code: "I, Tahani Al-Jamil, "shall do my level best "to make every event too much.
[laughs] [sighs] Man.
Michael is not into your class.
Right now, I'm the best student.
I'm going to be the velociraptor.
You trying to say "valedictorian?" No.
Look, dude, this isn't your fault.
You've been teaching him ethics for half an hour, and he's been evil since the beginning of time.
Oh! Maybe the reason Michael can't latch onto the ideas is because he's immortal.
You tell a lie, who cares? Wait a few trillion years, the guilt will fade.
Before I can teach Michael to be good, I have to force him to think about what we used to think about: that life has an end, and therefore our actions have meaning.
That's what you used to think about? I used to think about how it's weird they don't make pants that are just one big pant leg for both your legs.
You mean a skirt? No.
You're not getting it.
And my thing is different, so shut up.
- Michael? - Yeah.
Is there any way that you can die? Yeah, actually there is.
My essence would be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle, and every molecule of my body would be placed on the surface of a different sun.
Sure.
So is that what would happen if your boss found out that you defected to our side? Yeah.
Okay, so that might actually happen, and if it did there would be no more Michael.
Think about that for a second.
Imagine being retired.
Everyone else is here.
But you? Poof.
Inky black void.
Done.
Okay.
I'll think about that.
[daunting music] Huh.
So you're saying that I would be No Me? [wailing] Okay! Now we're getting somewhere.
Dude, you broke Michael.
No, no.
It's a sort of anguish people go through when they contemplate the silent indifference of our empty universe.
Look, the good news is, if he can work through this, it's the first step towards understanding human ethics.
And what if he can't? Then, he'll be a lifeless shell of misery forever, and we're all doomed.
Okay, I will be right back.
Gotta go grab some Camus.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing? Can I get you a snack? Do you eat? I can never remember.
What do you eat? Babies? Do you want me to get you a big fat baby? What flavor baby? [gasps] How about a Cool Ranch baby? Searching for meaning is philosophical suicide.
[cartoon playing on TV] Eleanor, baby, I have some sad news.
Your doggie, Max, has passed away.
Do you know what that means? Well, sometimes when a dog is very old, like, five or six or something, he crosses a long rainbow bridge, and at the end of that bridge is a beautiful farm with lots of grass and trees and, I don't know, wagons and a rainbow.
I already said "rainbow.
" The point is: that's where Max is.
Can we visit him at the farm? Nope, because it's very far away in Guam.
- It's in Guam.
- Can we at least Okay, look.
The farm is made up.
The bridge is made up.
There's no such place as Guam.
Your dog, Max, is dead in a duffel bag under the deck.
How did he die? The short answer is: I don't know.
And the slightly longer answer is: I didn't know how hot it gets in cars sometimes.
The point is: don't be sad.
Honestly, I'll get kind of annoyed if you do get sad because it's been a very long day and that bitch Carol from work was really on my ass about some stupid thing that I don't even know what it was.
I would say I outdid myself, but I'm always this good.
So I simply did myself.
[sighs] Everything is perfect.
Red alert, red alert.
We need help.
What's wrong with Michael? Uh-oh.
I know that look.
He just snorted a bunch of printer toner.
No, no, this is more like a philosophy overdose.
Basically, Michael just smoked a big bowl of ennui, and now he's having an existential crisis.
So, we need to cheer him up.
Look at how pretty the restaurant is.
Didn't Tahani do a good job? Parties are mere distractions from the relentlessness of entropy.
We're all just corpses who haven't yet begun to decay.
Yeah, but balloons! Okay, we all head over to Vicky's party together.
We babysit Michael in shifts so that no one sees he's a catatonic blob.
[laughs] Unless I am sorely mistaken.
- [lively music] - [people cheering] I'm taking you, baby All the way to lovey town I was sorely mistaken.
Okay, bud, whatever is going on right now, just shove your feelings way down deep, plaster on a fake smile, and pretend you're having fun.
Okay? Just like I used to do when someone started talking about their kids.
Hey, welcome, guys.
Wow, this is elaborate.
Gunnar was an animal rights activist.
So the theme of the party is "animals.
[people laughing, dogs whining] That's fun.
Oh, and have you ever wanted to sit in a kangaroo pouch? My whole dang life.
So we can all hang out here for a bit and then we can head over to your party sound good? Yo, this place is lit.
I'm going to go jump in that kangie's pouch.
Hey All right, Tahani, you just need to walk around the party looking miserable.
Great, just like that.
Perfect.
And then Chidi and I will keep an eye on Michael.
You okay? Okay? I'm a new man.
Oh, Eleanor, thank you so much for the advice about shoving my feelings down deep.
I feel so much better.
It's like I'm surfing on this wave of positivity.
Is that Janet? Oh, yeah.
Have you met my secretary, Jeanette? She's a lot like Janet, but she doesn't pretend like she has all the answers.
Hi, Jeanette.
Oh, no, it's still me Janet.
Babe, we need to get some food into you.
Get you something to eat.
I don't eat anything.
She's perfect.
Hey! Turn that around.
Throw them dice, baby It did kind of hurt actually, but I love it.
So he's moved on from existential crisis to just straight-up mid-life crisis.
That's good, right? I knew a ton of guys like that back in Arizona.
" Oh, so cool.
No, no.
This is worse.
I mean, an existential crisis is an acknowledgement that life is absurd.
And that absurdity needs to be confronted, but this is just denial.
And at any moment that denial could collapse, and he'll be a mess.
He is a Jenga tower of sadness.
For an immortal being, he's pretty fragile.
Yeah, well, I know you guys weren't super close, but still.
It's hard losing a parent.
Eleanor! Mommy's here, baby! Oh, and who is this tall drink of wine? This is my boyfriend, Sam.
Sam, this is my mother Sister! Sister [groans] It's not going to work.
It's my ex-husband's funeral.
Thanks for blowing my cover, Doug! Listen, baby.
Don't be sad, okay? Your father wasn't great.
Let's call him what he was: a fart in the shape of a man.
I'm just saying he sucked.
I mean, the only photo they could get of him was a mug shot.
He was a doof.
So don't be sad that he's gone.
I'm not sad.
I'm fine.
Good! You know, I had a long running bet with Eleanor's father that I would outlive him.
You want to guess who won that one? Come on, guess.
[chuckles] Is there a bar? I'm just going to [sighing] Did my mom slip you her hotel room key? Yes.
Yes, she did.
[glass clinking] Thanks so much for coming to Gunnar's birthday party.
Now, there was a little bit of a mix up, and Tahani also planned a birthday party over at the restaurant.
So why don't we all head over there? No need.
This party is far superior.
I'm sure yours is amazing.
Well, I did fine on the dÃ©cor, but I don't have, you know, actual unicorns you can ride.
Let's all get back to the party, then.
Hang on, there, mis amigos! - Whoo! I want to make a toast.
- No, no, no, Michael, oh, boy.
Okay, I know what you're thinking.
Birth is a curse, and existence is a prison.
But don't think about that.
Don't be sad, you guys.
Focus on something great like Drakkar Noir whoo which I am wearing a lot of tonight.
I'm going to do some push-ups.
Then we'll go around the room and name our favorite cheese.
Okay, that's good with the speeches.
That's good, yeah.
Let's all get back to the party.
What was that? You didn't run any of that by me.
Oh, I know, I know.
I'm sorry, babe.
I'm not about that negativity.
Mi torture es su torture.
I am so happy you're in charge.
Okay, well, good.
Namaste, chica.
[laughs] Do you want to dance? - No.
- Okay.
I'm leaving.
This party is way better than ours.
Why are you miserable? Ohh.
You stay and have fun.
I'm going to go and throw myself a pity party though I doubt I can even throw one of those properly.
[whimpers] [indistinct chatter] [glasses clink] God, I love this stuff! [slurps] Oh! Let's keep this party going! What now, huh? Want to hit the clubs? Oh, oh, oh Vegas! No, no, no, even better Dubai.
[gasps] Jeanette, make us a Dubai.
[giggles] I kind of feel like maybe we should wind down, have a No, no, can't do that.
Can't stop moving.
Oops.
I'm thinking about it now.
Yep, thinking about death again.
Oh, I know.
Jeanette and I have been taking samba lessons, huh? - Let us show you how to do it.
- Okay.
I think Vicky bought his excuse, but we need to snap him out of this.
Which one of these confusing French books will make him normal again? It's not that easy.
Were you? I mean, you never had one moment where you were freaked out by the permanence of death? Never one moment like that? Hey, man, you got toothbrush holders? Sure, yeah, right over here.
What's this? Who has four toothbrushes? Like, Bill Gates or something? No, that's like, for a family.
Family? Like, a whole family and their toothbrushes all together? Two slots for the parent toothbrushes and two slots for their kids? Yep.
So the parent toothbrushes can be close to the kid toothbrushes and watch over them and [sniffs] They can all talk about their toothbrush feelings.
And they can hold their little toothbrush hands when they're sad? Make sure no harm ever comes to their little bristles? - Sure.
- [crying] Oh, um, do you need Kleenex? Thank you.
[sniffles] Sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.
All humans are aware of death.
So we're all a little bit sad all the time.
That's just the deal.
Sounds like a crappy deal.
Well, yeah.
It is.
But we don't get offered any other ones.
And if you try and ignore your sadness, it just ends up leaking out of you anyway.
So don't fight it.
In the words of a very wise Bed, Bath, and Beyond employee I once knew "Go ahead and cry all you want.
But you're going to have to pay for that toilet plunger.
" I got you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
[sniffs] I just want to sit and stare at nothing and silently scream for the rest of time.
I might be way off-base here, but you seem kind of bummed.
I really thought I could throw a better party than a magical, all-powerful being.
Whenever we auditioned a new dancer, we would rate them in five categories: dancing ability, coolness, dopeness, freshness, and smart-brained.
I would give you an eight in every category.
Well, eight isn't bad, I suppose.
No, no.
Eight is the best.
It was a scale of 1-13, but eight was highest.
The scale went up and then back down like a tent.
Why? It's not important.
Which is worse than an eight? That's so unnecessarily confusing.
The point is: you're cool, dope, fresh, and smart-brained.
I've never seen you dance, but I bet you're good.
'Cause you're good at everything.
You're awesome.
Be nicer to yourself.
Thank you, Jason.
[light music] From one eight to another.
"Eleanor continues to be a selfish monster creating burden for Chidi.
" "Selfish monster?" I brought you back from the brink of an existential coma, dude.
No, no.
I have to embellish your misery on these fake torture reports so that my boss doesn't get suspicious.
But really [sighs] I am grateful you pulled me out of my funk.
Well, now that you've become acquainted with existential crises, I thought we could read "Death" by philosopher Todd May.
Sounds like the perfect beach read.
Should we wait for Tahani and Jason? Where are those goofballs? So, um we should probably discuss That was awesome! It was.
- Sure, but, Jason, we should - Okay, be right back.
[playful music]
This is an exciting day.
We are going to tackle The Trolley Problem.
Is this a game? I go first.
I call blue.
There's no this is No, this is a thought experiment first introduced by British philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967.
You are driving a trolley when the brakes fail, and on the track ahead of you are five workmen that you will run over.
I see the irony.
Keep a-swipin'.
You don't know any of the workers.
Okay, well, then that's easy.
I switch tracks.
Kill one person instead of five.
But this is hard because the only trolley I've ever been on is James Franco's ironic trolley.
It travels backwards from his penguin grotto to his garage of adult tricycles.
Let's say you're a doctor, and you can save five patients.
But you have to kill one healthy person and use his organs to do it.
But that's not the same thing.
Why not? It's still choosing to kill one person to save five, isn't it? Michael, you've been kind of quiet.
What do you think about all this? Well, obviously the dilemma is clear.
How do you kill all six people? So I would dangle a sharp blade out the window to slice the neck of the guy on the other track as we smush our five main guys.
Oh, I did the thing again, didn't I? - Yep.
Ten more, buddy.
Why is that so hard to remember? People What is it? - Good.
- Good.
Cool.
Later, guys.
Oh, hey, twerps, we have an hour before we have to pretend to be tortured by Vicky.
You want to hang out? We could work on our forced grins.
Check mine out.
[forced laugh] This place is miserable, etcetera.
Sorry.
Jason, do you, um, care to join? Sure, dog.
You're doing extra-credit work? What can I say? This class is more fun than I thought.
[mellow music] Eleanor seemed a little suspicious earlier, snooping around.
You didn't tell her about us, did you? No.
Why are you so scared that someone will know we're pounding it out? Precisely because you refer to lovemaking as "pounding it out.
" Who cares about what other people might think about us being together? Maybe you should talk about this with a friend.
But then that person would know we were together.
But then that person would know, and I don't want anyone to know.
I know.
I'm saying you should talk to someone about how weird it is that you don't want to talk to someone about how we're together.
How's it going, teach? Hmm, kitchen looks nice and crazy.
I've been racking my brain, trying to find a way to get through to Michael.
What do you think about writing a rap musical about Kierkegaard? I think that's a terrible idea.
Cool.
- [sighs] - Michael's not going to learn how to be a good person overnight.
Teaching him to be good it's like teaching me how to be not hot.
How would you even do it? You'd have me hunch or something and then stand there and say "gurp, gurp, gurp"? I don't even know.
I can't even picture it because I've been hot my whole life.
I'm sorry.
Who is this conversation for again? It's for you.
I believe in you, nerd boy.
If you can teach me and Jason ethics, you can teach anybody.
Thanks.
- No.
- No! Right? [laughs] No, it felt like a no when I was doing it.
[quirky music] - Janet? - Hi, there.
If I were to tell you something personal about myself, you couldn't tell anyone about it, right? Right.
So, in a way, you're sort of like a therapist.
Absolutely not.
A therapist is a trained medical professional with the ability to absorb and process complex ideas about human emotion.
I am simply a vessel containing all of the knowledge in the universe.
Okay.
Obviously, no one can ever know.
I mean, I wouldn't shag Jason if he were the last man on Earth.
But well, he sort of is, and I am shagging him, I mean.
And I think I'm losing my mind, so please help me.
Well, my job is to make your experience here in the afterlife more enjoyable, so I will try to help you.
I am going to need some time to read every book ever written about human psychotherapy.
And now I've done that, so let's begin.
I just want to have a little chat about your progress.
In the last homework assignment, I asked you to examine the ethics of "Les MisÃ©rables," in which a man steals a loaf of bread to feed his starving family.
Would you please read your first paragraph here? "Everyone in this story sucks and belongs in the Bad Place.
"The thief is bad.
The officer chasing him is bad.
"All the whiny prostitutes are bad.
"Plus, they're all French, so they're going to the Bad Place automatically.
" Do you see how you're already off topic? Chidi, I've been around a long time like, all of it.
Sure.
But philosophy is about questioning things that you take for granted, and I-I just don't think that you're doing that.
I mean, "I personally know that Victor Hugo "is in the Bad Place being tortured.
"He's a real wuss, too.
"If one of the lava monsters even gets near the guy, "he's like, 'SacrÃ© bleu, I peed in my pants.
'" I don't know what you want from me.
T-that's exactly what he said.
Jason's a nice person, but my suitors were always of a certain echelon.
I mean, I've dallied below my station.
I once had a brief fling with a non-famous Hemsworth brother, but even Larry Hemsworth had more status than Jason.
Jason didn't even have a job in a sad way, not in the good, rich way.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing? Sitting in a room? That's pretty cool.
I took your suggestion, and I'm talking to Janet about our relationship.
Actually, it might help me if I could hear Jason's side as well.
Oh, no, no, no.
He thinks that I have to control everything and that he has no voice in this relationship.
Right, Jason? Good.
Now, where were we? I just heard that.
Okay, fine.
I'll leave.
I just don't feel like you're engaging with the material like with The Trolley Problem.
That was just tricky.
That's all.
This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
I'm on your side here, dude, but he is not wrong.
Okay, Michael trust me.
When it comes to human ethics, I just know more than you.
I've been studying it my whole life.
It's just that it's so theoretical, you know? I mean, you know, maybe there's a more concrete approach.
Here, let's try this.
[snaps fingers] [trolley droning] Oh, God! Michael, what did you do? [trolley bell ringing] I made The Trolley Problem real so we could see how the ethics would actually play out.
Make a choice.
T-the thing is, I mean, ethically speaking No time, dude! Make a decision! Well, it's tricky! I mean, on the one hand, if you ascribe to a purely utilitarian worldview [crashes, wheels screeching] Okay.
So what did we learn? Chidi? Talk it out, buddy.
What are we thinking? He thinks he just killed a bunch of people with a trolley.
It's just a simulation.
I would never make you kill real people.
Oh, well, that's reassuring, because some of the parts of the fake people flew into my mouth! Michael, can we just go back to the classroom? We never left.
Here, I'll show you.
Well, they're fake people, but their pain is real.
Does that make sense? There have to be stakes, or it's just another thought experiment.
This is awful.
You specifically asked me if there was a way I could connect with the material more.
I'm trying, you guys.
Sorry.
You're right.
I want to help you understand this.
No, the whole point is to play out the scenario in real time.
Quick, Chidi! What's your decision? Okay.
Okay.
I can do this.
I am choosing to switch tracks, so that way, I only kill one person.
Oh, forgot to tell you.
This is the scenario where you actually know one of the people.
It's your friend Henry there.
My boots are stuck in the tracks.
- Henry, move! - Anyway, long time no [screams] Oh, my God! [wheels screeching] Again, just a simulation an almost impossibly lifelike simulation.
Would someone's foot really fly off their body like that? That was kind of cool.
Ethically speaking.
Tahani's confusing.
She's really smart.
And she's all soft and smooth like a bunch of water balloons.
But I tell her she's pretty a hundred times a day, and she's never said I'm pretty once.
It's my turn.
I have a lot of problems, too, you know.
Perhaps we could kill two birds with one Janet, as it were.
How would you feel about giving Jason and me couples therapy? I'd feel great.
[quirky music] Janet, what's happening? Unclear.
My guess is I'm operating in a way I'm not designed for, and it's creating a small glitch.
But if I'm helping you guys, I say "What has one thumb and wants to keep going?" This not-lady.
Eh? Eh? [mellow music] Okay, so that was Trolley Problem version number seven.
- You might be right, Eleanor.
- Thank you.
Let's try the doctor one.
[snaps fingers] Dude, what the fork? These five people all need organ transplants, or they will die.
Eleanor's perfectly healthy.
Chidi, do you want to slice her open and use her organs to save the five sick people? Chidi, Chidi, think about this.
I'm your hottest friend No, Tahani.
I'm your nicest fr No, Jason.
As a doctor, I've taken the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm, and although five people will die, I cannot harm one innocent person to save them and forsake my oath.
It's unethical.
Okay.
- Tell their families.
- What? Doctor Chidi? My daddy needed a heart transplant.
Did you save his life? He was working, then a really bad man ran him over with a trolley.
Oh! Come on! What? I'm finding this incredibly helpful.
I think I'm really starting to get it.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Hey.
Are you torturing us again? What? You don't care about learning ethics lessons.
You're just torturing Chidi again, aren't you? - Busted.
- What? [laughing wildly] I'm sorry.
Old habits die hard.
Not as hard as those people you crushed with the trolley, though.
Boom! I'm sorry, is this funny to you? Yeah.
My bad.
Look, I'm still on your team, okay? I just needed to let off a little steam.
Phew.
[snaps fingers] See? Back home.
All good.
No.
No.
Not all good.
I'd rather just be tortured than choose it.
You are no longer welcome in my class.
Get the fork out! [dramatic music] - But I said "my bad.
" - Out! You okay? You've been staring at the second page of this book for an hour.
When I'm really upset, concentrating on a table of contents helps me calm down.
It's like a menu, but the food is words.
Oh, okay.
I can't believe I actually thought he wanted to learn from us.
Right.
I'm sorry about this, Chidi.
I made him take the classes, and I feel a little responsible.
Oh, no, it's not your fault.
Yeah, you're right.
It isn't.
And no take-backs.
No, a tiger can't change his stripes.
Gross.
Also, I really don't think that's true.
Oh, no? What possible other reason could he have to behave that way? Actually, I can think of one.
Yesterday Tahani gave us her reasons not to take this relationship public.
Tahani, what do you value about Jason? Well, he's thoughtful picks flowers and brings them to me.
Often they're ones I've just planted, but That's how I know they fresh.
He's the least self-aware person I've ever met.
He has massive amounts of unearned confidence and is utterly unaware of his own absurdity.
I'm nice to you, and you're mean to me.
There's something wrong about that, but I can't put my finger on what it is.
Oh, Jason.
I genuinely like you, but it's hard to change all at once.
Can you give me a little more time? Okay.
I agree to keep this on the DL for now, if you agree to grab my butt in public once a week.
You can say I sat in gum and that you're trying to scrape it off.
You do sit in a lot of gum.
Look, I don't know what to tell you.
If Chidi can't take a joke, that's on him just like all that blood was.
[chuckles] I can't high-five that! No matter how badly I want to.
Look, this isn't about Chidi not being able to take a joke.
This is about you.
You're doing what I used to do.
You're pulling an Eleanor.
Posting my cousin's credit card number on Reddit because she said I looked tired? - [snorts] - [chuckles] [laughing] I forgot I did that.
Pulling an Eleanor in this case is lashing out when you feel like a failure.
You couldn't hack the classes.
They made you feel dumb and small, so you took it out on the teacher.
You think I feel dumb and small? I'm an eternal being who can see in nine dimensions.
I can see from your aura that you're about to fart quietly and then lie about it.
And please don't, because I can also see what you ate today.
Dude, you can bluster and insult all you want also classic Shellstrop moves, by the way but deep down you know I'm right.
Whatever.
[chuckles] You and I are really very similar.
What does that say about me? Ugh.
Look, bro, it's 100% on you to make this up to him.
[soft music] I screwed up.
I'm owning it.
I mean, I'm a superior being I ought to act like one, right? So I really thought about each one of you, and I got you something that will make you happy.
I call them "opposite tortures.
" Do you mean presents? Yes, that's better.
[soft ding] Holy mama.
Is this a diamond? Yeah.
Honestly, I don't get the appeal.
Diamonds are literally carbon molecules lined up in the most boring way.
They're worthless space garbage.
What you're holding right now that's basically meteorite poop.
[squealing] And I have the biggest piece! Eleanor I had Janet make you a never-ending shrimp dispensery.
- [gasps] - [soft ding] [chuckles] - [machine whirring] - Oh! [laughing] This is the dream.
[gasps] Pikachu! Guys, it's Pikachu! - This is awesome - [balloon pops] Aw, man.
And finally, Chidi.
You were a tough nut to crack, but I think I figured it out.
[soft ding] This is a replica of a lost notebook from the desk of Immanuel Kant.
It contains never-before-seen thoughts and musings and several, uh crude erotic doodles.
Interesting guy, actually.
The point is, no one on Earth has ever seen this except for you.
Cool.
[mouth full] Yeah, we can't be bought.
What do you want from me, man? You want me to give you a golden nameplate for your office? Or you want a diamond bigger than Tahani's? No! Then this would be worthless.
I don't want anything.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
Ah, I get it.
I get it.
You want me to admit that I was wrong.
"And, oh, please help me because I feel so so lonely and vulnerable.
" Yes.
Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry.
I, um I didn't understand human ethics, and you do.
And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out.
And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.
Have a seat.
[sniffs] Whoo-hoo! Nobody try mystery flavor.
Our relationship has grown so much stronger over the past few weeks, and we owe it all to you.
Congratulations.
I am very happy for the both of you.
[loud rumbling] - Okay.
Bye.
- [soft ding] [chandelier rattling] [rumbling stops] [soft ding] Hi, there.
What's happening? What's wrong? I am wrong.
I can't stop glitching.
I fear this neighborhood is in danger of total collapse.
So that's the main thing.
How are you?
[quirky music] - Hello.
- [shouts] So sorry.
To activate your Janet, press nose for three seconds.
Okay, okay.
Um, can you walk yet? Here.
Shh.
- Hello.
- Shh.
Hello, I'm Janet.
I really need you to shut up.
Where did you get this? Did you actually get into the Good Place somehow? Didn't need to.
They keep their Janets in a neutral pocket dimension beneath the shapeless time void.
It's right next to Accounting.
I understand that you need the four humans to think they're in the Good Place, but using an actual Good Place Janet seems risky.
Why don't you just have a Bad Place Janet pretend to be good? I thought about it, but watch.
Bad Janet? What up, skidmarks? Let's try that thing again where - you pretend to be a Good Janet, okay? - Aww.
Now, really really try your best.
- Fine.
- Say, Janet, where can I get some delicious ice cream? Oh, there's a wonderful parlor in the middle of town square.
My favorite flavor is rocky road.
It contains chocolate ribbon, marshmallows, and your dad's salty nuts, you fat dink! I see what you mean.
Wait a second, Janet.
What what are you What are you telling me? Are you saying that because you're glitching out The neighborhood is in danger of total collapse.
Fun fact: mathematically, it's equally likely to either im- or explode.
[laughs] Okay, okay.
So I suppose the next question should be, "What's causing the problem?" Unclear.
The glitches started out small, and then began to escalate, and then I came here looking for help, and then I started talking, and then you looked at me annoyed, like that, and now here we are.
Okay.
All right.
You got it.
A little short on time here, Janet.
It's just a little hard to get out.
Almost got it.
Here it is.
My user manual.
Okay.
Let's get started.
" And I need to skip ahead here.
Where's the, uh, troubleshooting part? - Michael.
- Hmm? What's with the earthquake? Janet's experiencing a slight technical issue.
Ew.
What's wrong with it? Oh, um, uh I tried to eat some frozen yogurt.
It looked so good, but I'm not supposed to eat anything.
So there was a little earthquake.
[rumbling] See? There it is again.
First you went rogue at the party with your sports car and your weird earring - [laughs] - And now Janet's breaking down? I mean, it's like you're begging me to tell Shawn that you're incompetent.
Begging.
Vicky, this is a temporary problem.
I promise.
Hey, you know who could use some torturing right now? Chidi.
- Oh.
I love torturing Chidi.
- I know.
Picture this.
Needles.
Oh, that's the whole idea.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Needles.
- Genius, right? - Yeah.
I mean, needles.
Oh, wonderful.
- Yeah.
Needles.
Yeah, run with that.
Okay, hopefully bought us a little time.
Where were we? Uh Oh, here we go.
Yeah.
"Glitches.
"In the event of malfunction, run the following tests/ First test, basic corporeal function.
99.
7 trillion degrees.
A little bit on the high side, but no biggie.
And still no blood.
Oh, thank goodness.
Okay, what's next? "Summoning and retrieval.
"Have Janet produce an object using the random object generator program.
" Okay.
"Lordy, Lordy, I'm Over 40.

Okay.

"Glitches may be a sign that your Janet is processing "or disseminating information that is incompatible with objective truth.
" They're talking about lying, Janet.
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
Hello.
I'm Janet.
And I have now been fully activated.
Hello, Janet.
I'm Michael, a Good Place architect.
One of the best.
Happy to meet you, Michael.
I will help you make the perfect neighborhood.
Would you like to get started? Uh, one small note there, Janet.
Uh, the neighborhood that I want to build might be a little different from the ones that you might be familiar with.
Is that all right? Of course, silly billy.
I build and operate the neighborhood, but every aspect of the design is entirely up to you.
For example, if you'd like me to stop calling you silly billy, just say so.
Yeah, I don't like that at all.
I lied to you.
I lied about who I was and what we were doing, and then I lied a billion more times to support that first lie.
And now you're all discombobulated.
This is my fault.
Nope.
You're wrong.
If the glitching was only a result of you lying to me, why wouldn't I have been glitching all along? Why would it only be starting now? Well, that that's a good point.
I know, right? - [knocking] - M Excuse us, Michael, but we've been trying to call Janet and she isn't answering.
Uh, yeah.
I had to take her offline for a system check.
She'll be available real soon.
Cool, because I'm just so freaking excited, because Tahani said she's never had jalapeÃ±o poppers, and I wanted to get some for her.
They sound so disgusting.
But if Jason likes them, then maybe I will too.
Because we are together.
I can finally admit that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You two are sleeping together? Only when we're done having sex.
Anyways, Janet, can you help us? As soon as Michael puts me back online, I'd be more than happy to help you get that extra special gift for Tahani.
[quirky music] - Whoa.
- What's happening? Oh, boy.
What the? Oh, man.
We got robbed! They took the walls, they took the floor, and we were standing here the whole time? These guys are good.
Michael, what do we do? Okay, there we go.
Perfectly normal.
Let's go.
Is Janet going to be all right? Totally fine, please just go back to your house and wait for her there.
She'll show up shortly with lots of jalapeÃ±o poppers.
- And cheesy fries? - Mm-hmm.
- With donkey sauce? - Sure.
- And a cool hat? - Ding dong.
So I don't seem to be getting better.
- That's the good news.
The bad news is, I seem to be losing my ability to sustain object permanence.
So it's sort of a glass half full, glass stops existing in time and space kind of deal.
Okay, let's walk through what just happened.
Jason and Tahani came in, revealed the crazy fact that they're now in a relationship I already knew that, and I'm so happy for them.
[retching] Janet, tell me a lie.
Janets can't lie.
You lied to Vicky earlier.
I suppose after 802 reboots, I must have gained the ability to lie.
That's fun.
I want to try to lie again.
I love your outfit.
[thuds] [quirky music] "Incompatible with objective truth.
" Janet, the problem isn't me lying to you, but rather you lying to other people.
Like when you said to Jason, "I'd be happy to help you and Tahani.
" That was a lie.
- That's my main purpose.
- I know, I know.
But it was still a lie, even though you didn't intend it to be, because you weren't actually happy to help them.
Because you're in love with Jason.
Say what now? After the very first time you were rebooted, and as you were slowly regaining your knowledge, you bonded with Jason.
The two of you got married, and I think, somehow, you're still, deep down, in love with him.
Ha! No, that is impossible.
Think logically.
And the third glitch the earthquake? When I said I was happy that I'd helped improve their relationship.
Ohh nuts.
Yeah.
But I am happy for them.
I am.
I am.
Am I? I am.
I am not.
I am not happy for them.
[gasps] But how is this possible? I don't have any memory of being married to Jason.
You said yourself that Janets get more sophisticated every time they're rebooted.
Well, maybe you falling in love with Jason was some sort of mutation that then was amplified with each reboot.
Okay.
That makes total sense.
I know what you have to do now.
Kill me.
[clears throat] You have to kill me, Michael.
Better? Janet, I can't reboot you.
That will just intensify your feelings for Jason.
And that's what got us into this mess in the first place.
I'm not saying reboot me.
I'm saying set me to self-destruct.
"In the event of continued malfunction, "hold down Janet's nose, and insert paperclip into small hole behind left ear.
" Yeah, right here.
" I'm very high in potassium.
Like a banana.
"A new Janet will need to be procured in order to return the neighborhood to functionality.
" Easy.
I'll be gone, you'll get a new Janet, and everything will go back to normal.
Well, not for me.
I'll be a lifeless marble floating through space, but you'll be back to normal.
Are you sure this is what you want? To self-destruct? What I really want is to stay and serve the neighborhood, but due to my feelings for Jason, I'm putting him and everyone else at risk.
A little busy here, bud.
Yeah, totally.
Totally.
I don't want to be a nudge, but is there anything else coming down the pike that you forgot to mention? I honestly don't know, but I have bigger fish to fry.
So you, know, just just walk it off.
I would love to walk it off, but my feet have needles in them.
Don't know what to tell you.
Okay, but Okay, self-destruct time.
I won't feel any pain or anything.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill I really don't want to do this, Janet.
But I suppose it makes sense.
Great.
Grab a paper clip.
Should I begin to welcome the residents? No, no, no, wait, wait, wait! No, this is all wrong! Pudding restaurant? What even is that? Pudding won't work! It's okay, Michael.
Just relax.
I can't, Janet! My design has to be perfect for me to to In order to accomplish what I need to accomplish.
Oh.
Whoa, I'm way out on a limb here.
And I'm all alone.
No, you're not.
You have me: Janet.
Try me.
[laughs] All right.
Fine, fine.
Um Janet, uh What's a food that people think they enjoy but that's also kind of a bummer? Frozen yogurt.
[whooping] Oh, yes! [laughs] Frozen yogurt.
Oh, Janet, you're a genius.
Correct.
But why do you want a food No, no, don't don't worry about that.
- Okeydokey.
- [chimes] [laughs] Would you like to try it? Oh, yeah.
It's just okay.
Which means it's perfect.
Let's bring in the residents.
I don't know what just happened, but I'm happy you're happy.
Michael.
Hmm? Oh, sorry, yeah.
Oh.
I can't do it.
Come on, dude.
It's dangerous, is what it is.
Vicky could find out, and then the you know, the plan, the whole plan It's bad for the plan, Janet.
That that's the reason.
I don't understand.
Given the situation, it's far safer to initiate the self-destruct.
And without you, we stand zero chance of ever making it there.
The new Janet will be able to help you with that.
Well, all right, but it's not only that, though.
See, it's also because of, um What if Vicky found out? You already asked me that.
Why are you making such a big deal about turning me into a marble forever? Because of reasons.
There are reasons.
They exist, and I just don't want to explain them right now.
What are the reasons? They're reasons, Janet! Okay, but what are they? The reason is friends.
We have been through so much together.
I mean, yeah, sure, for you, you know, each time I rebooted you, you met me all over again.
But for me, our our relationship has become important.
You're my oldest, my truest, my most loyal friend.
I can't just get rid of you and replace you with some other Janet I don't even know.
[paperclip clatters] Well, well, well.
Yeah, don't don't do that.
Lay off.
I'm glad you said that.
Well I mean it.
Look at us.
A couple old pals.
Trying to make our way in this crazy world that I built.
Two peas in a pod.
One of whom needs to kill the other one immediately.
Michael, come on.
No.
There has to be another way.
This problem you're facing, it's about emotion, right? That's a human problem.
So maybe we should consult our most problematic human.
So, let me get this straight.
You want me to convince Michael to turn you into a marble because you're causing earthquakes because you're sad about Jason to whom you were once married because he's currently sleeping with Tahani? - Correct.
- I don't think I've ever meant this literally, but that might be too much information.
First of all, I totally get the Jason thing.
But more important, what you're going through is something every person has gone through.
Not a person.
Actually, right now, you kind of are.
Because you just found out your ex is dating someone else.
And, yeah, it sucks.
But trust me, it's not worth all this drama.
You just need to get drunk and go dancing.
You'll forget all about Jason.
Do that.
Pop a couple magnets, listen to some No Doubt, dye your hair.
You'll be totally fine in, like, two seconds.
I mean, honestly, the best move is to get another dude and just go to town.
Rebound guy.
But I guess here, your options are pretty limited.
- What about Michael? - Extraordinarily bad idea.
Yeah, right.
You're awesome.
You contain all the knowledge in the universe, you have a rippin' bod, and you can literally do anything.
This is just a blip.
So, was it helpful? Yes.
Eleanor told me that instead of being sad, I should go get it, girl.
So I'm going to go get it, girl.
- Get what? - Unclear.
I'll get everything, just to be safe.
I'm so glad we're friends.
Me, too.
And since we're friends, I can tell you this honestly.
Take that outfit out of rotation.
It makes you look bottom heavy.
It does, doesn't it? Ugh.
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go to my void for a little while.
I just need to spend some time alone and focus on myself.
- Hello.
Janet, who's that man? This is my new rebound boyfriend, Derek.
- I made him! - [laughs] Hi, I'm Derek.
You must be Mich oh.
Okay.
That makes more sense.
You must be Michael.
Janet's made a lot of talk-talk into my ear holes about you.
I know.
But I did, though.
Eleanor said that, to forget about Jason, I should create a rebound guy.
Hello, I'm Derek.
So I made one: Derek.
I'm her boyfriend, and she made me.
He's so nice.
[laughs] Whoa, look at this glass.
Look, this could be no, please put that down.
This could be very dangerous.
It shouldn't even be possible.
Well, maybe not 800 reboots ago, but apparently now it is.
- [gasps] - [laughs] Can you believe this? - Derek is it Derek? - It's Derek.
Derek, could you please give me and Janet a moment alone? Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.
Okay.
- No.
I'll miss you more.
Bye! [laughs] What a dork, am I right? [giggles]
Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay, I'll miss you like crazy.
- I'll miss you more.
No.
Janet, you can't just go around inventing people.
Get rid of him immediately.
No.
Eleanor told me to find a rebound guy.
I couldn't find one so I made one.
[laughs] He's helping me forget about Jason.
- [chime] - [groans] Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason.
Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, [whimpers] Jason, Jason, Jason - Honey - Jason, Jason, Jason Babe.
- [groans] We are going to spend every second together.
- [sighs] - No, no! No, you are not.
Janet, no one can know about I'm so sorry.
What is your name again? Derek Hoffstetler.
If anybody finds out about him, we are doomed.
He has to stay in your void.
It's our void now.
[laughs] - We moved in together! - What?! Can you believe it? I got my own hanger for my jumpsuit.
And we know literally everything.
We are so in sync, we're finishing each other's Derek! [dramatic movie music plays] - Hey, guys.
- [gasps] Michael, you frightened me.
Jason's making me watch this horror film about two ex-convicts who try to rob and murder a neglected a child.
Get over here.
Hey, I've got some great news.
I've arranged for you to have a weekend getaway.
I bet you're tired of being cooped up in this house, aren't you? I am a bit, actually.
Here you go.
I told Vicky that I'll be torturing you for the time being so just relax.
Live it up.
Out you go, here.
Now sadly, Janet is still offline so you can't call her, okay? The best news is none of this is suspicious.
I don't know what's going to happen to us, but I need to tell you something.
I love you.
What are you watching? Um, "Cannonball Run II.
But you can never watch it.
This copy's mine.
Uh-oh.
I guess I'm still pretty selfish.
Help! I need another ethics lesson, quick! Very weird energy coming off you right now.
Hey guys, whatcha doing? Nothing? Great.
So, Chidi, just wanted to double check.
How do ethical philosophers feel about murder? - It's frowned upon.
Um No, too hard to explain.
I'll show you.
Janet.
- Hi, there.
- Hey, there! Who the fork is that? Derek Hoffstetler, P.
I.
Derek is my rebound guy.
I made him.
- Janet - Thank you, Eleanor.
Thank you, Eleanor.
You know, you seem so sad.
Do you want me to make you a boyfriend too? - Ooh, I could have a brother? - Yes! Based on your last 10,000 comments, it would be Stone Cold Steve Austin's head on Tahani's body.
Or vice versa.
She's not going to make you anything.
- Janet, that will be all.
- Okay, goodbye.
I hope we same place again very now.
[chuckles] His brain is wrong.
[both laugh] - Mmm.
- Mm.
Now, the goal is to tap the ball hard enough that it goes through the wicket but not so hard that it goes too far through.
It combines both classic aspects of British sport: whimsy and restraint.
Oh, so restrained.
I believe it was Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who called croquet "barely a game.
Oh! Whoa, nice.
Mmm.
[glass shattering] [laughs] - Thor! - Well done.
Okay, here's where I am on this: We gotta to kill Derek.
No, think about it.
What if Vicky calls for Janet, and Derek shows up too? She's got to have a lot of questions that we can't answer.
But Derek does seem to be helping Janet get over Jason.
Right? No earthquakes since he showed up.
Girl, you are a messy bench who loves drama, - and I am into it.
- I'm sorry, Michael, but that's also ethically kind of dicey.
Here comes the egghead.
Well, look, Jason and Tahani are happy together, and telling them that he was once married to Janet might cause them harm.
It's not permissible to ruin their happiness to save ourselves.
Wait, but isn't keeping a secret from someone basically like lying though? No, no, it's okay to keep a secret as long as that secret isn't harming anyone, and telling them that secret might cause harm.
- Noice! - Cool.
Good point, egghead.
I know it's tempting to take a short-cut, but moral strength is defined by how we behave in times of stress.
Has anyone ever told you what a drag you are? Everyone.
Constantly.
[imitates a trumpet] I hereby pronounce you King Jason.
Dope.
Where did you learn how to do this? The Hertfordshire Academy for Expressionless Girls.
It was a finishing school I attended before Oxford, and then, of course, the Sorbonne.
Do you know what, I don't think I ever asked you were educated.
It wasn't a very good school.
For most of my classes, we just sold dirty magazines door-to-door.
You know, Jason, every single detail about your life is deeply disturbing.
And yet, I envy you.
I was never allowed to goof off.
Never even had a friend I could just be myself around.
Maybe I can be that friend.
Or your husband.
Will you marry me? I say we just let sleeping dogs lie.
Tell Janet that Derek can stay, but she's got to keep him under wraps so that none of the other demons find out.
Fine.
As long as they fly under the radar and Janet stays happy, I think we'll be safe.
- Janet.
- [both shouting] - How could you do this.
- You don't respect me, and you never have! Because to you I will always be that guy you made.
- Guys, what's going? - Okay, can we not do this in front of my friends? Oh, so they're your friends now.
I am out of here.
Oh, great, Derek.
I'm going to go back to our void, and I'm going to try to forget this ever happened.
It is not your void.
It is my void.
I know it's a boundless, barren nothingness, but you are always there.
Fine.
I'll go somewhere else.
Okay yeah We're forked here, aren't we? Look, Jason, you're lovely, and I've honestly had a wonderful time with you these past few weeks, but why on Earth would I marry you? Well, for one thing, we're not on Earth.
Decent point.
Also, we like each other, and I promise to always be nice to you.
Okay.
I'll marry you.
But I need some time to plan a proper reception.
I mean, where will everyone sit? Will it be Michael and Janet opposite Chidi and Eleanor or Michael and Eleanor opposite Janet and Chidi? Let's have it today at the beach.
The beach is where all the best stuff happens like swimsuit issues and "Saving Private Ryan" and "Jersey Shore" and - crabs! - Okay.
- Hi, there.
Is everything all right, Janet? Yeah, mm-hmm, everything is fine, it's okay, yeah.
I'm fine.
So, it's all fine.
[fake laughs] How can I help you? - [gasps] - There he is! Derek.
How are you? Nice to meet you.
Derek, get down from there.
I am not coming down because I meant to come here.
- Hi.
- Janet! Oh, my God, you're here, thank God.
Derek, I am not talking to you right now.
I'm here to announce that Jason Mendoza and Tahani Al-Jamil are getting married this evening.
"The ceremony will be private, "but we think it would be totally dope "if you biz-natches came and got turnt up with us afterward.
" I think I can guess who wrote the invitation.
How come you never get this upset at anything I do, Janet? Do not start with me right now, Derek.
Oh, I will start it.
Do not avoid me by going to the void.
- No, no! - No, no, no! - What a little bench! - [groans] Things are falling apart here.
Chidi I understand the ethics involved, but we need to stop that wedding.
We break up Jason and Tahani.
Janet stops being sad.
Derek goes away.
- Fine, but - [both groan] There is something called the Doctrine of Double Effect.
In order to remain ethical, you can't just go into this with the intention of killing Derek.
So, it's like ethically we should tell Jason that he used to be married to Janet, and it sure would be terrible if that ultimately led to Derek's death, wink.
No, the winking is bad.
You should not be winking or saying the word "wink.
" Okay.
We really need to kill We really need to kill any suspicion that I want to murder Derek.
Boom! - Wink.
- No.
Tahani, you're so smart.
That used to happen a lot at Lynyrd Skynyrd High School, but this time you won't be arrested.
Oh, I love you, Tahani.
[imitates gun shots] Pew! Pew! Jason I'd never guess we would be where we are today, me, a prominent British philanthropist with award-winning legs set to marry you, a swamp dweller who once asked me if the Presidents on Mount Rushmore have butts on the other side.
We don't make any sense together, and yet, when I'm with you, I can really let my hair down, metaphorically speaking of course, because I'd never have it up in the first place.
[chuckles] I'm not a factory worker.
But you've helped me to see that there is more to life than just appearances, and I can't believe I'm about to say this but - I think I love - Wait! Stop the ceremony! - This wedding cannot happen.
- This is not helpful, but I have always wanted to be a part of a wedding that was stopped dramatically.
We can't get married? Why not? Because Because Hang on a second.
I'm just thinking about all the rules I have to follow to stay ethical.
Someone else is going to have to do this.
- I can't, no - All right, all right.
I hate the be the bearer of bad news Uh, I think you mean "Bad News Bear.
" Before all the reboots, Jason was married to Janet.
Okay? That's why Janet's been glitching because she's sad 'cause she misses Jason, In fact, she was so sad she Well Derek.
Well, well, well.
Jason Mendoza.
No, no.
I'm Eleanor, man.
Everybody, this is Derek.
Janet made Derek as a boyfriend to try and rebound from Jason.
Oh, I feel quite light-headed.
Janet, fetch my tizzy couch please.
Decision time.
Any second now someone is going to realize we're all missing.
It probably won't happen again, and Chidi and I can forget anything we want to forget.
You know, just like, uh personal bloopers that were embarrassing or uh, days we were very gassy, et cetera.
And then, we'll meet back in your office.
You bring us up to speed, and we go from there.
No, no, no, we are not starting over.
We've come too far.
Our only options are to reboot either Janet or Derek.
Neither one is permissible as your primary intention.
[groans] Here we go with this whole "no genitals" thing again.
You're the one that gave me wind chimes instead of a penis, Janet.
This isn't about your wind-chime penis.
In fact, it's not about you at all.
I don't even know what it is about which is very confusing because the whole point of me is that I know everything! Janet, can I speak to you alone for a second? Okay, look, when you said you were sad about Jason and I suggested, "hey, find a rebound guy," it's 'cause I thought it was some sort of schoolgirl crush, like, just some guy you made out with a couple of times in the walk-in freezer of a Bruegger's Bagels.
- Not based on a real example.
- Yes, it is.
His name was Marcus Bitsburger.
I mean, you will feel better after some time goes by.
I don't really experience the passage of time.
I do use it as lotion occasionally.
I mean, weird, but keep doing it because your skin looks amazing.
Thank you.
Not skin.
The point is, to get through a real heartbreak, you kind of just have to sit with your feelings and mull it over and power through.
And you have to talk about it.
I don't know if I want to talk to Jason right now.
That's cool.
Until then If you ever need a friend to talk to Just know I'm here.
Derek.
There's no easy way to say this.
- I never should have made you.
- [chuckles] I think it's time for you to go away.
I understand because you understand.
I made you this morning.
We all remember.
- Okay, you ready to do this? - Yep.
Janet.
- What are you doing? - I imbued Derek with some of my thoughts and emotions.
This is the only way I can reabsorb them.
It will just be a minute.
Dang it.
Look away.
Everybody look away.
I'm going to keep watching, but you guys look away.
- [chuckles] - Goodbye, Derek.
Goodbye, mommy-girlfriend.
Bye, everybody.
Derek's going away now.
Does he seem a little bit uh still alive? Well, he's about as dead as he can be.
Are you worried you might start glitching again? No, I think I'll be okay now that I understand what I'm going through, and now that I know I can talk to my friends about it.
Okay, I'm going to toss this steamer trunk containing the lifeless husk of my ex-boyfriend into a remote corner of my limitless void.
- Bye, guys.
- Derek! [sighs] I'm kind of glad we didn't get married today.
Me too.
Perhaps we were rushing things a bit.
I mean, we don't even know that much about each other.
Like, who was the first person you kissed? The sexy mouse robot in the Chuck E.
I think that's probably enough getting to know each other for now.
We'll just take things slow.
I know I'm technically married to Janet, but I don't remember it at all.
I'm sorry that it puts you in a weird position, and I still like you a lot.
Me too.
What happens now? Don't know.
Do you want to try reabsorbing me? [laughs] - Is something wrong? - No.
Yep.
- What is it? The thing is, it's not even harming you, and if I tell you, I feel like it might harm you.
So, uh, ethically speaking, I don't think I have to tell you.
Yeah, well, forget all that.
This is freaking me out.
I'm losing my mind.
So just tell me.
And you don't need to respond because I know you have trouble saying how you feel I love you too.
I've never been that certain about anything.
I mean, I get how you said it.
I'm a total smokeshow.
But how did I say it so easily? Look, I don't want to talk about this, but after everything that's happened today, I think we gotta.
So, let's just get it all out there.
Um Well, yeah, I guess, do you I don't know do you have any feelings like that for me again, now? I'm sorry, but I don't think I do? Sorry? Why are you sorry? 'Cause I'm relieved, because I don't either.
So, all good.
I mean, I feel incredibly close to you No, no, no, no dude, dude you don't need to explain yourself.
We are on the same page, okay? Good.
Can I talk to Eleanor for a second? Actually, we're chatting about something right now.
No, it's cool.
We were wrapping it up.
Good talk, bro.
- What's on your mind? - Um, well being ethical it's hard, and I kind of hate it.
When's it get easier? Why don't you ask Chidi? He's the ethics master.
I'm just a newbie, and I still kind of suck at it.
Yeah, that's why I'm asking you.
Do you remember once when your change oil light came on? You just abandoned your car in a parking garage.
Of course.
But here, faced with the toughest challenges I could throw at you, you never once stopped trying to become a better person.
And I just Why? I don't know.
I mean, whenever I would do something crappy on Earth, there would be a little tiny voice in the back of my head that would say, "Eleanor, "don't grab that handful of olives from the salad bar.
You know, you didn't pay for that," or "Eleanor, don't spit those olive pits onto the floor of the grocery store.
That's not cool.
" Or "Eleanor, that old man just slipped on your olive pit, "and he fell down.
- This ethics stuff, it's hard, and it's confusing.
It is such a buzzkill.
But, it does get rid of the little voice.
Because at least I'm trying to do the right thing instead of the crappy thing, and I've got to say, man, I don't miss the little voice.
Well Thank you for helping me today.
Wow.
You really did just come here to chat, didn't you? Just shootin' the shirt with your old pal Eleanor.
I guess so, yeah, why? It's just a very human-y thing to do.
Hmm.
Hello, Michael.
Shut the door.
Have a seat.
[dramatic music swells]
I know you have trouble saying how you feel.
I love you too.
I've never been that certain about anything.
Thank you for helping me today.
You really did just come here to chat, didn't ya? It's just a very humany thing to do.
I really feel like things are starting to click in our little study group.
Hm.
Hello, Michael.
Shut the door.
Have a seat.
When you proposed this new form of torture, we all laughed behind your back.
What you've done here is truly amazing.
- Really? - Yes, these reports are remarkable.
Your humans are experiencing emotional torture at the same level of physical torture, created by our squiggliest eyeball corkscrews.
I'm jubilant.
As a result of our success, I'm getting a seat on the High Council.
We will greatly expand our neighborhood idea, and you will oversee the entire project.
You are being promoted.
[STIRRING MUSIC] Your Senior Staff pin.
No, this is everything I've ever wanted.
Oh! [CHUCKLES] This is everything I've ever wanted.
Oh, wow! You're really happy? Can't you tell? I'm basically squealing like a birthday girl.
At some point, we should finish discussing yesterday's events.
Do you mean us almost getting married and then finding out I was married to Janet and then Janet making a boyfriend to forget me and then Janet getting rid of that boyfriend? Or do you mean when we saw that cool cloud? The first bit.
Perhaps later after Michael briefs us on how we're gonna be fake-tortured today, we can just sit down and have a chat? Yes, good idea.
- Yo, Chidi.
- Yeah? You wanna hear about a cool cloud I saw? [PLAYFUL MUSIC] Come in.
[BOTH LAUGHING] That's right, nerds.
Everything around you, all you can see, is an elaborate system of torture designed just for you.
Sorry, we're in the Bad Place? Why are you revealing this now? Well, it was an experiment, and it worked, so my boss is promoting me.
Sorry, I should've introduced you.
This is my boss, Shawn.
Hello, imbeciles.
We need to study everything that happened here.
There was a first version that collapsed, but the second has been a huge success.
Your arms will be peeled like bananas.
- That part's just for fun - Right.
[LAUGHS] And then you will be, you know, tortured forever.
Michael, is this all true? Yes, Eleanor, it is.
You're such a rube, thinking you could become a better person.
You got Chidi to teach you stupid philosophy [CHUCKLES] Like those old farts were gonna provide guidance.
"Oh, Kierkegaard is so great.
Have you read 'Fear and Trembling'?" Well, I don't know, have you read "Boring and Stupid"? Because that's what you are.
How long will it take you to shut down the neighborhood? Better part of a day, I'd guess.
In the meantime, why don't we have a farewell party here tonight? You know, just to thank the crew for all the hard work.
We could jam to some tunes, you know, destroy the place, play beer pong with Jason's testicles.
- What do you say, boss? - Sure.
By the way, I know what you're thinking.
- "Maybe Janet can help.
" - Ah.
You're wrong.
[GIGGLES] - I hate you.
- Janet, what's wrong? Ooh! Where's my phone? We put a restraining bracelet on her, disrupting her powers.
[GIGGLES] It's made of mag-a-nets.
Mag-a-nets.
- Mag-a-ne-its.
- [CHUCKLES] Magnets are supposed to make me feel drunk, but guess what, I feel fine.
[GIGGLING] I can't believe Michael betrayed us again.
Why is it always the ones you most expect? We should've seen this coming.
" There's only one option.
Sean clearly doesn't know that Michael has rebooted this neighborhood 800 times.
I say we trade that information for some kind of reduced sentence.
Chidi, they're monsters.
Who's to say they won't agree to a deal, hear what we have to say, and turn around and install us into their horrible human zoo? There's no other option.
There's no way for a human to get that bracelet off of Janet.
But if there were, we could get her to call us a train to Mindy St.
Claire's house.
- I was gonna agree with you.
- Oh, great, well, that's two votes for my plan.
[SIGHS] Eleanor, what do you think? Trade information on Michael or try to escape to the Medium Place? Neither.
I vote we ignore everything Michael just said and blindly assume he's still on our side.
Who's with me? Sorry, but when all this started, you're the one who told us that Michael wasn't trustworthy.
Now you want us to trust him? Yes, for one very specific and rock-solid reason: - What's-his-name.
- Who? The dude, the super depressing religious guy.
The the real buzzkill whose name I can never remember.
Sedgwick? Oh, I love her.
Dear friend of mine.
Not important right now.
- Kierkegaard? - Yes, Kierkegaard.
When Michael was mocking us about trying to become better people, whose name did he use, huh? Kierkegaard.
I think he was sending us a message to take a leap of faith, 'cause that was Kierkegaard's thing, right? Yes, although it's probably better translated as a leap into faith.
It's so hard to be your friend.
Yep, sorry.
Dude was shook, talking about ethics and all spiraling about human stuff.
I think he's on our side.
Or maybe he's a supernatural demon designed to torture people, who just got offered his dream job, and has flipped on us like a ten-stone griddle chip.
It's a large pancake.
Come on, people, you can get these from context.
Look, maybe Michael jumped back to the dark side, but I don't think so.
I think he's gonna help us escape.
I know it sounds crazy, but if it weren't crazy, they wouldn't call it a leap of faith.
I think we gotta go to the cops.
What cops? Where do you think we are? [PLAYFUL MUSIC] Before tonight's party, I'd love to talk more about your strategy for torturing Tahani.
I'm impressed you were able to make her fall in love with Jason.
- She must be miserable.
- Yeah.
Humans make a lot of mistakes when they're horny.
Uh, boss, give me a second here.
- What the here, dude? - Vicky My hard work paid off for you, and now you're just taking all the credit.
Oh right.
And if that happens, we're all going down.
- [SIGHS] - So, spread the word.
No one talks about the reboots.
Fine, but you better make this right.
Mama want promotion, ya heard? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Hello, you dummies! - [LAUGHTER] This neighborhood was a labor of hate for many people here, so I thought that we should celebrate with an art form that we literally invented here in the Bad Place: the comedy roast! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I see Jason Mendoza's here.
Jason might not be the smartest guy in the world, but he is the dumbest guy in the world.
- [LAUGHTER] - Oh, Jason, buddy, all you had to do was to keep quiet, but you couldn't stop talking about Kendall Jenner or that dumb quarterback what was his name? Derek Bortles? Always ranting about Derek Bortles.
Don't take it personally.
He just has to put on a show for the other demons.
Tahani Al-Jamil, elegance, grace, sophistication, but enough about your sister.
[LAUGHTER] You know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was? When the last song played at one of her parties, and she would run off and cry because she still hadn't won her parents' approval.
You know the other worst moment of Tahani's life? Every other moment of her empty, pointless life! - [LAUGHTER] - Hey-oh! I see Eleanor Shellstrop is here.
Eleanor and I have a lot in common.
Now, here's how you can tell us apart: one of us is a manipulative demon who's an expert at making other people miserable, and then the other one is me! [LAUGHTER] You thought you deserved a Medium Place like Mindy St.
Claire? Are you kidding me? You're bad, Eleanor.
Oh, sorry, you want a joke? Okay, you love Chidi, and Chidi doesn't love you back.
- Boom! - [LAUGHTER] Now, that's funny, because it's very cruel and humiliating.
I consider you one of my closest friends - Not now, dude.
- "Speaking of Chidi" is something no one has ever said, because no one talks about Chidi, because no one likes Chidi, because he's so annoying about ethics.
Now, when you taught the Trolley Problem, did you secretly wish that it could be you who wound up under the trolley? Because all your students did.
- Whoo! - [LAUGHTER] Oh, Chidi, sorry, I got a joke for you, bud.
- Uh, knock knock.
- Who's there? You died alone, because you couldn't commit to anyone.
Let's tear this mother to the ground! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] So, maybe I was wrong, and Michael isn't on our side.
What up, pork sticks? That was "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd.
Coming up next, "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.
" - Idiots.
- [HORN BLARING] We're going streaking! [YELLS] [GROANS] The one time I think someone isn't lying to me, and it bites me in the ash.
I guess Michael really did flip back to the bad side.
Oh, does one think? That roast was the meanest thing I've ever seen, and I once saw a waiter bring Russell Crowe the wrong tea.
Well, we have no choice.
He pretended to be our friend.
He's gonna torture us for eternity.
And you know what the worst part is? He doesn't remember the name of my favorite football player.
Definitely not the worst part.
It is to me.
Blake Bortles is a cool name.
Derek Bortles is a dumb name.
[ELMO & PATSY'S "GRANDMA GOT RUN OVER BY A REINDEER"] Grandma got run over by a reindeer Walking home from our house Christmas Eve Hey, man, have you told Shawn how hugely important I was yet? I will get to it.
Enjoy yourself.
Rip a cat in half.
It's a party, Vicky, come on.
- Hey.
- Aah.
What does Michael keep whispering to you? Um, something, something, Vicky, something, something.
Uh, can I braid your hair? - No.
- Please? No, you know what, I'm good.
No, Shawn put them on her for a reason.
I'm not overruling the boss.
You're such a suck-up, Gayle.
- Can I braid your hair? - No get this I got it Ow, get your own bracelet, Victoria.
[GROANS] She [] hates me! Okay, you fat dinks, the sun is up, and we're about to close it down with one last song: "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd and "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" played at the same time.
[OVERLAPPING MUSIC PLAYING] Honestly, I'm still partial to the old-fashioned scorpion diapers, but you've done great work here.
I can't thank you enough for everything.
- Shawn, wait.
[ENGINE RUMBLING] It's Michael.
Michael's responsible for this neighborhood and everything that's happening right now.
- Bye! - I - Bad Janet? - What's cracking, nut-butts? Call us another train immediately.
Party's over.
[BRAKES SQUEAKING] How did they get Janet's bracelets off? It's literally impossible for a human to do.
It's like breathing underwater or driving without texting.
Shawn, I don't wanna make any accusations, but I accuse Vicky.
She asked me to help her take Janet's bracelets off.
She's jealous.
She's been trying to sabotage me the entire time.
What? No, he's lying.
Okay, I did try to get the bracelets off, - but I couldn't.
- Listen to yourself.
- You sound crazy.
- Normally I would love hearing a man tell a woman she's crazy, but I can't.
You aided the humans just to spite Michael.
Wait, this is trick.
Michael is the traitor.
I bet they're still here somehow.
This place stretches for 1,000 miles.
Fine.
Bad Janet? What? Scan the neighborhood, please.
[WHIRRING] No sign of any humans, but I actually did find something for Vicky.
What? - [EXAGGERATED FART] - [CHUCKLES] - [DERISIVE CHUCKLE] - Bad Janet, - great stuff as always.
We have to keep it all under wraps.
Get her on the train, and if anyone else says a single word of what happened here to anyone, you will be in a cocoon just like Vicky, and it is gooey in there.
How do we get the humans back from Mindy's? They've bought themselves some time, but we'll get them.
I'll start the extradition papers.
You stay here.
I want every trace of this neighborhood erased.
[SOLEMN MUSIC] [ELECTRICITY DRONING, ENGINE HUFFING] Oh, that was a bad idea! That was so scary so many different times.
I hated that.
You're my friends, and I want [WHIMPERS] I wanted to save you.
Hey, it's okay, bud.
This is the best summer ever, you guys.
[LAUGHTER] Oh.
Oh, Michael, we never doubted you for a moment.
Thank you, Tahani.
You're lying, though, right? Yes, I am.
I doubted you very strongly.
It's better translated as a leap into faith.
You remembered! [LAUGHS] Can somebody please explain what happened, and and can you guys just be a tiny bit quieter? Because, um, I've been drunk on magnets all day, and and I can literally hear every sound in the universe.
Basically, Michael sent us a code, and we had to crack it.
I figured out the first clue - No, you didn't, I did.
- I was there, though! - Ooh - Blake Bortles is a cool name.
Derek Bortles is a dumb name.
Yes Derek Bortles is indeed a very dumb name.
It's a clue.
- 'Cause he's the best.
- No, he's not, and even I know that.
Michael was telling us to use Derek, Janet's Derek, for something.
There were clues in the roast.
Everybody, quietly but quickly head to the train station, but let's split up, so we don't draw attention.
[CROWD HOLLERING] Ugh, you guys are the worst conspirators.
Okay, what else did Michael say in the roasts that might be meaningful? Tahani, do you remember? Well, he said my entire life was pointless and empty.
Yeah, but did he say anything we don't already know? Anything that stood out? You know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was? When the last song played at one of her parties, and she would run off and cry, because she still hadn't won her parents' approval.
Maybe Michael wanted us to wait until the end of the party, when everyone was at their most distracted.
And use Derek to drive the train, because he has some of Janet's powers.
- Janet! - Hi, hey, hey - Janet - Yeah? We need you to go get Derek from your void.
Okay.
Shoot, where's my void again? I forget.
Oh, yeah, it's everywhere.
Okay, hang on to your butt cheeks.
- [DING] - Ugh, where is he? - [ITEMS CLATTERING] - Ow, owie.
- Hm.
Derek, we need you to drive this train and take us to Mindy St.
Claire's house.
- Can you do that? - [CHUCKLES] Derek.
[ALL EXHALE ECSTATICALLY] Wait nobody get on that train.
- Derek? - Why not? Because of what Michael said to me.
You thought you deserved a Medium Place? You're bad, Eleanor.
This is exactly the place you should be.
I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Pippa Middleton right before we went paragliding in Gibraltar.
"Let's go.
" - What? That's what I said.
- Guys, leap of faith.
Michael said we shouldn't get on that train.
Any minute now, those demons are gonna come looking for us.
Where are we supposed to hide? [GASPS] Oh, no.
Now, when you taught the Trolley Problem, did you secretly wish that it could be you who wound up under the trolley? Because all your students did.
You're gonna wait until the last song of the night - Derek.
- And when you do leave, you're gonna be flying a solo mission.
Oh maximum Derek.
Derek headed off, and when the new train arrived, the four of us crawled underneath before any of the drunk demons saw us.
That kept us from being detected when Bad Janet scanned the neighborhood.
We fooled those mofos like the chumps they are.
We got all four clues you left us.
Oh, that's great.
It was pretty easy.
I just kept whispering things into Janet's ear to make her paranoid.
I'm sorry, wh-what did you whisper to me? I don't remember.
[CROWD CHEERING] Something, something, Vicky, something, something.
What does Michael keep whispering to you? Something, something, Vicky, something, something.
- Uh - And that made her try to take Janet's bracelets off, which framed her for the escape.
- You.
- Oh Guys, I-I want to apologize for roasting you earlier.
Tahani's stuff was perfect I mean, no.
Guys, let's just take a moment here.
They're gone, which means that we won and might actually get a chance to go to the real Good Place.
This is everything we ever wanted.
Speaking of people getting what they want, I really hope Mindy liked the present we sent her.
[KNOCKING] - Who are you? - Derek.
"Thanks for helping us all those times we showed up.
"To repay you, here's a willing sex robot and two duffel bags full of cocaine.
- All right!
Okay.
I don't know about you guys, but I say we leave this miserable shirthole.
Now wait.
Wait.
Not so fast.
Now getting to the Good Place is pretty tricky.
There's no train to catch.
I call right nipple! That's shotgun on Optimus Prime.
Look.
This vehicle, which is decidedly not Optimus Prime - Aw! - Has never been built before.
So I'm gonna need a few days to do this.
Dude, we just escaped by the skin of our teeth.
And any second now, Shawn is gonna realize that we are not at Mindy St.
Clair's.
So whatever this magical Good Place-mobile is, now's the time to whip it out, B.
Michael, they're right.
We gotta go.
[SCREEN BEEPING] Oh [MUMBLES] Okay.
Here goes nothing.
Janet, if you would.
And presto! Oops.
Forgot to log in first.
Gotta answer my security question.
- We did it, guys.
We won.
We're going to The Good Place in a fricking gold balloon.
- Shotgun! - It's a hot air balloon.
What does that even mean? Top of the balloon.
Ultimate shotgun.
[MELLOW MUSIC] So many memories of this place.
Eating frozen yogurt, and then having diarrhea, and then eating more frozen yogurt, and then more diarrhea.
We're about to be on a balloon, man.
What do you think our new home will be like? I'm picturing Hawaiian beach, unlimited mai tais, and a phone.
Ugh, I miss my phone so much.
I bet I have so many texts.
I just want us all to be together.
Separate houses, obviously.
Large lawns.
I'd have a tasteful moat.
All of my philosophy heroes walking around, waiting to be engaged in rigorous intellectual debate, and I hope that library is air-conditioned, because we are going to be working up quite a sweat.
Oh! And soul mates! I hope they're real.
I mean, you know for all of us.
I hope everyone gets someone special.
Good news! We've got a handle on the controls.
Who's ready to go balloonin'? Okay, I think we figured it out.
[SCREEN BEEPS] I pieced together this design from a number of ancient manuscripts, which Janet will now interpret for you.
The balloon will only transport those who have attained self-realization.
If not, passage will be denied.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
We got this.
I don't know about you guys, but I am definitely the best version of myself.
I know a shirt-ton about ethics now, 'cause I studied.
And I read books that weren't even written by the Real Housewives.
[TENSE MUSIC] - [SCALE CHIMES] - Oh! Oh, man.
I didn't believe anything I was saying.
I just whoo! In I go.
[SCALE CHIMES] Well, I mean - [SCALE CHIMES] - Oh dip! - [SCALE TOOTS] - Aw, nuts! It's okay! The pattern is green, green, green, red.
Remember that when it starts up again.
I'm sorry, everyone.
I just have some worries as well as some concerns that could potentially turn into outright fears.
Wow, there they go.
Come with us, Dr.
Freakout.
That was a joke.
We are actually very good friends.
Okay, here's the thing.
That balloon wants us to be the best version of ourselves.
But for the four of us, that's not just a metaphor.
There have literally been 802 different versions of us.
And what version of Chidi is even real? What happens here? Does he eventually tire himself out? Usually, but this one seems to be getting stronger as he goes on.
And this Chidi is an imposter! Okay.
This is pretty simple, bud.
You've been our teacher this whole time.
And we are much better because of you.
If we're the best versions of ourselves, which that balloon just proved, then you definitely are.
So in a way, it doesn't matter if I was better in version 492 or whatever, because the best version of me is just as much about my effect on the world around me as it is about my own egocentric self-image.
I really meant that much to you guys? Of course you did.
All right.
- [SCALE CHIMES] - Yeah! Yeah! - [SCALE CHIMES] - Yeah.
- [SCALE CHIMES] - Dope! - [SCALE TOOTS] - Oh! Chidi got in my head.
It's just that thing Chidi said about previous versions of myself.
It's screwing me up.
But I can fix it.
I stole this from your house the first night we were here.
Okay.
Be cool.
Guys, we're just not ready.
I think we should regroup and try again tomorrow.
Hang on.
I know the answer.
I know why I'm not my best self.
Do you remember that version of me from the tape of us at Mindy's? Where I was vulnerable and emotional and honest? That Eleanor is a better Eleanor than this one.
And that is not an easy thing for me to say, "You're not better than me" was my yearbook quote.
You had a pet lizard which I made poop on you all the time.
No, can you tell us more about Chidi's and my relationship from that version? Right.
Sorry.
Well, you got really into ethics, and you spent a lot of time together.
Once you handed him a tissue right before he sneezed, and that simple act of anticipating his needs made him fall for you.
One night you took a walk along the lake, and you had your first kiss, which: Gross.
Kissing is gross.
You just mash your food holes together.
Look, there are obviously some undealt-with issues here.
I propose that everyone who was green go ahead and board the magic balloon, and set out to the Good Place.
Sort of like an advance team.
We'll put our names in or book a table.
However it works.
And then we'll send back the magical balloon for the red light people later on.
It's a perfect plan.
[SCALE TOOTS] No! It's not working! It probably thinks I'm Eleanor.
I'm not sure that's true, Janet.
You still haven't talked to Jason about your romantic baggage, and the three of you are in some sort of weird love triangle.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Also, love isn't a triangle.
It's a five dimensional blob, so Okay.
If you're so perfect, step on the scale.
Fine.
[SCALE TOOTS AND POPS] Ooh, I think I broke it.
Oh man.
This stinks.
I'm having this feeling where what is it called? You know, where you you did a thing and you're sad after it? After-sad? Is that no.
You humans have so many emotions! You only need two: Anger and confusion! Michael, what's going on? The problem isn't any of you.
This whole balloon thing is a fake.
The truth is, I have no idea how to get into the Good Place and I never have! Well, Michael's right.
I'm angry and confused.
So months ago, when you said you had this whole complicated plan for getting us to the Good Place It was a lie.
Not an exaggeration! I actually tried one billion and twelve different plans.
But the only way into the Good Place is by being a good person on Earth.
This is unforgivable.
How many times can you betray us? I'm sorry.
I really am, because while I was searching for a way to get in, I was also taking your ethics classes, learning why it was bad to lie.
So not only did I fail at getting us into the Good Place, I also learned the error of my ways.
Real rock bottom for a demon, I'll tell you.
But this was not torture.
So what happens now? Shawn will eventually figure out you're not at Mindy's, and he'll realize that someone on the inside was helping you.
So you'll go to the real Bad Place forever, and I will be be retired.
You're you're mad at me.
I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.
Oh, come on.
Everyone knows that's worse.
So this really is the end.
Ignore our problems, and drink heavily.
Janet! A million bottles of your finest booze, please! [AL GREEN'S "I WISH YOU WERE HERE" PLAYING] - You all right? - Kind of.
I asked Michael if I could pop the giant balloon, and he said no.
Then I asked if I could suck the helium out of it to make my voice sound funny so it cheers everyone up, and he just kind of sighed and walked away.
So I guess that one is still on the table.
Are you and me cool? Not exactly.
I think perhaps given everything, it's best we end our relationship.
It's probably about time I stopped relying on others for my sense of self-worth or happiness.
There was no one who could fix this for me except me.
My mom was a manager at a pet store.
Does that help? No, and please don't launch into one of your long stories - She got fired after I - Please, no.
Robbed the pet store where she worked.
- Please, please, Jason.
- We actually - robbed it together.
- No, no, no.
Long story short, it was all a dream.
- Feelings are stupid.
- Yeah.
Who needs 'em? But, uh, in case feelings aren't stupid, and in the case that we are eternally doomed, I thought it might be worth mentioning that I do Have feelings for you.
And I know you don't feel the same way.
And although that fills me with anger and confusion Wow.
Michael was right on the money.
I just wanted you to know the truth.
You are I mean Oh, no.
I want to.
I want to.
Here's the thing about me.
You know the sound that a fork makes in the garbage disposal? That's the sound that my brain makes all the time.
It's just this constant grinding about things I'm afraid of or things that I want or want to want or want to want to Is it grinding in there right now, bud? Yep, but the point is the circumstances under which me met are completely insane.
And that just makes the grinding harder.
I just wish we met the way normal people meet.
Like at a philosophy conference, or after one of my philosophy lectures.
You're such a nerd.
[CLINKING GLASS] Attention, everyone.
We may not know exactly which version of ourselves was technically our best self, but you know what? I like who we are right now.
To this version of us.
To the good people we've all become.
Oh, and to Eleanor, our unofficial leader.
You pack a lot of heart and grit into that diminutive frame.
Like a scrappy little auto mechanic.
- And to Janet, the best robot.
- Not a robot.
- Girl.
- Not a girl.
- And straight up hottie.
- I am attractive, yes.
Any of us could have ever asked for.
Thanks, guys.
She's not gonna give a speech.
Okay.
Cool.
Ooh! One more toast.
To Michael! - Michael! - Whoo-whoo! Hoo-hoo! Who is easily the best version of himself.
Granted, the bar was low.
He is a demon.
But he made a mistake and admitted he was wrong, which makes him better than 90% of all humans.
I mean, look at us.
A self-obsessed socialite, a ridiculous giraffe, an absurd British aristocrat, a narcissistic attention seeker.
- Are these all me? - Yes.
I was gonna do eight for you, and one for everyone else.
The point is Michael, we forgive you.
I mean, at least you tried to find a way to the Good Place.
And that's the greatest thing someone can do, just try your best.
So we hereby name you an honorary human.
Oh, and look at this.
A stress ball with a dumb corporate logo.
Oh, I can't wait to keep finding this and then almost throw it away, and then think, "No, I'll use it.
" [LAUGHTER] Oh, guys.
A Dr.
Oz diet book because you're all such suckers.
This is all garbage that I have no real use for.
That's right.
- Of course you don't! - That's mean! That was version one! [LAUGHING] [SCREEN CHIMES] Michael, there's a message coming in from Shawn.
"Finish shutting everything down.
"Sending train first thing tomorrow.
"Humans will be captured and tortured soup.
"Sorry.
Autocorrect.
Soon.
"Although weirdly, "I did just finish turning someone into soup.
Bye.
" [SCREEN CHIMES] What do you guys think the Bad Place is going to be for you? I'll probably go to a Skrillex concert.
And I'll be waiting for the bass drop, and it it'll never come.
For me it'll be camping.
Like, I'll just always be camping.
I'm pretty good at turning every place I go into my personal hell, so I think they'll have a lot of options for me.
Mine will obviously be an eternity spent in the Swiss Alps.
That sounds amazing.
Yeah.
Still fine.
You'd be fine.
Who are we kidding? You'll probably be running the place in like a week.
She'll be like, "Oh, hibbledy-dibbledy, This simply won't do.
I demand to speak to your manager.
" - Again! Again! - "Your manager.
" [LAUGHTER] Of course! That's it.
I thought about that.
It's a non-starter.
Judge rarely hears cases.
And the only way to get to the Judge's office is through a portal, and we can never get to that.
Why not? We'd have to walk through the actual Bad Place, in plain sight, without getting caught.
Reach and pass through the portal, Convince the judge to hear us out, even though we didn't go through the proper channels.
And then somehow win our unwinnable case.
[BURPS] Okay.
Get rest tonight.
First thing tomorrow, we're going to the Bad Place.
We had a lot of good times together.
I'll see you in the next life.
Good-bye, clowns.
Goodbye, modernist architecture that I was too trashy to appreciate.
Good-bye, house.
Good-bye, house.
And there is no overhead storage, so if you have any bags, why don't you just go ahead and place them up your fat butts? Sorry about this, Bad Janet.
Sorry about what, you fat dink? This was your life's work.
Are you okay with leaving the fake Good Place behind? As long as I'm with you guys, I'm always in the fake Good Place.
That doesn't sound as nice as you think it does.
The real Bad Place was the friends we made along the way.
Nope.
Still nonsense.
One more try.
- [LAUGHS] I just made an aphorism.
Hit it, Janet! Next stop, the actual Bad Place! [WHIRRING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC]
 [TRAIN RUMBLES] You all right there, chief? You look like you lost your lucky bookmark or something.
Oh, no.
Did I? It's fine.
Got it right here.
It's just that now that we're actually on the train, heading to Bad Place Headquarters, this plan is starting to feel slightly completely insane.
This is the only way to get to the Judge? I'm afraid so.
The only things there are the Judge's quarters, the accounting department, and the Janet warehouse.
There's also an IHOP.
Oh! I'm gonna order the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity! No.
Sorry.
In this realm, IHOP stands for "Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes.
" You don't really eat these pancakes.
It's more like they eat you.
Okay.
And the only way through the portal is with one of these.
What is that? Is that jewelry? Not that it matters.
It's just some jewelry I don't have.
- Can I have it? - These pins are very hard to come by.
Only upper management types have them.
So you guys will lay low while I get us four more.
Janet doesn't need one, because for portals, she counts as a carry-on.
I'm luggage.
So the chances of you being recognized are very small.
I don't know.
This plan seems complicated.
To be fair, you also once said that about an orange.
They don't make sense.
Apples, you eat their clothes.
But oranges you don't? Forget this plan! I say we just huck a Molotov cocktail and [WHOOSHES] run through the portal.
I think we should go with Michael's plan.
He makes a strong case.
Okay, now, you're all going to need aliases.
Cool.
I'm gonna be Diana Tremaine.
That was the name on my fake ID in high school.
Her address was 123 Whatever Street, Canada City, Canada.
Arizona bouncers are the best.
Character work! Such fun.
Ooh, I shall be Rhonda Mumps.
And I work down at the hot dog factory.
You need to be more specific.
There are nine hot dog torture departments.
Making people into, stuffing people with Ooh, stuffing people sounds fun.
Is that like shoving them into the throats of vegans? Yes.
Throats.
I know what my secret identity is.
Then I'll be Jake - Don't say Jortles.
Jortles! And I work in the Molotov cocktail department.
Boy, you know, I thought you guys would be more worried about this.
We've been knee-deep in demons for, like, 800 reboots now.
Lying about who we are is second nature.
Chidi? I hate this.
I hate lying.
It's not permissible.
Jeez Louise! Looks like Chidi has a real case of the Mondays, am I right? Hey, pass the NASCAR ketchup.
Hey, buddy.
Look if you don't want to lie because it conflicts with your moral principles, I get it.
No one's gonna be mad at you.
- Really? - No, dumbass! I'm lying to you to make you feel better.
See? Sometimes lying is awesome.
[GASPS] Plus I said dumbass.
Oh, cursing.
What if I lie down here and I lose 12 points, and then we get in front of the Judge, and I'm 12 points short? Or what if the Judge won't even take our case at all because we lied to get there? Kant says that lying is always wrong, and I follow that maxim.
So you can't even lie to demons? They're trying to torture us, man.
We're behind enemy lines! Well, principles aren't principles when you pick and choose when you're going to follow them.
I won't lie about who I am.
Okay.
I understand, and I'm cool with it.
You're lying right now, aren't you? Yes.
I want to strangle you.
I think you look nice.
I think you look sexy.
Here, I got you this to help your disguise.
Whoa, a briefcase? Take my credit card to the hedge fund.
I'll meet you at the martini store.
Oh, you're gonna get caught.
Give me the briefcase back.
- Thanks.
Now I know you look like a Bad Janet, but can you act like one? I have gained a lot of new skills recently.
For example, I learned how to be passive-aggressive.
Totally fine that you guys haven't noticed.
- Oh! - Let's practice.
I'm going to make a simple request, and you're going to give me that patented Bad Janet attitude.
Can I have a glass of water? Here you go! Nope.
Let's try again.
Be mean.
Janet, what's that behind your back? - Nothing.
- Give it to me.
It's a glass of water.
And a back-up glass.
Oh, boy.
It's okay.
We'll keep working.
We're here.
Keep walking.
Keep your heads down.
- And you are ugly.
- Just act unnatural.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, you wait here, while I go get us some more of these pins.
But what is this place? It's just a place.
You know.
- The Museum of Human Misery? Oh, yeah.
Okay.
It's a torture museum.
Famous examples of bad behavior, and explanations of the torture they earned.
Is there a gift shop? Jason, this is Hell.
Of course there's a gift shop.
It's the least horrifying room.
It's the Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness.
This was the safest place I could think of.
No one ever comes in here.
Guys, if you do leave this room, you're gonna see things that will haunt you for eternity.
Okay.
Back soon.
Bye! Hey! Hey! Be careful, okay? Be careful? Yeah.
Oh.
Eleanor, are you worried about me? Yeah.
Don't go getting all goopy on me.
Worry about them.
I'll be fine.
Okay.
[CHUCKLES] "First man to send an unsolicited picture of his genitals.
" [MANNEQUIN WHIRRING] [ROBOTIC CACKLING] "First waiter to approach a diner with an empty plate and sarcastically say, 'I guess you hated it.
'" "First white person to grow dreadlocks.
" And "First person to call Ultimate Frisbee 'Ultimate.
Why don't you set up the bar over by that wall? Why don't you roll off your mom and do it yourself, you fat dink? [BOTH LAUGHING] Set up more of those tables.
We're expecting a big crowd.
You got it, you piece of butt.
Son of a bitch! Still happy I can swear now, but everything else about this is very bad! [TYPEWRITERS CLICKING, INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, boss.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
Axe up.
Oh! New scent! "Transformers!" Yes.
- Really zips my tip.
- Yeah.
Anyway I drew up some extradition papers to get them back from Mindy's.
I think I'll take a few of my most trusted staff, hop in the portal, file those with the Judge, quick stop for pancakes, and then I'll head on back.
By the way, I'm gonna need four pins for my crew.
This is very thorough.
However Is that where we're putting top priority files nowadays? We won't need extradition papers.
Plans are already in motion to get the humans back in a different way.
This is not good.
This is not good! All right.
Well, we can't just stand here in a group.
It looks too conspicuous.
I'll go with Tahani.
Chidi, go with Jason.
That way, Jason's unearned confidence lets him do all the talking, and you don't have to lie.
Okay? Come on, Diana, let's hit the bar.
- Thank you.
Hors d'oeuvre? Oh, what do you got? Soul food from Maine, bagels from Arkansas, Hawaiian pizza of course, and egg salad from a hospital vending machine in Azerbaijan.
Have a terrible evening.
No way! Trent, is that you? Who else could it be? Come on, dab it out.
Boom boom! 'Sup? I'm Chet.
Jake is my name, Molotov cocktail is my game.
I think school is lame, I got a tattoo of David Blaine.
- What? - Ooh! Tight! Ball tap! Oh, dude.
When'd you leave decap? 800 years ago? Something like that.
I just joined a new department.
Toxic Masculinity.
We torture internet trolls, frat dudes.
Actually started as a training program to prep for when the "Girls Gone Wild" dude gets here.
- Joe Francis.
- The one.
Legend! Bro-hams! Get over here and meet my top dog Trent.
My top dog Dirk here, he got stuck with a new case.
He can't crack it.
Hit them with it, D-Money.
So I'm trying to torture this guy, right? Brant? Brant was a total lord.
He got kicked off of Rob Gronkowski's party cruise for throwing a lobster at a stripper.
And then he died doing a keg stand in the back of a moving Jeep Wrangler.
Anyways, we run a couple hundred torture scenarios.
None of them seem quite right, you know? Think we can get you to crack this nut? Well, I mean, how could I say no? We all know how I would say no.
You're always so weird.
Love that about you.
Don't get me wrong, I love shoving hot dogs into people, but once you've dogged every hole, you just start to feel like you're repeating yourself.
I hear that, sister.
I'm gonna go take a dump.
- You want me to grab you one? - No, I'm good.
Thanks.
- Not even a little nug? - Nah, I'm a'ight.
Well, hang out with Johnny Depp long enough, and you become pretty good at lying.
Like, "No, you're whole thing isn't exhausting at all.
" Hi there, you big stinky poop face guys.
Ugh.
It's me, Good Janet.
I'm sorry I called you big stinky poop face guys.
That's okay.
Janet, can you dig around a little bit and find out what this event is and how long it's gonna last? I'd love to punch your teeth.
Teeth.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] What's all this? Well, I was going to try to get the humans back by going through the proper channels, but then I remembered, I'm a naughty bitch.
So I sent a black ops team to Mindy's to extract them.
Nobody from the Bad Place is allowed in Mindy's neighborhood.
You can't do that, Shawn.
It's illegal! Oh, no.
Guys, Michael says this is illegal.
I hadn't thought of that.
Listen.
Your experiment blew up in our faces.
The example I made out of Vicky ensured that everybody from the neighborhood has kept their mouths shut.
But we're not out of the woods until those four are back in custody.
So I rounded up some loyal friends and took matters into my own hands.
Relax, Mike.
This will all be over soon, and we can all head down to the Museum.
- The Museum? - Yes.
I took the form of a 45-year-old white man for a reason.
I can only fail up.
[BUZZER SOUNDS] The team is in place.
Let's do this.
Hey.
Hi.
So, um, those bro demons over there think I'm some kind of great torturer.
And they want my advice on how to torture someone.
Help me! You know the answer, dude.
Lie your ass off.
If Rhonda can do it, you can.
You know once I shoved a hot dog right down the throat of the legendary John Wayne.
She even name drops in Hell.
No! I told you lies have consequences! I will have contributed to someone's eternal torture because I disobeyed a basic Kantian moral principle! I'm gonna be sick, and I don't want to go back to the bathroom because they put mirrors in the toilet, and that makes you really confront what you're doing! Okay.
Okay.
Sit down.
Hear me out.
What if lying is ethical in this situation? What if certain actions aren't universally good or bad? - Like Jonathan Dancy says.
- Jonathan Dancy? Are you talking about moral particularism? We never even covered that.
You read on your own? You think just because I'm a straight hottie I can't read philosophy for fun? Look.
Moral particularism says there are no fixed rules that work in every situation.
Like, let's say you promised your friend you'd go to the movies.
But then your mom suddenly gets rushed to the ER.
Your boy Kant would say never break a promise.
- Real example? - Yep! But a moral particularist like me I'm one now; I just decided would say there's no absolute rule.
You have to choose your actions based on the particular situation and right now, we are in a pretty bonkers situation.
I don't think I can change what I believe just like that! And I didn't think I would ever be at a cocktail party in literal Hell, lecturing my teacher/ex-lover about moral particularism, but life throws you curveballs, bro! And need I remind you it was doing things your way that made you end up here.
Man, get back over there, dog.
Damn, you got that good stank.
Thanks.
Right back at you, bud.
Smash you later.
Butt ass.
How long is this stupid event supposed to last, anyway? They're unveiling the exhibit in ten minutes, then everyone will get drunk and poke each other with hot sticks, and then it'll be over.
Farts.
Uh-oh.
Bad Janet, walkie-talkie mode.
Now entering Mindy St.
Claire's house.
This is so exciting! I hope everyone gets hurt! Living room's clear.
Oh, God! This feels so weird! Here we go! Oh, do some coke off my butt.
Wait! What whoa, whoa, whoa! Who are you guys? Oh, friends! Hi, I'm Derek! Where are the humans? And who is Derek? Me is Derek.
These are my wind chimes.
- [WIND CHIMES CHIMING] - Uh-oh! My wind chimes like you.
The only people here are Mindy St.
Claire and an unknown male with a genital deformity.
The four humans are not here.
Where is Michael? Oh, boy! Oh, boy! - Hey there, Mike! - Hey, Lance.
Listen up, people.
We need to find Michael, and we need to be discreet.
You, search from the spastic dentistry department down through disembowelment.
You, cover children's dance recitals through holiday weekend IKEA.
Go.
Hey, hey! Found him! Just bird-dogging some tail.
What you got for me, Trent? Well, peep this, dog.
You really want to torture this dirtbag? You give him books.
And then I realized she hated books, so I just gave her mad books to read, round the clock.
Books like exploded? No, no, no.
They were just you know regular moral philosophy books.
You know everyone hates moral philosophers.
That is true.
And I know it's wild, but you know sometimes you gotta think outside the bun.
- Ah! Sick Taco Bell ref.
- Very nice.
This guy's the best, really? Yeah, maybe I don't know what I'm talking ball tap! - Oh! - Oh! Ohh! That's what you get for questioning Trent, the torture master! He got you so bad! Yeah, he did.
He did.
Nice job, bro.
All right, you've convinced me.
I'll give him books.
Hey, you two.
Get your ugly necks over here.
Guys, I found something very bad.
Gather 'round.
Gather 'round.
This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
- What do we do? - Just don't draw attention.
Whatever this is, it'll be over in a second, and we can sneak out the door.
Feast your eyes on the newest exhibit here at the Museum of Human Misery! The residents of neighborhood 12358W! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Oh no! Is that what they think my hair looks like? This game-changing experiment chose four humans and had them torture each other.
It's already led to major breakthroughs in the future of our industry.
Now, obviously, we couldn't get the actual four idiots as they're off being tortured, so we cooked up the next best thing.
It's remarkable.
It's remarkable! [LAUGHTER] I'm Chidi Anagonye, or maybe I'm not.
I can't decide anything.
Or maybe I can.
Aww.
I can't decide.
My stomach hurts.
[LAUGHTER] What? They kind of nailed it.
I mock others to distract myself from the emptiness inside me.
That's fair.
That's a fair hit.
I'm Jason Mendoza.
Duh That's me.
Hey.
Where have you been? Oh, how do you smell loud and confusing? No time to explain.
We gotta go.
All right, let's just back up here.
- What do we do? - This! Jortles! Go! Hey, Eleanor.
Thanks for the advice.
It was really helpful, even though I had to say a lot of words I don't like, like douche, and chick, and peep this Okay, great! No problem, I'm just kind of focused - on running right now.
- Right, sorry! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Here.
Put the pins on your lapels.
Okay, okay.
You didn't give me a pin, man.
Hang on.
Hang on! - Wait.
Where's Janet? No time to wait for her.
You three go now.
Now! [PORTAL WHOOSHES] [PORTAL WHOOSHES] - Portals! - [PORTAL WHOOSHES] - Any day now, man.
- Hey! Hey, guess what? I just solved the trolley problem.
Remember? The thought experiment where you're driving the trolley, and you can either plow into a group of people or turn and hit one person? I solved it.
That's really great.
And the actual solution is very simple.
- Sacrifice yourself.
- What does that mean? You look after the others.
- They need you.
- No.
Step away from the portal! - Good-bye, Eleanor.
- No, no.
Wait, wait! Hey, boss.
I think I barfed in another dimension before we landed.
Is my barf just gonna float out there forever? Is someone gonna fly through my barf when they use the portal? Ugh, stop saying barf.
And where's Michael? He's not coming.
He sacrificed himself to save me.
The last thing I saw was Shawn grabbing him.
Was it a nice grab or a bad grab? A bad grab.
Like, a nice bad grab, or a mean bad grab? No Michael and no Janet.
Didn't even get to say a proper goodbye.
We have to handle this ourselves.
Michael said the portal would lead us to the Judge, so where's the Judge? All I see is a burrito.
Do you think it's a test? Like, maybe one of us is supposed to eat it, or we eat it together, or or maybe, maybe it's a test to see how long we can go without eating it.
I'm not scared of any burrito.
I'll eat it.
Unless The burrito is the Judge.
Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
Judges aren't food, judges are serious people who wear long, silk nightgowns and big, white powdered wigs.
- What? - Really? I don't know, I'm just saying we've certainly seen weirder things than an all-knowing burrito.
We can't take any chances.
Hello, Your Excellency.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
We doth seek thine judgment.
We've traveled a long distance to see you, o great one.
What are you guys looking at? [ALL SCREAMING] Hi.
I'm the Judge.
The paperwork should've shown up by now.
Unless you guys just, like, came here.
Wait, did you guys just come here? [GASP] Oh, my God.
You guys are bad.
Which one is the worst one of you? Is it you, glasses? Oh, I bet it's you.
Okay, yeah, well, we did just sort of "show up," but we had to.
We were escaping the Bad Place, which now that I think about it, there might be some demons following us.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Get comfortable.
[DING] [GASP] A classic Saint Crispin's Day garden party frock.
Wait, is it after 4:00 p.
m.
? - Not important.
- Let's have a look at your files.
Wait, you don't already know everything about us? You're not omniscient? Well Not in the way you mean.
I try to learn as little as I can about the events of humankind so I can remain impartial, 'cause I'm a judge.
I've been binging Ken Burns's "Vietnam" recently.
It's okay.
I mean, I'm immortal, but that thing is long.
[CHUCKLING] You know what I'm saying.
Anyway, your petition is denied.
I can't hear your case.
Please exit to the rear.
[PORTAL WHOOSHING] What? I just absorbed the entirety of your existences, and I just wanna say you guys are so cute.
You frankly wouldn't believe what we've been through just to be here today.
I mean, I would, because I just learned everything about you, but keep talking.
I am, like, obsessed with your accent.
We have made so much progress and all we ask is an audience with you to prove it.
Is that not your very purpose to weigh in on matters such as ours? To paraphrase a song written by my godfather hey, judge.
Don't make it bad.
Take a sad group and make us better.
Say aluminum.
I mean, it takes a lot of guts to just show up here unannounced.
Plus, I haven't had a case in, like, 30 years and I'm super bored.
So, it's either this or start "Bloodline," and I don't know, I just don't feel like I can see Kyle Chandler as anyone else but Coach Taylor.
So, the case? Right.
Let's do it.
[RELIEVED SIGHS] You had one job torture four bad people forever.
Not only did you fail, you're a traitor.
You really junked your jeans on this one, you butterface.
You got that right, sister.
And this is how you repay me.
Oh, spare me the sanctimonious lecture.
You never cared about me.
In the words of one of my actual friends Ya basic.
It's a human insult.
It's devastating.
You're devastated right now.
Oh, you mean this Good Janet? I found her in, like, two seconds.
She was wandering the halls being polite to people, like a chump.
So, I marble-ized her.
Keep her if you want.
Maybe shove it up your wiener for safekeeping? I don't know, it's up to you.
I'm going to give each of you a test to see how much progress you've made.
And if I deem you fit to be in the Good Place, then zrrrup.
Up you go.
- Great.
Can we be tested together as a group? Yeah, we all need to be able to cheat off Chidi.
Oh, that's why your name is Chidi.
I get it now.
I'm sorry, cuties, the tests have to be individual.
Well, can we be graded as a group then? The only reason we've come this far is because we've helped each other.
And I don't think anything's gonna feel like the Good Place if we're not together.
So, if you all pass, you're in.
You are very lucky that I cannot send you to the Bad Idea place, because that one is a stanker.
But whatever blows your dress up, am I right? [CLICKS TONGUE] - Jason.
- Present! Good.
In front of you is a video game system loaded with Madden football.
Are you kidding me? I'm the best at Madden.
I call Jaguars.
As I was about to tell you, you can only play against the Jaguars.
- No.
I'm gonna win.
Say no more, scary judge lady.
Tell my friends their souls are in good hands.
No, I fumbled the kickoff! Titans suck.
Tahani it's such a pretty name.
My name is super boring Jen.
It's just short for hydrogen, which was the only thing that was in existence at the time that I was born.
Anywho.
Oh, also everyone in every room that you pass is going to be discussing what they truly think about you.
Okay, have fun.
[GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] [GASPS] I see.
It's a test of my ability to not care what people think of me.
[GASP] Oh, no.
So, just to be clear, you actually rebooted them over 800 times, and all of these reports of their torture are completely fake? Yes, but frankly, this is on you.
A lot of those details I just took directly from Stephen King novels and episodes of "Pretty Little Liars.
" Just tell me why, why would you do this? It's not like I planned it.
They were bad people.
This is not supposed to be possible, so the only explanation is that somehow, there was a mistake made and these people belong in the Good Place.
No they don't, idiot.
Shawn, this is not fair.
Pft, fair is the stupidest word humans ever invented, except for BOTH: Staycation, ew.
Look, those four humans are good people and they deserve a staycation in the Good Place, and I bet the Judge will feel the same way.
I doubt she even hears their case.
But if she does, one of them will screw it up.
Can we get rid of him already? Yep.
It's time.
Follow me.
Okay.
Eleanor and Chidi.
Looks like you guys are up.
At the same time? [GIGGLE] Yep.
[DEEP BREATH] [MELLOW MUSIC] [LAUGHS] Trippy, right? There is no test.
- [DINGS] Take these medallions and go right through that portal, and you're there in a jiff.
[GASPS] - We made it.
- We made it.
- We made it.
- Holy crap! [LAUGHTER, CHEERING] All those ethics lessons paid off.
Whoever said philosophy was stupid? - You did, many times.
- [SQUEALS] - As recently as this morning.
- Whoo! But-but you also worked really hard and you deserve this.
It's just the two of you.
Tahani and Jason didn't make it.
I'm giving them tests right now to determine where they belong within the Bad Place, so you might wanna reconsider that judges-together thing 'cause if you stick to that, you're all going down.
I am so hungry.
Why am I so hungry? Oh, my I'm such an idiot.
I forgot to eat my burrito.
And I was so hungry, too.
What a dork.
Hey, Judge.
- We figured out what you're really - Nope.
Tahani and Jason have not been given the same offer.
Here, take a look.
Tahani's test is to walk down the hallway and not get tempted by her gossiping friends.
Jason is playing video games.
Oh.
Okay, cool.
It's actually not hot sauce.
It's envy.
Or, the concept of envy.
It's really good on Mexican food, it gives it a little kick.
[SIGHS] Okay, so what do we do? [GROANS] Oh no, that was your moral quandary grimace, which is different from your gas pain grimace.
[MEWLS] And different from your someone said "from whence it came" instead of "whence it came" grimace.
[SIGHS] - [SIGHS] - So, spit it out, man.
Well, if this isn't a test, then it's something way worse.
[INQUISITIVE MUSIC] QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis and Stephen Hawking in the same room discussing me? Guess they must've made up.
Focus.
There'll be Fergies a-plenty in the Good Place.
[TENDER MUSIC] [SIGHS] I don't know where we went wrong with Tahani.
I know, she is such a disappointment compared to her sister.
Hello, Father.
Hello, Mother.
Oh, hello, Tahani.
How's it going in here? I'm losing by three.
Meditating to calm myself down.
I'd be winning by, like, a million if I could play as the Jags instead of playing against the Jags.
I hate scoring against my own favorite team.
[FOREBODING MUSIC] But you already knew that.
Because this is the test! Yeah, that's not a revelation or something.
I explained that very clearly.
It's nice to see you, Tahani.
Apologies, it's been a while since we've seen you.
We have so much to tell you about your sister.
We've just heard the most wonderful news.
Kamilah dedicated her last album to you.
Really? Well, she dedicated it to her fans and you're one of her fans.
The whole point of this afterlife test is that everyone in these rooms is supposed to be talking about me.
And yet, even in this scenario, you are still talking about Kamilah.
Which is exactly the point.
You know, I've done things that you would never have approved of.
I died, dressed as someone in the service industry, I shagged a Floridian, I even ate a Cheeto.
- BOTH: [GASP] - That's right.
Chewing it was deafening.
And it's the happiest I have ever been.
Don't get upset, dear.
You barely fit in that dress, and I'm afraid you're going to hulk out, as it were.
Okay.
[SIGHS] All right, idiot, any last words? [STAMMERS] Go ahead and retire me already.
Oh, you're not getting retired, Michael.
- I'm not? - No, retirement is a spectacle.
Everyone would see the flaming ladles go down your throat.
Everyone would hear your eternal shrieks of agony, blah, blah, blah, then they'd ask me what you did.
I don't need that kind of scrutiny right now.
- [DING] - So, I'm just gonna throw you in this unmarked room - for the rest of eternity.
- [GRUNTS] And since it seems you love humans so much, I'll torture you like one.
You and I both know I'll never read those.
Of course you won't.
But they'll just keep coming.
BOTH: [SINISTER CHUCKLING] Goodbye, Michael.
We will leave you with one of Bad Janet's classic farts.
The smell will linger for 10 million years.
All right, here comes the boom! Oh wait, actually, before I absolutely let it rip, I just have one more thing I have to do.
What? [UPBEAT MUSIC] It's me, Good Janet.
That was a trick.
I realized if we wanted our friends to have any chance of survival, I had to learn how to do a lot of bad things really quickly.
So, I did.
Now I'm ready to go back to being nice again.
[GROANS] What happened? [GRUNTS] Okay, now I'll be nice again.
[SIGH] Could you please stop doing that? It helps me think.
We've been through every argument.
Contractualist, Kantian, what would Superman do, what would Rihanna do are we missing anything? Hit me right now with your most obscure, boring-est, old white dude with a long wizard beard mumbo-jumbo.
But let's forget about the ethics for a second.
After everything that's happened, don't we deserve to be together and happy for once? [GENTLE MUSIC] Judge? Have you made your decision? Yeah.
We're not going to the Good Place.
I mean, that was never actually an option, but for the sake of your test, we're not going.
What do you mean? Well, I was 99% sure that going was the wrong move, but since our whole relationship has been me being sure of something and Chidi explaining why I was wrong, I owed it to him to quadruple check.
The capper came when I realized that ain't Chidi.
The Chidi I know wouldn't argue that he should be rewarded while his friends got punished, and he would never "forget about ethics for a second.
" I don't know who this joker is, but it's not Chidi Anagonye.
And can I have that medallion back 'cause it's actually a coaster for my sodas? Mm-hmm.
Where is the real Chidi, though? Is he okay? He's still taking his test.
[TICKING] Okay, this is ridiculous.
Um I'm just gonna choose Brown.
Gray's the obvious choice, which is probably why I shouldn't choose it.
Brown.
Nope.
Gray.
Brown hat.
[DING] [MELLOW MUSIC] All right, fun stuff.
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Feeling good? - Very.
- I think so, yes.
Great.
You're all going to the Bad Place.
Okay, um, if I was the one who failed, could you at least tell me why I failed, for my own edification? It took you 82 minutes to choose a hat.
Come on, man.
Ugh.
Tahani, you skipped a lot of rooms that I thought would entice you, but you weren't supposed to open any doors, and you couldn't resist confronting your parents.
Sorry, everyone.
But now that I failed, can I go back in and talk to Winston Churchill and Freddie Mercury? No.
Jason, your test was about impulse control, and you showed great improvements, but you never asked if you could opt not to play.
I mean, you basically told me, an all-knowing judge, to just shut up and go away.
Do you realize how insane that is? Not as insane as picking off the greatest quarterback of all time, Black Bortles, to set up a last second game-winning field goal.
So, we all failed, let's not dwell on it.
[INHALES] All right, shall we? [PORTALS WHIRRING] [IMPISH MUSIC] Oh, I am gonna miss you guys.
I made a little video of our time together.
[DING] [BETTE MIDLER'S "WIND BENEATH MY WINGS" PLAYING] Oh, look, there we are.
You know, I thought I'd have a stomachache right now, but weirdly And everything I would I do.
There's my guy.
- What? - Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna miss you, bud.
- [DING] - We gave it our best shot, guys.
I say we go through the portal, get a good night's sleep, come back fresh in the morning.
Try again.
Oh, Jason.
I feel like you always understand about 20% of what's happening.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
[SNIFFS] I mean, look at us.
Do you hear something? [FAINT YELLING] Hey! Oh! - [GASP] - Hey, guys.
How you been?
 So, Michael, you're saying there's a new angle I should consider in this case? Love that.
Major drama.
[CHUCKLING] Spill the tea, sweetheart.
The premise of our system is that a person's score during her time on Earth is final and inarguable, but because of my accidental experiment, these four humans got better after they died.
That's not supposed to be possible.
Over and over again, I watched as they became thoughtful and generous and caring.
And now he's so much better.
I was already pretty good.
When I was six, I hit one right on the button.
Okay, let the immortal beings talk, darling.
So they got better in your little pretend world.
That doesn't prove anything about what they were like on Earth.
No, see, I think it does prove something.
If I'm right, the system by which we judge humans the very method we use to deem them good or bad is so fundamentally flawed and unreasonable that hundreds of millions of people have been wrongly condemned to an eternity of torture.
Huh, yeah.
Doesn't happen very often.
Wow, so you saw your parents in the test? Yes.
And I immediately fell right back into my old pattern, desperately trying to impress them and earn their admiration.
Then I heard this little voice in my head saying, "Tahani, don't do this.
" The little voice in your head sounds like the old lady from "Downton Abbey.
" Oh, yeah, sorry.
Maggie Smith is my godmother.
You have made so much progress.
I'm proud of you, hot stuff.
Whatever progress I have made, it's because you and I have become mates.
That's British for "friends.
" No, I know.
- [CHUCKLES] - Man.
Think about everything that's happened to us.
We died, Michael tortured us, we teamed up with him, we escaped, we went through the Portal, The Judge ruled against us, then Michael showed up.
Hi, Jason.
I love you.
Oh, word? Word.
I've been avoiding telling you.
My excuse was that I needed time to evaluate my complex feelings, but that was just a rationalization.
This might be the last time I ever get to talk to you, so there it is I love you.
And I hereby stop avoiding this topic and rationalizing by saying the situation is complicated.
Or that my brain is grinding like a fork in a garbage disposal.
You're not really a part of this, Chidi.
Hey, guess what.
I think I love you too, girl.
I'm not a girl.
I'm also not just a Janet anymore.
I don't know what I am.
[SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hey, man.
What's up? Hot diggity dog.
It was an honest reaction.
I stand by it.
Hi, guys.
Couple quick announcements.
Would anyone eat chips and guac if I put it out? It's good.
It's homemade.
No takers? A'ight.
Second thing: we figured out a plan to save your souls.
And while you're there, I'll keep working every angle I can think of to get you guys into the Good Place, for real.
This is great.
So we'd all be together? Oh, no, that's the thing about Medium Places it has to be tailored to what's medium for the individuals.
So if you're all together, it ain't medium.
How much time will we be alone? Hard to say.
Uh, could be a month.
Could be a million years.
So, between a month and a million years.
Come on, you guys, I know this isn't perfect, but I need more time to build my case, and it's either this or back to the Bad Place.
Yeah.
I'll say it.
Both those options suck.
Okay, I'm sorry if that's blunt, Your Honor, but it's true.
Also, Chidi just laid one on me, so I'm kinda dizzy.
You two kissed? Hot diggity dog! That's what I said! The point is, we've all gotten better.
Why should we have to go live alone in a boring void because of a messed-up system? - How is that justice? - Okay.
Second, I still believe that the only reason that you improved in Michael's fake neighborhood is because you thought there was a reward at the end of the rainbow.
You're supposed to good things because you're good! Not because you're seeking moral desert.
And I still believe that they would've become good people if they'd just gotten a [DRAMATIC MUSIC] A push in the right direction.
Oh, no.
Nope, nope.
Absolutely not.
- It's a little crazy - A little bit crazy? It's Looney Tunes.
- What are they talking about? - No idea.
And it's clearly the best way to see if bad people can become good without knowing anything about what's waiting for them in the afterlife.
Shotgun.
Whatever they're talking about, if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun.
It's never gonna work, man.
If it doesn't, then they go right back to the Bad Place.
- [SIGHS] - No one gets hurt.
Except them, forever.
And me, I assume, also.
- Yes! Ha! I don't know why.
I'm just feeling kinda funky.
But there have to be strict rules.
Otherwise, the results will be tainted, and I reserve the right to change my mind - at any point.
- About what?! Would someone who's not an eternal being please explain to me what the f [SNAPS FINGERS] Why are you like this? Excuse me? Why am I like this? You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.
Look what you made me do, jagoff.
[SIGHS] Look out! Uh-oh.
She needs to know what was said.
[OVERLAPPING CHATTER] God, Eleanor, take longer next time.
Oh, you look like crap.
I was outside the supermarket arguing with that little environmental twerp - Ugh, I hate that guy.
- Really? That skinny little hippy body kinda turns me on.
- Gross.
- Guys, listen.
I dropped the margarita mix, and when I went to pick it up, a bunch of shopping carts came right at me, and I was just frozen.
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.
That's crazy.
So is the margarita mix, like, gone? I had a near death experience recently.
You know that old warehouse that burned down last month and, like, four people died? That building is, like, right by my old dentist.
If I still went to that dentist and I had an appointment that day, I would've been like right near there.
I was in Syracuse, New York, like two weeks before 9/11.
- No way! - Yeah, 14 days.
I'm rude, I'm selfish, I cyberbullied Ryan Lochte until he quit Instagram, but something happened to me today, and from now on, I'm gonna try to become a better, kinder, more generous person.
Hey, can I use your credit card? You know what? Yes, you can.
Cool.
It's for porn.
I already used it.
[PLEASANT MUSIC] Hey.
You look happy.
You get laid last night? I didn't.
This chick that I met after I followed her into a yoga class, but she wasn't into it.
Maced me.
Right in the eyes.
Stung like hell.
What was I saying? Oh, yeah.
Hey.
Listen, dude.
What you're doing here selling fake medicine to people, tricking them is wrong.
I'm trying to become a better person, and as long as I work here Yeah, sure, fine, whatever, you quit, who cares? Give me your company ID.
Thank you.
And your parking pass.
- And your panties, please.
- Dude.
What? Come on.
I had to try.
By the way, technically, that is not sexual harassment, because she doesn't work here anymore.
Good timing on your part.
Dude, get help.
I'm becoming a better person.
You should, too.
Hey, Eleanor, do you want to come to Lauren's baby shower? Do you want to chew on my ass sortment of brownies that I will be bringing to Lauren's baby shower? S-sure.
Hi there, do you have a second to talk about the environment? Hey.
Remember me? Ah! Don't hurt me.
My bones are brittle.
I came to apologize.
There.
I did it.
I apologized.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, assface.
[CLEARS THROAT] Nope.
You're right.
There's really no excuse.
Thanks.
Apology accepted.
Uh, what's happening? I'm scared.
Hey, I'm on kinda like a self-improvement kick.
Do you think you could help me out, teach me to get all horny for the environment or whatever? Hey, everyone.
This is Eleanor.
She's joining the team.
Hi.
[COUNTERS TICKING] All right, Eleanor.
[GASPS] [THE SUBMARINES' "MAYBE"] There is a sign Among the remnants Of all our words Best left unsaid And when the truth Flies in our direction Do we work it through Or lose our heads CHORUS: Maybe, maybe, maybe we're strong Maybe, maybe, maybe we're wrong Mm, babes, get in on these nachos.
- They're delish.
- Mmm, mm-hmm.
I'm actually trying to eat vegetarian.
Ew! Why? Is it because you feel bad for all the widdle animals with their cute widdle faces because people stuff them into tiny cages just so that we can eat them? Yeah.
That's exactly why.
I do.
I mean, I went through a really rough time last year with the whole Dress Bitch thing and people selling T-shirts with my face on them, but you two stuck by me.
- I love you, you dumb sluts! - Come on.
- [GIGGLING] Okay, there's probably something we should tell you.
Or not.
We could also not.
We have to.
It's the right thing to do.
But, we did not keep the money.
Yes, we did.
We kept all the money.
And I'm really sorry.
Okay.
That took a lot of courage - for you to admit that - Mm-hmm.
And I admire your honesty.
You stupid skank! How could you do that to me?! I hate you! You're both disgusting hogs, and I want you to move out of my apartment forever literally starting right now! I'm still really glad we told the truth.
Steamed vegetable medley and ice water.
Can I just get the check? And can you throw these plants in the trash? Such a long time now We're doing battle with our own Familiar inhibitions Far away from Home Our trusty compass fails to find This strange and new position Maybe, maybe, maybe we're strong But maybe, maybe, maybe we're strong But maybe, maybe Maybe we're wrong [SIGHS] Damn it.
They're suing you?! This chick is claiming she has whiplash.
She wasn't in the car when I hit it! This is on you.
You should've pretended like you didn't see it and walked away, like everyone else does.
I know! I've hit your car like six times and never said anything.
But I'm trying to be good! [SNICKERING] How is that working out for you? [LAUGHING] [COUNTER TICKING] - [KNOCK AT DOOR] - It's open, dummy.
Eleanor, where have you been? Oh, hey, man.
Uh, I know we don't pay a lot, but this is a job, and we need to know we can count on you.
We're meeting tonight to discuss long-term strategy for the organization.
I really think Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
Oh, sorry to interrupt whatever boring crap this is, but dude, you need to get dressed.
I got tickets to Taylor Splift.
The Taylor Swift reggae cover band.
They're terrible.
It's gonna be amazing.
- I'ma do that.
- Eleanor! What?! What, dude? I've been nothing but good for, like, six months, and all I have to show for it is this crummy apartment, a lawsuit, a loose caboose, and an overdrawn bank account.
Being good is for suckers.
What do you even get out of it? A feeling of fulfillment in your soul.
Gross.
That's the grossest sentence I've ever heard, okay? I quit.
Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch.
Oof! I still think he's kinda hot.
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where we, like, feed him soup.
So tell me about the new business.
We sell classes at a for-profit university, and the classes train people how to sell supplements.
So it's a Ponzi scheme within a Ponzi scheme? - That sounds kinda dicey.
- Oh, it's super dicey.
But I'm in witness protection, so technically, I can't be convicted of any crime.
Well, that's definitely not true, but I also don't care.
Yeah! Dude, my boyfriend just texted.
His wife's out of town, so I'm gonna head over there.
- Mwah! - What? That's lame.
- Boo! - Happy birthday! Hello, bartender.
One alcohol drink, please.
It's my birthday, if you want to give it to me for free.
[CHUCKLES] I always say that, but it actually is my birthday.
- Hmm.
And now I'm here.
Sounds like you had a pretty crazy year.
- Hm.
- Wanna talk about it? And in the end, Anthony Anderson and Jerry O'Connell start a successful shampoo company and you see the kangaroo jumping around Australia.
[SNORTS] That is the plot of the movie "Kangaroo Jack.
" - Why did I tell you that? - It's unclear.
You know the thing is, the problem really, with being a do-gooder? - What's that? - No one cares.
I mean, some people care a little bit.
And what did I get for it? Ah, see, now you're talking about moral desert.
Exactly.
Wait, I am? What? Moral desert is the concept that if you act with virtue, you deserve a reward.
Right.
If I'm not gonna get rewarded somehow, like a tiara or one of those diagonal award belts - Sash.
- Sure.
Then why should I do good things? You know, I had a friend that said whenever she was doing something bad, she'd hear this this little voice in her head, distant little voice, saying, "Oh, come on now.
You know this is wrong.
Your friend sounds like she's one pick short of a pickle party.
[SNORTS] She's a little rough around the edges, but she was also a really good person, when she tried.
See, I think that little voice was her conscience, trying to guide her in the right direction.
I gotta go home.
What do I owe ya? The real question, Eleanor, is what do we owe to each other? What? Did I sell you a drink? - Am I a bartender? - [CHUCKLES] Drinks are on me.
Good luck.
Ow.
[REFLECTIVE MUSIC] Anybody notice I was gone? Nope.
No thanks.
We all have a voice in our head.
That voice doesn't tell us what to do or not do, but it does warn us when we do things that don't feel good or right.
The difference between the term "reasonable," what does it mean to be a reasonable person? I may have a different definition of reasonable so why do it then? Why choose to be good every day if there is no guaranteed reward we can count on, now or in the afterlife? I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people and our innate desire to treat them with dignity.
Simply put, we are not in this alone.
Hey, dong bait, didn't you get my message? Let's go.
Time is booze.
Yeah, no thanks.
Where you headed? St.
John's University, please.
No worries.
- Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Office hours are on Tuesday.
Oh, I I'm not a student.
Are you Chidi Ana kendrick? Anagonye, and yes.
- Great.
Hi.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
Can we talk? Okay.
Here we go.
I still believe that they would have become good people if they'd just gotten a push in the right direction.
[TENSE MUSIC] - Oh, no! - What are they talking about? - No idea.
- It's only four people, and it's clearly the best way to see if bad people can become good without knowing anything about what's waiting for them in the afterlife.
Otherwise, the results will be tainted, and I reserve the right to change my mind at any point.
Would someone who's not an eternal being please explain to me what the f [TENTATIVE MUSIC] Hi, I'm Michael.
You must be The Doorman.
Ah.
This is wild.
I had no idea this was even here.
So I have this ruling from The Judge.
Heading on down to Earth to reverse the deaths of these four people.
So, how long's this trip take? Hope I don't get a middle seat.
[SNAPS, CHUCKLES] Wow, I haven't heard a joke in 8,000 years.
And I still haven't.
That's the door to Earth.
You go through there, you'll be wherever you need to be.
You won't have any other powers, though.
You want to get around, you're just going to have to - take a bus or something.
- A bus? Oh, boy, oh, man! I'm going to sit in a front-facing seat.
It is one of a kind and cannot be duplicated.
See? "Do Not Duplicate.
" Only I touch this key.
Oh, and what's the significance of the keychain? Nothing, I just like frogs.
I'm a frog guy.
When you need to get back here, make sure you're alone.
Press this button.
Any questions? No? Great.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC] I-I'm sorry, but this is an important moment - On your right, mate! - Oh, jeez, watch it, man! [YELLS] Come down! Come down where you belong.
[SCREAMS] Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.
[GROANS] Oh, wow! I was just on Earth.
It was incredible.
The the traffic, the pigeons.
And I saw this place that was, at once, a Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell! I mean, oh! The mind reels.
A Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell! Ah! [BRIGHT MUSIC] Oh, Janet, it was everything I ever imagined.
And then someone came up to me and said, "Hot enough for ya?" And you know what I said? I said, "Tell me about it.
" [LAUGHS] Well, I am glad that you got to chew a gumball.
Oh, damn.
I didn't even think to chew it.
Missed opportunity, shoot.
Did you also save their lives? Yes, of course.
Everyone is safe.
Including Jason.
What do you even get out of it? I quit.
Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch.
[WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Morning, Chidi.
Blueberry muffin for ya? Uh, I don't know, maybe.
I can't decide.
- You all right there, mate? - Okay, I've made my decision.
I want to start crying.
[LOUD SOB] Hey, Tahani Al-Jamil.
- Where are we, exactly? My pied-a-terre, just off the coast of "Barthelona.
" What's one thing people don't know about you? That I was such a tomboy in high school.
- See? - Wow! Looking good.
Okay, next question.
Who would you say is the most famous person in your phone? It's not about who you know.
Enlightenment comes from within.
The Dalai Lama texted me that.
K, will you make me the happiest man in the world, and agree to be my wife? No.
Plus, bonus you get half the stuff I stole.
Yep, he just confessed to the robbery.
Damn it.
[EXHALES] You realize what the problem is, right? Yes, but there's no way to help.
Maybe there is.
In the afterlife, they all got better because they helped each other.
And the key to that was Chidi and Eleanor's connection.
If I get the two of them together, - everything else will follow.
Oh, and then maybe I'll visit Chidi and make sure that he helps her when she shows up.
I'm just going to nudge the two of them together.
Just nudge-y nudge nudge.
The Judge was pretty clear in her instructions, and The Judge is, you know, The Judge of, you know, the universe.
She'll never find out.
She spends all her time in her chambers bingeing TV shows.
She's watching all of "NCIS" right now.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Hey, there.
Yeah.
You know, The Judge said to use the same ones.
Because I'm, uh, you know, visiting the same people.
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
I brought you a nice hot cup of antimatter.
I usually only drink decaf antimatter.
- Ah.
- Eh, I'll take it.
Ooh.
- What do I owe ya? - The real question, Eleanor, is what do we owe to each other? What do we owe to each other? That is the question Tim Scanlon asked decades ago, and it is the question I will try to answer over the next three hours.
Are you Chidi Anna Kendrick? Anagonye, and yes.
Great, hi.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
- Can we talk? - Sure.
Okay, uh, where do I start? I'm not, like, the best person in the world.
I'm a trash bag from Arizona, which is saying something.
I've been flying for like, 40 hours.
This is Australia, right? Yes.
I grew up in Senegal, so my native language is French.
But I went to American schools, so I also speak English.
- Oh.
- And German and Greek.
And Latin, just in case it ever comes back.
Cool.
I did cheat.
But you were saying something crazy happened to you? Yes, uh, I almost died.
And it made me want to become a better person, which I did for a while.
But then I fell back into my old trash bag ways.
Yesterday, I saw your lecture, and something just clicked.
Wait, you flew all the way here from Arizona just to see me? You know what, don't flatter yourself, pal.
Sorry, that's a knee-jerk reaction.
Yes, that's exactly what I did.
What do you say? Will you help me become a good person? [SOFT MUSIC] - Yes.
- [CHUCKLES] [INHALES] I'll start you off with some introductory philosophy books, and then we'll meet here once a week.
Great.
Ideally, some of those books will have been made into a movie or maybe a funny GIF.
But anything's good with me, man.
- Can I ask you something? - Mm-hmm.
Why are you helping me? I'm a teacher.
That's my job.
There's got to be another reason.
Yes, there is.
Um I also had a near-death experience.
- Whoa.
- Well, I mean, I don't know for sure that I would have died, but, it was pretty nuts.
I'm sorry, but this is an important moment in our friendship - On your right, mate! - Oh, jeez.
Watch it, man! [YELLS] Oh, my God.
Are you okay? That that is right where I was standing.
I shouldn't be using air conditioners.
The freon is awful for the environment.
That's the lesson you take from this? Chidi, your brain is broken.
You need to fix your brain.
So in a nutshell, I have a 3,600-page thesis that I am nowhere near finishing, I am absolutely paralyzed by decision-making, and it is destroying my life.
Yeah, I sort of got that when you couldn't choose a chair to sit on.
Well, I didn't want to offend you in case you had a favorite.
Look, I know I just kind of nope walked in here, and you don't know me at all, but is there any way to tell if my indecision is due to a brain thing? Um, yeah, sure.
The fun part is you're awake the whole time.
Uh I'm kidding! I'll just give you an MRI and look at the part of your brain that controls decision-making.
Oh, I want that.
I need to learn about my brain, please.
Well, so you just march into my office unannounced, tell me your brain is broken, then demand I drop everything and just put you in the university's $3 million MRI machine? Oh, I'm sorry, I just I freaking love it.
You're so weird! Let's go.
- Right now? - Oh, yeah, come on.
Oh okay.
Yours looks great, very strong.
Gorgeous hippocampus here! [BOTH LAUGH] This is your ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the center of decision-making.
This is where the magic happens.
Do you see how it's all lit up? That's a flurry of activity that occurred when I asked you to choose between red and blue, and you almost passed out.
Is it too late to pick blue instead? It is, yeah.
The point is, at first glance, your brain is very healthy.
Huh, there are actual answers here, data you can observe and learn from.
Yeah, man, science is all about getting answers.
- [LAUGHS] - No offense.
Oh, none taken.
We suck.
- Yeah.
- [BOTH LAUGH] [UPBEAT MUSIC] - Chidi.
- One blueberry muffin, please.
Why choose to be good every day? I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people.
Simply put, we are not in this alone.
You chose that muffin in less than a minute.
That beats your old record by 59 minutes.
Henry, I feel amazing.
I am 100 pages into my new thesis, and it is some of the best writing that I have ever done.
I haven't been this happy since Oh, wow.
I've never been happy.
- Ha! - Bad! I'm proud of you, mate.
It must be really nice to live that way.
Just decide to be more decisive.
Like, what's something that you've always wanted to do? I mean, I have been putting off getting in shape.
Then make the decision to wake up tomorrow morning and get in shape.
It is that easy.
Okay.
Maybe I will! - What have you got to lose? - Nothing! Henry, what happened to you? Well, I was using the leg press at the gym, and you know how your legs bend a certain way? My legs bend the other way now.
Oh, no.
All the tendons in my legs snapped like violin strings, and then, my foot flew forwards, and I kicked myself in the face, which gave me a concussion.
- I'm famous.
- This is all my fault.
I did this to you.
Oh oh, muffins! I brought blueberry muffins.
Oh, no, you shouldn't eat blueberries anymore.
Read an article.
The migrant workers who pick them are horribly mistreated.
Yaaaaaaah! [BRIGHT MUSIC] Good morning, Chidi.
- You all right there, mate? - Okay, I've made my decision.
I want to start crying.
[WHEELS SQUEAK] [BRIGHT MUSIC] Excuse me? What is the maximum number of books that I can check out? - Is it 12,000? - Got a wild weekend planned? Well, I need to find a new topic for my thesis, and I had this thing happen that made me more decisive, and a few months ago, my friend broke both of his legs, and it's my fault, and blueberries, and I need help.
- Whoo! - Maybe that help will come from Tay Zonday's autobiography, "Chocolate Book.
" I mean, who's to say? Mate, I've worked in this library a long time, and I've seen a lot of academic types with that same helpless look on their faces.
They all made it through okay.
- Once they learned the secret.
- What's the secret? There's a secret? Is the secret more books? - How many more books do I need? - It's not about books, mate.
Get out of your own head.
Trust me.
The next time someone asks for help, say yes.
[SOFT MUSIC] A few hours later, you walked in and asked for help.
Now, I don't know if this is going to solve all of my problems, but it's worth a try, right? Well, thank you, sexy librarian guy.
I didn't say he was sexy.
Oh, I know, but whenever anyone tells me a story about their life, I always imagine all the people as being super hot.
Otherwise, I quickly lose interest.
- Uh-huh, flawless.
- Thank you.
But the point is, Eleanor and Chidi are together, and now we can relax.
Everything is finally on track.
[TENSE MUSIC] - Status report.
- They're plugging away, but we still can't hack into The Judge's system.
Damn it, those four humans have been on Earth for over a year.
I need to know if they're getting better.
Forget I asked.
Serves him right for questioning you, boss.
I think you're doing a great job.
Thank you, Todd.
- No, no, no, no - Why did you do that? I'm a demon.
It's fun.
No one leaves this room until we've accessed The Judge's system.
Would music help? Should I play some music? Good idea.
That's the stuff.
So for Aristotle, virtue is practical.
Goodness isn't something that a person just inherently has.
It's something that she achieves through her actions.
- Questions? - Uh, yeah, a few.
I wrote down "what?" "huh?" And then this doodle of a burrito because when I first read Aristotle, I thought it was pronounced like Chipotle.
Wait a minute, is it "Chip-o-tottle"? These are all great questions.
But I have to meet my thesis adviser across campus.
Hey, so, I've been trying to figure out how to pay you back for helping me.
I told you, you don't owe me anything.
At home, when I want to get something nice for one of my friends, it usually comes in the form of something edible.
You get what I'm saying? An "edible" thing? - Please don't buy me drugs.
- Okay, copy that.
I had no choice, I was in his driveway taking pictures when he walked out, so I said "Hey, Mr.
Crowe, I'm from the gas company.
" - "I loved you in 'Gladiator.
- No, it's not that.
[LAUGHS] Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys haven't met yet.
- Um, Simone, this is Eleanor.
- The famous Simone.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
So I've got to do some MRI scans as a control for an experiment.
Well, just come by my lab at 6:00 and then afterwards, I can buy you dinner as a thank you.
Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.
Oh, okay.
Well, uh, I'll see you later.
Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
- Yeah.
[BRIGHT MUSIC] - What? - Uh, you and Simone had some real professor dork vibes flowing.
I'm scared of everything, and I can't just do things like that.
- Just drop it, okay? - Well Okay, just promise me you'll drop it.
Okay.
I promise.
So you're into Chidi, right? I mean, forgive my bluntness, but I'm usually right about these things.
Well, yeah, but I made it pretty clear a bunch of times, and he's never responded, so I just assumed he wasn't interested.
Okay, I'm all set.
I'm just going to ask you some basic questions, Chidi.
What color are Simone's eyes? Brown.
Uh uh, what? If you could take Simone anywhere on a date, where would you take her? Sorry, is this part of the experiment? It is now, yes.
Please answer the question.
And keep in mind, we can see your brain.
Next question.
You are into Simone.
- That's not a question.
- So you agree it's a fact.
- Chidi, same question for you.
Are you annoyed at yourself for waiting so long to ask out Simone? I mean, I'm annoyed with you, and I've only known you three weeks.
Yes, I am obviously very annoyed with myself.
Can I get out now? No, you can't.
It'll ruin the science.
There's only one question left, and you got to ask it, bud.
[SOFT MUSIC] Simone, would you like to have dinner with me? Wow, that is highly inappropriate.
- Uh - I'm just kidding.
- Aw, cute.
- This is a disaster.
Michael, relax.
How are the two of them going to bond? There were plenty of reboots where Eleanor and Chidi weren't even soul mates, and he still always helped her.
Simone and Chidi are good together.
I've been running simulations on what their kids will be like.
One of them is hot enough to be on "The Bachelor" and smart enough to never go on "The Bachelor.
" This is not just about Chidi.
I'm going back down.
You're pressing your luck.
If you keep disobeying Mommy, something bad is going to happen.
- What? - Oh, I don't have a mom, so I've been experimenting with thinking of The Judge as my mom.
- It's weird, forget it.
- Okay.
How are you even going to get Jason and Tahani to Australia? I have no idea, but I have to try.
Well, good luck, Dad.
Hey, bud.
Brought you some decaf hazelnut antimatter.
Just a little treat for my old pal, The Doorman.
Heading back down, by the way.
You sure The Judge is okay with you going back to Earth so many times? Oh, yeah, yeah, all good.
See, still got the papers.
Shouldn't be long.
[LIGHTLY TENSE MUSIC] [KEYBOARD CLACKING] How are we doing, Steve? I'm trying.
No pressure.
[TENSE MUSIC] - [COMPUTER BEEPS] - Aha! Someone just went down to Earth, and that gave me a back door into The Judge's system.
Now we can see everything that's happening with all four humans.
[GASPS] - Excellent work, Steve.
- [EXHALES] Uh-oh, looks like someone's been cocooning again.
You know, it would be a real help if you let me know the next time you were about to [TENSE MUSIC] Well, well, well.
Looks like Michael's been caught with his hand in the human jar.
- Good one, boss.
Ready to discuss philosophy.
Obviously, I'm kidding.
How was your date with Simone? Spill it, sweetheart.
We had a great time.
Thank you again for bullying me into asking her out.
Well, I owed it to you.
And bonus, I realized I was practicing virtue ethics by helping the two of you bone down.
Okay, not appropriate.
But if you must know, it was very chaste.
We didn't even kiss.
- Because you chickened out? - I did! Yeah, I totally chickened out, and I am so mad at myself.
Well, hey, maybe it wasn't the right moment.
Knowing the two of you nerds, your first kiss is going to be while reading Plato in an MRI machine.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, hang on.
Come with me.
Simone, what's the one thing Eleanor and I have in common? You both have a complete disregard for my office hours.
Look, listen, Eleanor is an Arizona trash bag.
- Yep.
- Her words, not mine.
- Totally.
- Who once told me that her greatest accomplishment was breaking into Charles Barkley's house.
Mm.
He was on the road.
I snuck in through the doggy door.
Listen, the point is, Eleanor and I have nothing in common except that we both almost died, and it made us want to be better people.
This is my thesis idea.
I will explore the effect of near-death experiences on ethical decision-making.
I will get a group of people together who have had near-death experiences, ask them ethical questions, and see if there's any commonalities! That's great! Why are you yelling it at me? Because I need your help! You and your magic brain scan machine.
Oh, of course! A joint study with the neuroscience department.
We can use MRI mapping to see if a near-death experience alters brain function.
There's something there, right? Definitely, I love this.
Great.
I want that, please.
[SOFT MUSIC] Oh, sorry, Reginald.
What were you saying? Um, that I can't come to class tomorrow - 'cause my grandma died.
- Oof.
Real mood ruiner.
Read the room, dude.
[BRIGHT MUSIC] Bingo.
Okay.
Hello, Eleanor.
Delighted to meet you.
Al-Jamil.
Oh, you're Kamilah's sister.
I am, yes.
If you want an autograph or something, I can probably arrange it.
Eh, I was never really that into her no offense.
Oh, [LAUGHS] I assure you, there is none taken.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC] Come down! Come down where you belong.
Aah! [SCREAMS, COMMOTION] - Well done, Tahani.
- Who saved me? Did anyone see who just saved my life? - It was Kamilah! - No, it was a man, I think.
- It was Kamilah! - It was Kamilah! No, it wasn't Kamilah! It was someone over there.
ALL: Kamilah, Kamilah, Kamilah, Kamilah, Kamilah! I had almost died.
And in that very moment, I decided to change my life.
First, I cleansed myself of all the worldly possessions that had been weighing me down like anchors the dresses, the jewels.
I gave them all to Good Will.
Sure.
Then I deleted all my celebrity contacts from my mobile.
Good-bye, Bono.
Good-bye, The Edge.
Good-bye, The Edge's real phone number that even Bono doesn't have.
And most importantly, I put physical distance between me and my old life.
Book me a flight to Tibet.
I'm going to live in a Buddhist monastery.
- No, I'm flying commercial.
- Okay.
- First class, I assume? - No.
I'm a woman of the people now.
[UPBEAT MUSIC] Comfort Plus.
And there, in that humble monastery, thousands of miles from the meaningless concerns of high society, I embarked upon a quest for enlightenment.
I learned to embrace a life of simplicity.
I meditated.
And I slept.
My soul had never felt so nourished, until one day, my former life came knocking at the open space where a door would have been if we were given any privacy.
Yo, is that Tahani Al-Jamil? Man, it totes is you! What up? I'm Colby, "Squalor News.
" What are you doing in this monastery? Oh, we're doing a new show about poverty, drug lords, gun running, weird-ass restaurants, skateboarding, oh, and also genocide.
It's called "Society is F'ed.
" What are you doing here, though? Is this where you came after your sister saved your life? I am living here as a way to shed my desire for attention.
Toigh, that's what's up! You got to shed that, right? But listen, if you ever want us to do like a monster profile on you and your monk junk, we would be honored AF.
I think people would be supes interested in what you're doing here, for real.
Of course, I never called him to do that profile because I didn't pursue a life of tranquility to get in front of a camera.
I did it to get out of the spotlight.
And that's what my book is about shedding your need for validation from others.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Publisher says you'll hit 2 million copies sold by next week.
Your "582 Questions With" video was nominated for a BAFTA.
- That's fun.
- Also, they want you for "Oprah.
" "Oprah" is off the air.
I checked him out, he's legit.
Tahani.
Gordon Indigo.
I just have to say you are so inspiring.
Aw.
Namaste.
I mean, you really have all these idiots fooled.
- Excuse me? - Listen.
- That's awful.
- No, it's healing.
Wink.
[LAUGHS] You should be selling whatever crap you can think of, because these people will buy it.
- That is quite enough.
- Hm? And how dare you insinuate that I'm not authentic? I finished signing your headshots.
- Oh, not now.
- Ms.
I love what you're doing here.
You get to be rich and famous and not have to do any of the work of helping people.
But I am helping people.
You need to go right now.
Suit yourself.
Look, if you change your mind, I'm online.
Just Google "crystals" that prevent erectile dysfunction.
" [SCOFFS] I'm sorry, but Ms.
I.
Am.
Hello? This is Tahani Al-Jamil.
Oh, hi, I didn't think I'd actually get you.
My name is Chidi Anagonye, and I'm doing an academic study on near-death experiences and ethical decision-making.
I read an article about you Will it help people? That's all I want to know.
Will this help people? Yes, I I think so.
I I mean, that's the goal.
Wow.
But how had you learned about me, I wonder? A professor I'd never heard of named Charles Brainman sent me an article about you.
Said you'd be perfect for our study.
Well, welcome to Australia.
Oh, if you need a place to crash while you get settled, my motel has a pull-out sofa.
Although, as I say that, and I look at you and your whole thing, I realize that's absurd, and you should probably just get your own place.
Yes, I I think that's best.
- But but thank you.
[SOFT MUSIC] Sup, bud? I've been looking for you.
Oh, sorry.
Are these your rocks? No, look.
My name is [SNAPS] Zach Pizazz.
International talent scout.
I've been tracking your dance troupe, man.
I think you really got the goods.
I want you to come on down to Australia and start a new crew, all right? I'll pay for everything.
- But wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You heard what my name was, right? Zach Pizazz? My life is just kind of messed up right now.
I had a really tough year.
- [ROCK SPLASHES] - I'm sorry.
Want to talk about it? I'm a pretty good listener.
Well, my year started about a year ago.
[BLOWS] Pillboi, I can't breathe, and I'm freaking out, and I'm almost out of whip-its! Pillboi! - [POUNDING IN BACKGROUND] - Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.
Yo, that sucks.
- You ready to get back in there? - No, man.
We're not doing this no more.
I almost died trying to rob a Mexican restaurant.
I have to change my life.
[BRIGHT MUSIC] I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to win this dance competition.
So you didn't see any other posters there? No, don't think so.
Homies, I almost died yesterday.
But we've been given a second chance.
Three months from today, on this very stage in the Carmen Electra auditorium, right here at the Smith & Wesson Performing Arts Center and ATV Repair Shop, we are going to win this dance competition.
How, you ask? By working.
We are going to eat, breathe, and vape dance.
I want you thinking about dance 24/7.
That means every day, you think 20 thoughts about dance for seven minutes.
And if you can't promise me that you'll give this dance crew everything that you've got, then you can walk out that door.
I'm out.
What? Come on, Donkey Doug.
After all we've been through? Listen, you know you're my boy, but this sounds like a lot of work.
Good luck.
BOTH: Pew, pew.
Donkey Doug out! Damn, that's a tough blow.
But now that those guys are no longer members of our crew, we can legally rob their houses.
No, Little Peanut.
Right now.
[LOW CHATTER] What? Co Oh, come on We still got like 35 people, so let's get to work.
[APPLAUSE] Quick announcement.
Will the owner of a 1998 Toyota Tercel with golden pythons painted on both sides, license plate GOT-MILF please see an usher.
Your car has exploded.
All right, ya'll ready for the next act? Please give it up right now for Dance Dance Resolution! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [DANCE MUSIC] In the six-year history of this competition, no crew has ever received a perfect score from our judges.
That changed tonight.
But before we get to that, Dance Dance Resolution has been disqualified.
Also, one of your members tried to carjack me - on my way in here.
- No, that was Donkey Doug, and he's not a part of our crew anymore.
We win! We win! ALL: We win, we win, we win! No, again, you are disqualified.
And the winner is Panther Blood! And the winner is Suck Monsters! And the winner is Nobody.
All teams are disqualified due to violence.
[GROANING] Okay, well, we're out of rent money.
So remember that thing I said about no more crime? That's over now.
Go do crime.
Look, please let me go.
I only did it to pay rent for my dance crew's rehearsal space.
Oh, well then, you're in luck.
We only arrest people for robbery if they don't have a reason.
Sorry it took me so long to bail you out.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have used my one phone call to prank the police department.
Man, a year ago, I almost died, and I'm exactly the same as I was before.
You're a dreamer.
Look, I like my job at the old folk's home.
Those old biddies are sweet, and sometimes they give me what they think are candy but are really loose Vicodin.
But when I'm with you, I feel like the sky's the limit.
I feel like someday, I'll be able to buy my own Vicodin.
And it'll never turn out to actually be laxatives.
Thanks, dog, but if my life ended today, what would my legacy be? Sure, I did a wheelie on a dirt bike through an entire Waffle House, and I was once interviewed on the news for finding a foot on the beach.
But yo, other than that, I have no truly great accomplishments.
Do you want a Vicodin right now? So I walked out of that bar, came down to this wharf, threw a rock at a snake, met a guy named Zach Pizazz, talked to him about my crazy year that I've had which started when I was locked in a safe.
No, that was me.
I'm Zach Pizazz.
- We're caught up now.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- A year ago, if you had asked me to run a dance crew in Atlantis - Australia.
- I would have said yes for sure.
My goal in life used to be completely different, too.
I used to, um rep this crew called the Demons.
Whoa, I remember you guys! Didn't you all die when someone brought a hammerhead shark into your hot tub? Different Demons.
The point is, I had to leave my old crew behind, you know? But I met new friends who helped me become a better person.
Look, I know this group of people who are also searching for meaning.
They might be able to help you find what you're looking for.
What do you think? You want to go meet them? Yeah, that sounds great.
Do we have to leave right now? My friend gave me a pill that I realized one second ago was definitely a laxative.
So to thank you for your help, I brought you back something from Earth.
A little token of my appreciation.
It keeps your antimatter warmer for longer.
- It's a frog.
- Yeah.
- There's a frog on it! - Yeah.
Right there, it's a frog! Oh, man, it's green.
It's classic.
- Thank you! - You're welcome.
Wow, that really went over big! [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] How's Jason? Is he still cute? - Oh, he looks about the same.
- That sounds cute.
- Hey, guys.
- Ooh, hey, Judge.
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.
- How's it going? - So good.
I'm just stretching my legs.
Just binged like 300 episodes of "NCIS.
" - Oof! - You know, I'm not a human woman, but that Mark Harmon can get it.
You know what I'm saying? Speaking of human cutiepies, how's that Chidi doing? Oh, sorry, Judge.
Let me just Ooh, hey, you know what you would love - if you like Mark Harmon? - Yeah? "Stealing Home.
" He is very sexy in "Stealing Home" according to the private thoughts of more than 7 million Caucasian women.
Oh, hot tip.
Thanks, girl.
I can whip up some nachos.
- I am incapable of eating, so.
- Suit yourselves.
- Party poopers.
- Ah, party poopers! I guess it'll just be me and Mark, then.
[LAUGHTER] Naughty, naughty.
[DEEPLY INHALES] Oh, boy.
Michael, we almost just got busted.
Oh, we did it, Janet! We got away with it.
[BRIGHT MUSIC] So this is our MRI machine.
Oh, don't don't touch that.
Each of you will get a chance in here eventually.
Hopefully, none of you is claustrophobic.
Clausterphobic? Who would ever be scared of Santa Claus? Oh! The Jewish.
Are you from Florida? - Jacksonville.
- Yeah.
I'll be okay, too.
Kinda of reminds me of the home tanning booth I lost my virginity in.
Wow, I cannot wait to take a look at these three brains.
Oh, forgot to mention.
There's one more person who will be joining us.
Seems like a really interesting guy.
He was almost run over by a train a few months ago.
Heard about the study, emailed me last night.
What's going on? - Oh, no.
- What is it? Something bad, Janet.
Something very dark and evil.
Oh, yes.
Come on in.
- Everyone, this is Trevor.
- Hey, guys.
It is so great to meet you.
Not just any demon.
Trevor is a diabolical, sadistic agent of evil.
Might just be the single most dangerous creature in the universe.
Who wants lemon bars? It's my nana's recipe, and they are just sinful.
Love 'em on my lips but hate 'em on my hips, if you know what I mean.
All right, new guy, coming in strong with free dessert.
You must be Eleanor, the reason this is all happening.
I am.
It's a wonderful thing you've done.
Mm, happy to help you out, buddy.
Oh, we're doing a long hug.
Are you crying? Sorry, I'm just I'm just so happy to be here, if that makes sense.
Okay, the five of us narrowly avoided death.
The operating theory of this experiment is that So, I give them ethics problems, and we scan their brains, and we get a sense of their baseline moral instincts.
Right, then I'll show them pictures that trigger memories of their near-death experiences, we'll scan again, and see if we get a different result.
For example, I'll show Jason pictures of a safe, a snorkel, and whip-it canisters.
Darling, do you remember all the rules about what can and cannot be worn inside an MRI? More specifically, what if one's brassiere is very thin, but also very pure gold? I don't know, but I'm in a similar "situ-aysh," because the sports bra I'm wearing is kind of rust-colored underneath the armpits, so I guess we'll roll the dice together.
Hey, Eleanor, do I have the right phone number for you? You haven't responded to any of the dank memes I've sent.
Oh, yeah, I 'cause I was laughing too hard to reply.
Okay, what's your fave? 'Cause mine's "Damn Daniel.
" Back at it again with the white Vans! Should we get started, maybe? Oh, Mrs.
Teacher, for my turn, is there any way to get, like, extra radiation? There is no radiation in the MRI.
But why do you ask? Uh, no reason.
Jason, what do you got in your hand there, bud? Nothing.
He already bit me a bunch of times and gave me the power to swell up my hand.
- Oh, my God.
- What? Trevor.
Hey, Mikey, fancy seeing you down on Earth completely illegally.
Sweet outfit.
Dick Tracy called.
He said you're a buttface and he's been plowing your mom.
Hey, well, Dick Tracy called me, too, first, and he said he was about to call you and say a lie about me that was actually true about you instead.
What, you think we were just gonna sit around in the Bad Place blowing beefers while you're down on Earth boning us in the meathole? So why didn't Shawn just go to the judge and turn me in? Because this way's more fun, knuckle nuts.
First of all, I'm currently formulating a better comeback to your Dick Tracy burn, and it's gonna devastate you.
Second, you're too late, because when I did this experiment in my neighborhood, every time Eleanor asked Chidi for help, their bond became unbreakable, and the entire group improved.
No, you're right.
There's no way I'll get one of these bozos to drop out of an unpaid, rigorous academic study, especially when they're doing it with me, their overeager new best friend.
Well, I should head back.
You want to come with? Oh, right, they've all seen you already, so you can't show your face to them again, so you're powerless to stop me.
Later days, dingus.
Okay, uh, Simone's gotta analyze the scans, so why don't the rest of you head home? Good first day, everyone.
Hey, teach, um, do you think, maybe, we could continue the one-on-one lessons on the side? I feel like last week, I had my own personal ninja master, and now I'm taking tai chi with a bunch of farting housewives.
Between the new project and my classes, I won't have time, but this is way better.
You're still gonna learn a lot, and you'll have a fun group of people to study with outside of class.
- But - Hey, gang.
I just had a neat idea.
Let's all go sightseeing.
- Dope.
What do you say, E Street Band? You up for a Segway tour of Australia, mate? This is a knife on the barbie.
Cool idea.
I'm just worried that, maybe, it's too cool.
I think I'm just gonna find the nearest bar, have one or eight drinks, and hit the hay.
Even better! We'll all go bend an elbow.
Actually, I know the perfect place for homesick Americans.
Hey, dudes, welcome to the Cowboy Skyscraper Buffet.
Oh, hey, can we get the Florida table? They absolutely nail the swamp stench.
We'll just sit anywhere.
When your table's ready, this gun'll go off.
I think this is real.
So, listen up, y'all.
I was so excited to join the group that I made sweatshirts.
You get a sweatshirt.
You get a sweatshirt.
- You get a sweatshirt.
" Awesome! I love being on teams, and if we're on a team now, we need nicknames.
Optimus, Bumblebee, Jazz, ugh, Megatron.
That's what you can each call me.
Now we need nicknames for you guys.
Ah, this is the best! I'm gonna get the first round, and we are all gonna toast to Eleanor, the reason we're all here.
Yay, Eleanor! Oh, well, if you guys are celebrating, I recommend the jalapeno poppers.
Hi, there, I'm Janet.
I'll be taking care of you tonight.
Why don't you just go get us a round of beers? Of course.
Here you go.
Sorry.
I will go physically pick those up, I guess, and then walk them back here with my feet.
But just so you know, I will be here all night watching everything that you order.
So, Ellie, baby, brainstorm.
We should get a house.
Me, you, Tahani, Jason we should all go in together on a place.
I think it would be supes fun.
We could play pranks on each other for my vlog.
No.
We could do one of those ice bucket challenges - that I sent you.
- I don't think so.
Or maybe just a Harlem shake? I like to cook, - and I have been dying to - Please stop.
- Experiment with Jamaican food, man.
- Please stop now.
That's a Jamaican accent.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Hey, how's it going? - Not good, Michael.
I don't have my powers.
I can't summon things.
Dictionary.
Spaghetti.
Jet Ski.
Humans only live 80 years, and they spend so much of it just waiting for things to be over.
I'm all out of sorts down here too.
I'm bad at lying now.
That used to be my thing.
And every part of my body is either too dry or too wet.
It's worse for me, man.
Ever since we walked through that portal, my knowledge has stopped updating.
The instant before we left, a man in Caracas, Venezuela, named Raul Benitez was eating a ham sandwich.
Janet, focus on the mission! We have to get Trevor away from the humans.
I am so glad you came out with us, man.
I just assumed you would think it's unprofessional to be friends with the subjects of your study.
No, I never thought that.
I mean, I-I kind of do now.
Should I not be socializing? I'm sure it's fine.
I mean, how much harm could it possibly do? Good point.
Such a good point that I'm gonna go think about how good a point that is over there by myself for several minutes.
Okay, everybody, here are your beers.
And here is yours.
Oh, no, oh.
I guess you should go to the bathroom or maybe go home and never come back.
No worries, I made extra sweatshirts.
Besides, we're having too much fun to leave.
Hey, speaking of fun, I know this super fun drinking game we can play.
Every time one of you says something that the other can't relate to, you both drink.
Do I have to drink for every word I don't know? Up to you.
Just drink.
Hey, what happened with Chidi, and where's Eleanor? This this is all moving too fast.
Can we just take Trevor out? I don't know if he can die, but I could drop a steamroller on his head.
Oh, darn it, I can't summon things.
I guess I could kick him with my soft feet.
Earth sucks.
You stay on Trevor, keep interfering with his plan.
- Yay! You gotta relax, man.
You're off the clock.
It's just a simple drink with friends - at the world's worst restaurant.
- No, but Trevor's right.
I might skew the study by fraternizing with the subjects.
We can be colleagues.
Associates is pushing it.
And by even having this conversation, you're becoming my confidante.
Kind of thought that before everyone else showed up, you and I were, like, becoming actual friends.
Oh, no.
You're right.
What have I done? Okay, okay, I-I-I'm gonna go to the bar and get you a hot tea.
- Okay.
- Or a regular temperature Xanax.
Try not to fall apart.
Professor Anagonye? Oh, yeah, I thought I recognized you.
Uh, I was just kind of in the middle of something here.
Well, maybe I can help.
You know what I like to do in situations like these? I haven't told you anything about what I'm going through.
Do that first, then I'll tell you what I do in situations such as the one you're about to describe.
I've been in every situation because I'm a librarian.
Hit me.
Go ahead.
Mm.
Does anybody want a gallon of water to sober up? No thanks, sweetheart.
I just called a car for these two lovebirds, so why don't you just bring us the check? Oh, and you should smile more.
You'll get bigger tips.
Gosh, you're pretty.
No, you're pretty.
Pretty beautiful.
If you ask me, Chidi, you need to get back over there, you know, spend time with the team.
Though, we do have a saying in the library game.
Got to go now.
The closest thing I could find to herbal tea was a root beer I had them throw in the microwave.
You know what? Don't drink that.
I think I'm just gonna head home.
But you can go and spend time with the others.
Yeah, man, that's not really what I signed up for.
I mean, Tahani is eh, but Jason, woof, and Trevor, blegh.
They're not the reason I flew all the way from Arizona.
I'll, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, E dog, get over here! It's trivia night! The first round questions are all about Logan Paul, and you know I'm Logang for life.
Go put your head up your own butt.
- What? - What? What? Oh, don't you buttnecks ever give up? No, and what are you even doing in a bathroom? You're a demon.
You don't need it.
I like the smells.
And I like putting my hands in the toilet so everything I touch gets a little bit of poop on it.
Hey, you guys see what I did out there? I am so good, I got Eleanor to leave a bar early.
If they hook up, she's on the first private jet out of here.
This was too easy.
It's gonna take a lot more than that to break up this group.
Why don't you give up, Trevor? As long as we're here, you'll never succeed.
Maybe, but how long will that take? I mean, at some point, the judge will find out that you're not in your little room watching ticker tape.
Right? Tick, tick, tick, tick.
But, hey, may the worst demon win.
Good luck, Mikey.
I got a solid eight minutes, not consecutively, but still.
It's fine.
You're not even that blurry.
You gotta take it easy, man.
I mean, you're not sleeping.
Your eye's twitching.
This study has to be airtight.
And this ethical question of friendship with the subjects is weighing on me.
I don't want to come anywhere near those lines.
I have been waiting my entire career for the right thesis, and I am not going to blow it.
I have to keep this professional.
Fine, but you need to get some rest.
This morning, you bit into a raw egg like it was an apple.
I thought it was hard-boiled.
Yeah, but still, the shell.
This is the best secret-friend handshake, bro.
Oh, I don't don't know what to do.
I am both overhung and humiliated by my uncouth comportment last night.
Please accept these formal letters of apology.
Further apologies for their appearance.
I just couldn't find a proper calligrapher at 5:00 in the morning.
So, what happened to you two lovebirds last night, huh? Frankly, it is none of your business.
Oh, sorry.
Jason was a perfect gentleman last night.
You weren't boring.
You were fun.
Crazy story after you got into the cab, I forgot where I lived, but then I looked across the street, and there was a motel, and behind that, there was a dumpster.
I slept in a dumpster.
- Jason.
- No, no, no, it was fine.
And it was super fun getting to know you.
You're the fanciest person I know, next to my friend Ronnie, who drives a limo.
All right, as soon as Eleanor gets here, we'll begin.
Bad news, prof.
Eleanor might not be coming.
She bailed right after you did last night.
Seemed like she was having second thoughts about being part of the Brainy Bunch, so.
Oh, well, that's disappointing in in in terms of how it affects the study.
But we press on, like professionals.
Hey, do you think I should Yeah, and I already called you a car, because you should not drive.
Where's outside? Hey, man.
Are you okay? Sorry, uh, literally one second ago, I was at the front desk.
I don't know where I got this.
Anyway, are you coming to class? Uh I just don't think the group thing is for me.
I'm better when it's one-on-one and we're both looking at our phones and I don't know the other person and we don't talk.
I might just head back to Arizona.
Listen.
My whole life has been a-a torture chamber of indecision, and now I'm finally on the path to understanding why, and the only reason that's happening is because you walked into my office, and you said you wanted to be a better person.
See, I just told you I don't like talking.
That whole thing could have been sent in a text that I pretended I never saw.
Fine, you did good at talking.
I'll come back to class.
Come in.
No? - I'm gonna drive you back.
- Okay.
Hey, Dick Tracy called.
Yeah, that doesn't matter.
We won.
That's the point.
You won squat.
We're gonna get 'em eventually.
I'll just keep chipping away till one of 'em bails.
These four humans are all I care about in the universe, and there is nothing I mean nothing that's gonna come between me Oh, cool, you're all together.
The judge wants to see you.
Michael, how many times did I say you could go down to Earth? Actually, you weren't 100% explicit.
One time.
I said you could go down there, save their lives, start the new timeline, and then come back here to observe them.
One time! Is what I said.
Uno.
One.
Your Honor, I have to say, I support you one-hundo percent.
I mean, what Michael did is unbelievable.
Do you know how much weird stuff has happened because of your little experiment? England left Europe.
That Hugh Jackman musical about P.
T.
Barnum? It made, like, $400 million.
Also, the Jacksonville Jaguars are good now.
Impossible.
I'm serious.
They're gonna make the playoffs.
It's being debated amongst experts.
It's confusing.
But whatever it is, it's your fault! Your experiment with the humans is over.
Are you gonna kill them? No! But starting now, there is no more monitoring them.
They're just regular humans that need to hit the regular point threshold to see if they make it into the Good Place.
- Hmm.
- And if they don't And right now, the two of you are going back to the Bad Place.
But they'll retire Michael, and I'll be marbleized.
Is is that bad? I don't know, but it's weird, man.
Now come with me.
Hey, my powers are back online.
This must be everything I tried to summon on Earth.
- Stop it.
- I don't think I can.
I'm like a printer when the print queue suddenly starts processing all the unprinted documents.
Oh, man.
Janet, make it stop! Janet, stop it.
Janet, this is annoying.
Janet.
Good luck, frog man.
Pulling for ya.
Janet, I know you're still there! Ugh, oh.
They escaped.
Yeah, thanks, Jeff.
Oh! Okay, good news.
I have The Doorman's key, so no one will be able to come after us.
- Let's just try to - [telephone ringing noise] [ringing] Your key is ringing.
[electrical warbling] I have a question for you.
Are you out of your damn mind? Your Honor, look at it from my point of view.
I have never been this angry in my life, which is the age of the universe! I understand, but saving the souls of these four humans is more important, so we're not coming back until we do.
Oh, don't you even try coming back here, because when you walk through that door, I am gonna be waiting for you.
Sorry, Judge, I think you're breaking up.
What are you doing? I can see you.
- [door shuts] - This is perfect.
We're right near Chidi's office, and as far as I can tell, the whole floor is abandoned.
What do they use it for? Storage? No, this is the journalism department.
Huh, bad for the world, good for us.
So somehow, with none of our powers, we have to keep the group intact and monitor their ethical progress.
[jaunty music] - So how how do we do that? - Not sure.
There's no way to track people's actual point totals.
- Let's get peeping! - Oh! Oh, no.
Not a great start.
Eleanor farted, and then she blamed it on her chair.
That's gonna cost her at least a few points.
There's a bolt missing, or something.
Before we begin, Trevor is dropping out of the study.
He sent me an email last night.
"I'm sad to inform you that I am too ugly and stupid to be in the study and I'm going home to my mommy.
It's too bad, but we press on.
We're on to Stage Two of the study.
I'm going to teach you some philosophical principles, and then, we will explore how those ideas have affected your personal moral machineries.
[soft fart] Sorry, Eleanor, did you say something? No, it's my chair.
It's got this weird design.
- Your chair smells bad.
- I know.
See, another person who agrees it's the chair.
- Oh! And you blew it all on cupcakes? Exactly what I would have done.
Respect.
- Eleanor? - Uh, I'm good.
I try to avoid pointless group activities, you know? Like office Christmas parties or jury duty.
To me, the single most awful sound in the universe is that mangled opening note of your co-worker singing "Happy Birthday.
" Cool stance.
Counterpoint: these are delicious, free cupcakes.
- Get over yourself and eat one.
Everyone, get in, get in, and say, uh oh, say "ventromedial pre-frontal cortex.
" [all stammering] Ventromedial pre-frontal Jaguars rule! [soft dramatic music] Hey, teach, I've been having so much fun here, but I didn't plan to stay in Australia this long, and I'm super broke.
Any idea where I can get a part-time gig? What kind of work are you looking for? Well, I'm really good at telemarketing.
I can usually guess how long to microwave food without looking at the box.
I'd say those are my two main skills.
- Okay.
- Dang it.
I'll see what I can do.
No, no, no.
It's it's not cheating.
Think of us as a snowplow, clearing a path for Eleanor so she can more easily drive along the road of improvement.
Ooh, I love that.
You really painted a picture there.
G'day.
How can I help you? One scratch-off lottery ticket, please.
Oh, not that one.
These tickets were printed before we got down here.
I know which ones are the winners.
And stop, that's the one.
Good old lucky number 186 from the bottom.
Here you go.
Also, that bathroom key that you lost nine months ago slid under the register, and the woman that you think is your aunt is actually your mom.
Okay, bye.
You guys, this is nuts.
[pop] Jason? Are you okay there, mate? No.
I have to watch the Jaguars games alone on my computer at like, 3:00 in the morning on Mondays.
It's so annoying.
Everything here is in a I don't know how to describe it.
Like, a different zone of time.
No, that sounds stupid.
A different clock land.
I'll watch the game with you, Jason.
But he wasn't my type, so I set him up with my friend, Gisele Bundchen.
Yeah, we got it.
We always get it.
Awesome, but if you want to watch with me, you have to learn my Jaguars cheer.
It goes: "Let's go Jags.
Kick their ass, yeah!" Do you think you could learn that by the weekend? - I shall do my best.
- Nice, see you then.
Why do you want to watch football with Jason? I don't, really, but I am, these days, as you might say in America, mad horny.
Well, no judgments, babe.
He's a straight hottie.
You want to smash Jason, go smash.
Tahani getting together with Jason, even casually, could tear this group apart.
We have to nip this in the bud.
Well, it makes me slightly uneasy to interfere in the personal life of the man that I'm secretly in love with, and a woman I admire, but if you think we should, I I'm not going to argue.
Time to break out the old snowplow again, Janet.
Let's find Tahani a loving, supportive companion.
Help them work faster.
If I'm going to the mall anyway, I might as well pick Jason up some jean shorts.
The kind with the frayed edges where you can see the pockets coming out of the bottom.
So that he can study better.
Sure.
[soft whimsical music] [indistinct chatter] Tahani, is that you? Larry Hemsworth? My goodness.
That's so funny, I just got a call from the restaurant about a jacket I left here, and now, here you are.
[both laugh] I can't believe you remember me.
I know, I just never expect anyone to remember me.
Because I'm only 6'4" and I have one of those forgettable faces.
Well, uh, I'm sure you're busy.
Probably don't want to talk to me.
I get it, I wouldn't either.
I'm as dull as a rock.
Ugh, even that analogy was boring.
I'm sorry, I'm so dull, and I'm ugly.
It's lovely to see you.
Sit down, let's catch up.
How are Chris and Liam and Luke? - [sighs] - Sorry, no, I won't mention your brothers again.
As long as you don't mention my sister.
Oh! [both laugh] Mmm-mm.
Who are you? Do you work here? Your name is Montgomery Wycoff.
Your ex-wife, Samantha, still loves you, but she's afraid to call.
You must show her your poetry.
- I did.
- You and Jason.
Imagine that.
To be fair, I have.
Actually, I was with an ex-boyfriend.
I ran into him unexpectedly.
The reunion was a smash-ing success.
It was a pun, you see.
- I do feel bad, though.
I completely forgot about watching the game with Jason.
Homies, guess what? Yesterday, I got a Facebook invite to the Australia chapter of the Jacksonville Jaguars fan club! Yeah, I think he's over it.
Me and two other dudes just watched the Jags annihilate the Texans! It was super fun! I'm completely wasted.
I got to go barf one last time, and then I'll be ready to learn philosophy! Dude! [yells] Okay, not perfect, but the pros outweigh the cons.
Agreed.
[soft whimsical music] [together] Happy birthday dear Chidi You guys, this whole year has been amazing for all of us.
I mean, literally every aspect of our lives has improved.
I have your lesson plan ready to go.
SuperBoard, some triumphant announcement music, please.
[triumphant announcement music] Last night, Larry Hemsworth proposed to me, and we're moving back to London to begin planning the wedding.
- Whoa! - Holy smokes! Janet, red alert.
All snowplowing has to stop immediately.
So don't give Blake Bear-tles to Jason? How are you even lugging this thing around? I'm not sure I could bench this much weight.
Well, girls in my social class begin ring training at a very young age.
Oh, I'm throwing a little engagement party tonight at my AirBnB.
[elegant string music] I guess all these people came as they were? Hello, everyone.
I'm so glad you made it.
Holy crap, Tahani.
You found this place on AirBnB? Oh, no.
I see why you're confused.
I used "HeirBnB.
" H-E-I-R.
It's an app for heirs and heiresses where we swap mansions, private islands, blimp hangars, that sort of thing.
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to build up the courage to meet you.
I guess you can see why.
Is he ashamed at having a perfect jaw line, and 0% body fat? Still can't believe she wants to marry me.
A dumb old pediatric surgeon who barely has an 8-pack.
Do you know what you look like? More importantly, did Miley Cyrus write the song "Wrecking Ball" about Chris's brother, Liam? Wonderful.
More questions about my talented brothers.
God forbid there's a single day when I'm the special one.
No, sweetheart, don't go.
Maybe we should just let them go their separate ways, and hope that they learned enough to get into the Good Place.
No, we know what'll happen.
The group splits up, they're screwed, no.
We have to isolate Larry, and convince him that he needs to stay in Australia.
Time to get into character as [Australian accent] Nathaniel Cookswell, mate.
- Caterer to the stars! - Ah.
Maybe no accent.
[normal voice] Fine.
I'll always be the chubby one.
[Australian accent] Good day, mate! Nathaniel Cookswell.
- Caterer to the stars.
- Mm.
Is it true you're moving to England? - Yeah, I fly out tomorrow.
- Oh, ooh, that's a long trip.
Boy, you must be a confident man.
Uprooting your life like that.
8% of.
Probably.
I reckon I know what's going on here.
You aren't real caterers, are you? - Uh uh uh - [exhaling] Who do you work for? "Australian Inquirer"? TM-Zed? You just want us to stay here so you can keep mocking me.
The hideous shame of the Hemsworth family.
- Oh.
- Tahani sees through all that.
And I can't wait until we move far away from the likes of you, and I can finally take her last name.
Do you think Margot Robbie is into philosophy? Actually, Tahani's announcement made us take stock.
You know, Simone and I need time to analyze the data, apply for grants.
We've kind of hit a natural stopping point.
Yeah, and the next step would be to repeat the experiment with new subjects, you know, compare results.
Wait, what are you saying? That the study's over? We're splitting up? No, no, no, we're just taking a break, for a year or so.
And I'm sure you're all anxious to get back home.
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff to get back to in Phoenix.
Like I have a free punch card at my spray tan place.
Okay, new emergency plan.
I'll deal with Eleanor.
I I know it's risky, but I don't think she'll recognize me.
And I'll deal with Sweet Cheeks I mean, Jason's butt I mean, Jason.
[scoffs] [suspenseful music] - Shrimp? - Always.
So how do you know Miss Al-Jamil? You work with her at the university? Used to.
That study is done-zo.
I was finally starting to figure things out, and now, I have to start over from scratch, again.
The point is, I bet that if the study means that much to you, it means a lot to everyone else.
You're all just probably waiting for someone to say it out loud.
You want some cocktail sauce with that? [clinking glass] I would like to acknowledge the wonderful group of people who brought me here.
If I hadn't decided to get out of the spotlight of my "Get Out of the Spotlight" tour, and come here, and joined the Brainy Bunch, I never would have reconnected with Larry.
[crowd aww's] So, to celebrate our group, I had my favorite patissier whip this up.
[soft giggle] Would any of you like to say a few words? Eleanor! - [crowd applauds] - Yay, Eleanor.
If nobody minds.
Uh, I would like to address the people on this cake, I suppose.
Jason and I are straight trash.
[caws] But just, I mean, think about how much progress we've all made since that picture was taken.
I know that what we're doing is important, and I'm not ready to stop.
And I don't think you guys are, either.
So let's all stay here and keep it going.
What do you say? Eleanor, that was absolutely lovely.
It really was, and I'm I'm so glad that this study meant that much to you.
- But, realistically - That's cool, I get it.
- That's all she wrote, cool.
- Are you okay? - I hope you're not mad.
- No, I'm not mad.
I'm actually laughing, because this whole study was a hilarious, stupid, pointless joke, and now it's over, so let's hit the road.
I don't need you guys.
You don't need me.
And since you don't need me, I'm just going to take the "me" out of this cake.
- No, no.
Farewell to you, my liege.
And a jolly good Saint Ploopington's Day to all of you.
[normal voice] USA! USA! USA! [soft whimsical music] Eleanor? Is that you? No.
I called a cab like, 20 minutes ago.
It says it's ten kilometers away, which is I don't even know how far.
It's a little over six miles.
Is that why you came out here? To scold me about the metric system? No, I was about to call a cab myself.
I have an early class tomorrow.
Wait, wait, wait-wait-wait.
- Wait-wait, I'm sorry.
- [bottle clanks] I'm sorry.
Don't go.
You're a brain scientist.
Can you tell me why I did that in there? I mostly do clinical research in neuroscience.
I don't really specialize in temper tantrums.
Maybe you need a child psychologist.
I deserved it, I did.
But please, can you help me? Why did I do that? Okay, here's my guess.
As humans evolved, the first big problem we had to overcome was "me versus us.
" Learning to sacrifice a little individual freedom for the benefit of a group.
You know, like sharing food and resources so we don't starve or get eaten by tigers, things like that.
Okay, with you so far.
The next problem to overcome was "us versus them," trying to see other groups different from ours as equals.
That one, we're still struggling with.
Point made.
Keep going.
Well, what's interesting about you is I don't think you ever got past the "me versus us" stage.
I mean, have you ever been part of a group that you really cared about? - I was in the Girl Scouts.
- Really? Technically, I joined under a fake name because I wanted to steal a bunch of cookies.
See, the Brainy Bunch is basically the first group that became part of your self-identity.
And now that's breaking up, you're feeling this new kind of loss, and you're scared of going back to being alone.
I mean, that's just my guess.
And thank you.
[exhales] The point is, I'm not really an "I'm sorry" type girl.
I'm more of a "it's your fault your car got keyed "in the movie theatre parking lot because you wouldn't shut up while watching 'John Wick'" type girl.
But I'm sorry that I freaked out.
I'm just really going to miss you guys.
- We're going to miss you, too.
- Here's an idea.
What if we all agree to a yearly reunion? And then that way, the Brainy Bunch never dies.
My house is right on the water.
It didn't used to be, but the whole city is a swamp, and it's sinking into the ocean.
Whoo, strong pitch, bud.
Next year in Jacksonville.
Yeah.
Uh, we might not want to wait a whole year.
It's sinking really fast.
- We should have a toast.
Let's go.
- [torch clicks, whooshes] Michael, no.
We can't keep meddling forever.
It's time to park the snowplow and trust that the humans will make progress on their own.
This isn't like your afterlife neighborhood, Michael.
You can't just reset things the moment something doesn't go according to your plan.
Oh, Janet.
You're a genius.
You just gave me this crazy idea.
It's so crazy, it just might fail.
It'll probably fail, but it also might work.
I open the door to the afterlife.
You keep a lookout, while I break into the Judge's chamber, and reset the timeline on Earth.
And we do it all over again, but correctly.
We won't wait a year to get them all together again.
We'll get the study going right away.
- Michael, before you do this - No, no more waiting! This is all we have, Janet! We have Chidi and Eleanor and Tahani and Jason, and that is it.
If we can't get them enough afterlife points to get them into the Good Place, then there's no point in us even being here.
We have to try.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Okay.
[electrical warbling] What the hell is that? Oh.
[chuckles] Hey guys.
[door slams] What door? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on? Who are you, and why were you talking about us? What's the Good Place? And what are afterlife points? And who has the most? And is it me? Wait a second, I know this guy.
You're Zach Pizzazz.
He got me here from Jacksonville.
No, this is the librarian from the university.
Well, I know him as Gordon Indigo, a very rude Silicon Valley investor.
All right, guys.
I can explain everything.
Yo! Buddy, you have, like, three seconds to explain this crazy space door, or Chidi here is gonna beat you up.
Oh, no, I'm I'm not.
But I would like to know about the space door.
All right, I don't know what choice we have.
I'll tell you the truth.
My name is Special Agent Rick Justice, and this is Lisa Frenchy-Fuqua.
We're with the FBI.
And all of you are in grave danger.
We're here to protect you from demons.
No, wait, that's real.
Uh, ghouls, ghouls We're here to protect you from ghouls.
Now, I had to appear in different disguises to keep tabs on you.
But you are all involved together in this FBI case.
- [snorts] - No, we we can prove this.
We have detailed files on all of you.
Ask Janet anything.
I thought her nickname was Frenchy.
It is.
That's why they call her, - Lisa "Double Nickname" Fuqua.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Guys, I used to work at a place that was raided by the FBI pretty frequently.
I know a Fed when I see one.
And these two jamokes are not FBI, okay? Who are you really? All right, all right, fine.
- Serious question - Yeah.
- Should we kill them? - What? It might work! We kill them, go back through the door, somehow grab them before they get to the Bad Place, and regroup from there.
I could kill them right now.
You know, it would be easy.
Their bodies are very poorly made.
They're mostly goo and juice.
You just take the juice out, and then they're dead.
Michael, they've seen through the door into the afterlife, and they heard how it works.
Fine.
I guess I'll start at the beginning.
You all died.
Well, this sucks.
So, to sum up there is a heaven and hell.
We've been to hell, and now, no matter how good we are, for the rest of our lives, we're going back to hell? Again, it's not the classic Christian hell, but that's the gist, yes.
As soon as you learned about the afterlife, your motivation to be good was corrupted.
So you can't earn points anymore.
So all the attempts you made to torture us we must have been in the afterlife for 100 years.
Almost 300, actually.
Well, how is it possible that all these things happened to us but no time passed on Earth? Did you go back in time to save us? Uh, I didn't have to because of Jeremy Bearimy.
Who's Jeremy Bearimy? Okay.
Things in the afterlife don't happen while things are happening here, because while time on Earth moves in a straight line one thing happens, then the next, then the next time in the afterlife moves in a "Jeremy Bearimy.
" What? In the afterlife, time doubles back and loops around and ends up looking something like "Jeremy Bearimy.
" This is the timeline in the afterlife.
Happens to kind of look like the name "Jeremy Bearimy" in cursive English, so that's what we call it.
How can events happen before the ones that happened before? It's just the way it works.
It's it's Jeremy Bearimy.
I don't know what to tell you.
That's the easiest way to describe it.
Okay, but, um what the hell is this? The dot over the I what the hell is that? Okay, um, how do I explain this concisely? This is Tuesdays and also July.
- And sometimes it's never.
- That's true.
Occasionally that moment on the Bearimy timeline is the time-moment when nothing never occurs.
I'm I'm done.
You know what? I'm glad this whole thing happened, because now I can go back to living my life the way I used to only caring about myself because being good is pointless.
No, no.
Please, Eleanor No, thank you.
I'm outtie.
See you in hell.
[gasps] You know what I just realized? I always say that when leaving a room, but right now it's accurate.
I will literally see all of you in hell.
No, no look, look, you guys, this is not over.
We have to stay together! Look, we'll figure something out! Like, just one idea I had I could kill all of you.
That's my birthday.
Hey, buddy.
[clears throat] It's my birthday.
One free margarita, please.
Happy birthday! Can I just see some I.
D.
I just want a free margarita.
Well, if I just randomly gave you a free drink, I'd have to do it for everyone.
Pretty soon I'd go out of business.
[laughs] Then don't do it for everyone.
Just do it for me because it's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
[indistinct chatter] Jason, I have an idea.
But it's a little risky.
Well, technically, it was just a bunch of kiddie pools full of jellyfish, and instead of a killer whale, they killed a whale.
Excuse me, miss.
we'd like to buy one opera, please.
Uh, what he means is I would like to give $2 million to the Sydney Opera.
Ms.
Al-Jamil, this is so generous.
With a donation of that size, we will dedicate a rehearsal hall in your honor.
Thank you, but, no.
I'll draw up the papers.
Why don't you want your name on the opera house? I love getting my name on stuff.
In Jacksonville, I got a flu virus named after me 'cause I kissed a bat on a dare.
Well, I was thinking about why I was sent to hell, as one is wont to do when one has recently been told that one had been sent to hell, and it occurred to me, I have always been held captive by my desire for attention.
Now that I know how it all ends, I just want to be virtuous for virtue's sake.
That's beautiful.
I got to say, though, if you want to do more charity, I know a way that could be a lot of fun.
[chuckles] [gentle music] Hey, you want to talk to God? "God is dead.
I was just trying to sell you some drugs, and you made it weird! [sprinklers hissing] I've never written a manifesto before.
What are you gonna say? It will be a complete account of everything we've learned.
from the beginning of my neighborhood to right now and then a recommendation of how we feel the afterlife could be improved.
When we turn ourselves in, we'll give it to the judge.
Hopefully she'll read it.
We failed, Janet.
But maybe one day, someone else will succeed.
Okay.
- Well - Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.
Wait, I see it, I see it! - [seethes] - [laughing] Look what I did! - Yeah.
- I wrote, "Micahel"! [laughing] Oh, that's Okay.
Back, back, back, back, back.
Maybe you should dictate, and I should type.
[keys clacking rapidly] Good call.
Just laying out some early details.
Go ahead and start dictating.
Ugh, fine.
Here are my rules.
Rule number one I get to do whatever I want, and you all just have to deal with it.
Rule two no more Spider-Man movies.
There's way too many Spider-Man movies! Too many dorky little twerpy Spider-Men.
[slurps] Rule three everyone leave me alone.
So you just take care of yourself.
You don't owe anything to anyone else? [scoffs] If people lived that way, society would break down.
It's terrible, and it's great.
You only look out for number one, scream at whoever disagrees with you.
There are no bees because they all died, and if you need surgery, you just beg for money on the Internet.
It's a perfect system.
Now get me another drink.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Well, well, well a wallet.
[inhales deeply] My rules say I get to take the cash out and keep it, because in my society, I do whatever I want, 'cause I'm awesome.
Just Ugh! All right, this is the address on the license.
That'll be 58 bucks.
Keep the meter running as soon as I'm done here, I'm gonna head to the airport and get the hell out of this trash country, where everyone is either a criminal or a spider.
Hello, ma'am.
Is there a Fred Booth here? I found his wallet, and now I'm doing a nice thing and returning it because I suck.
Sorry, he moved.
I can give you his new address if you'd like.
Actually, I have some of his mail.
Anything else you want me to schlep over? Well, this awesome day gets awesomer.
Before the airport, we're heading to 78 Palmer Street.
Ha! That's right next to the bar where I picked you up! I feel like a bloody boomerang! - [laughing] - Of course you do! [laughs mockingly] [pensive music] - Uh - Hello.
Sir, you, uh, can't shop here without a shirt.
Oh Sir, that'll be $880.
Here's my credit card.
Why don't you just charge it and keep it forever? And also, here's the keys to my car.
Wait.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you like some free money? Now you can buy fingers for your gloves! Hello, madam.
Are you poor? Here's $5,000 for a new stroller.
Have a nice day! You don't have to say the "are you poor?" part.
Right.
- Hello, here's some money.
- Here you go! - Hello.
- Here you go.
Man, there's so many times that just this amount of money would have changed my life.
I could have paid my rent.
I could have gone to a real doctor, instead of pretending I was a big dog so I could go to the vet.
You know, that gives me an idea which I suppose one could argue means that anything could have given me an idea.
Come with me! I'm sorry, Ms.
Al-Jamil, but I just don't feel comfortable processing this request.
- Why not? - Well, it just seems a bit odd to transfer the totality of your account 131 million British pounds to the account of this person a man who is so flagrantly ignoring the "one lollipop per customer" rule.
No, I walked out and back in each time, so I'm different customers.
I don't want the money.
My friend Jason does.
I would like to give it to him.
If it's easier, you can just put it on a Game Stop gift card.
That does not make it easier.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
G'day Fred, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
- And your wallet.
Oh, my goodness! Thank you so much! It was nothing.
Dude, I didn't take your money.
I would never even think of doing that.
No, no, no.
I'm not worried about that.
Ah.
Here it is.
Ah, it's my good-luck charm.
Every time I'm stressed at work now, I just have to look at this, and I feel safe.
A lot of people wouldn't have tried so hard to get this to me.
You are a good person, Eleanor.
I really hope my daughter turns out like you when she grows up.
[chuckles] - Are you all right? - [sniffles] No, you shut up! [cries] Sorry, it's been a weird day.
You put the Peeps in the chili pot And eat them both up You put the Peeps in the chili pot And add the M&Ms You put the Peeps in the chili pot And it makes it taste bad [clears throat] I'm gonna eat all this chili and/or die trying.
Anyone want any? I'm just gonna put it right down here.
Scoop your little mittens right in the stew.
Professor, I can see that you're going through something, but exams are next week, so can you teach us anything? All right, nerd.
You want to learn something? I'll teach you something.
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of life.
How do you like them apples? Now, over the last 2,500 years, Western philosophers have formed three main theories on how to live an ethical life.
Now, first off, there's virtue ethics.
Aristotle believed that there were certain virtues of mind and character, like courage or generosity, and you should try to develop yourself in accordance with those virtues.
The gift will be anonymous.
How much utility, or good, did it accomplish versus how much pain, or bad.
And finally, there's deontology, the school of thought that there are strict rules and duties that everyone must adhere to in a functioning society.
Being ethical is simply identifying and obeying those duties and following those rules.
But here's the thing, my little chili babies, all three of those theories are hot, stinky cat dookie.
The true meaning of life, the actual ethical system that you should all follow is nihilism.
The world is empty.
There is no point to anything, and you're just gonna die.
So do whatever.
And, no.
And you all get As or Fs.
And there is no test.
And you all failed it, and you all got As.
Who cares? Good-bye.
- [students murmuring] - Good-byyyyye.
Cool lecture.
And cooler shirt.
I do have a stomachache.
Why do I always have a stomachache? Well, you just ate 50 pounds of chili, bro.
This one's on you.
Look, I know the future seems bleak.
But I have a plan.
Come with me.
No, ah, ah, leave that chili, weirdo.
A complete account of every single thing we've done and learned.
And I added a pretty tasty little recipe for cinnamon rolls made out of pizza dough.
- [chuckles] - Ha! Maybe someone someday can learn from our mistakes.
And enact real change in the process of judging people.
But for now, Janet, old friend, we are going to enjoy our time on Earth before we're retired.
- Hmm.
- So let's get started.
I know it's touristy, but I'd really like to visit a LensCrafters.
Ooh, and I'd like to get bangs.
Um is everything okay other than, you know, everything? We've started to accept our fates.
It's all chili under the bridge.
Oh! Good, you're all here! Big news everyone BOTH: We got - Tacos! - Married! Oh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got married.
And then after we got married, we got tacos! Wow! Wow, that's crazy! [whimpering] It's strictly platonic, of course.
We only did it so I could legally give Jason half my money.
We just popped over to the British Embassy and signed the papers.
That's insane, but it's also, like the 11th most insane thing to happen today, so who cares? I need everyone to focus up.
But I think we have one move left.
We can try.
Try what? Try to do good.
That stupid, little voice in my head told me to do something good today, and it was so annoying, but it also made a dork and his very untalented daughter super happy.
Me trying just a little bit put some good out into the world.
The six of us are not getting into the Good Place.
But there are still people in this world that we care about, so I say we try and help them be good people.
Try and help them get in.
I'm in.
I'm in, too.
I'm gonna remember this day forever because of your dope speech and also because of the great tacos I had and also because I got married and I found out I was going to hell and also I became a hundred-millionaire All right, we get it.
We get it.
It goes without saying that we're in.
Let's say it anyway.
- We're in - We're All right, you go - We're in - We're in [laughing] We're just so excited! We're in! What do you say, bud? You want to join the Soul Squad? Try to save some souls? - Yeah.
I'm in.
I was just on my way to the MRI lab.
I thought I heard your voice.
Ready to go to the airport? Start our lives together? Go ahead, Tahani, we're rolling.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's do sophomore year high school.
- Nathan Burlingame.
Kylie Mansard.
Thought you were cool but intimidating.
No way.
I thought she was intimidating.
That's why I shoved her into that creek.
Well, after my chili episode, I asked the administration for a one-year sabbatical and, good news, they fired me.
So I am free and easy.
Well, the rest of the Soul Squad is off helping Jason's dad.
If I slip up and tell her about the universe, it could doom her for eternity, and I've avoided talking to her for so long, she assumed I had laryngitis, and it went too far, - and now I'm on antibiotics.
- Okay, settle down.
Your moral code means you can't lie, right? You need to just ghost her.
Disappear.
Block her number.
Bonus, anything she left in your apartment now legally belongs to you.
I've done that to dozens of people, and all of them got over it.
Actually, none of your exes have ever gotten over you.
Bing! I usually appear out of thin air and there would be a pleasant bing sound, but I don't have my powers, so I'm doing my own bings now.
Bing! [laughs] Chidi, what if I could create a virtual reality simulation where you could practice different breakup scenarios? - You can do that? - I think so.
I do know everything about you and Simone and computer programming and virtual reality and artificial intelligence and the human brain and everything else.
I'm kind of a nerd.
I'll start building the simulator now.
Bing! [chuckles] Don't Turn around.
It's embarrassing.
Bing.
" My good friend and yoga pupil Sting, no last initial, told me that.
I can't wait to show you guys all the cool sites in Jacksonville.
Like, that swamp is where me, Pillboi, and Donkey Doug used to stand and try and blind pilots with laser pointers, and Maybe we should do the tour after we, you know, save your father's soul.
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.
Why are you trying to save your father? I've heard you mention your friend Pillboi many times, but you've not mentioned your father once.
What do you mean? I talk about Donkey Doug all the time.
I'm sorry.
The man you call Donkey Doug is your father? Yeah.
Who? So Michael and I have a plan to save my dad.
My whole life, Donkey Doug was always getting in trouble because of some get-rich-quick scheme.
He sold counterfeit truck nuts.
He created a sport that was a cross between dodgeball and horseshoes and everybody died.
- He glued - This should be easy.
We have plenty of money.
If we just give him money, he'll blow it.
He's gotta feel like he did it himself.
Okay, let's go save my dad.
- Taxi! - [whistle blows] [rock music blaring] - Ha! - Need help with your bags? Nah, I got it.
[knock at door] - Oh, damn, Jason! - Oh, dude, Donkey Doug! You call him Donkey Doug in person? Me and Jason are cool like that.
I don't think of him as my son.
I think of him as my boy! I mean, I am your boy.
Yeah, but it's more like, "That's my son right there, son.
" But not like, "Son, son.
" But like, "My boy.
Oh, this is my friend Michael.
Oh, crap.
You look like a cop.
Are you a cop? Because if you are, you have to tell me, and you're not allowed to arrest me for anything you saw before I knew you were a cop.
- I-I'm not a police officer.
- Yeah, Michael's cool.
And this is Tahani, who is my wife, I guess.
Dang, nice pull, son! How about you and me go check out my Jacuzzi and put stuff in each other? Again, I'm his wife.
Welcome to the family! Come on in! This program knows everything about your personality, Simone's personality, and all human relationships.
It can't tell you exactly what will happen, but it will approximate Simone's reaction to anything you say to her.
Plus, it has Tetris.
[laughs] Hmm, would this work with, say, me and, say, Jason Statham and instead of a cafÃ©, it was, say, a room with a futon and a bunch of Red Bull? Why is it that every time a new thing is invented, humans immediately try to use it for porn? - Because we're disgusting.
- Huh.
Eleanor and I will be watching on the monitor.
We'll see what you see.
Put these in your ears.
- Hey, babe.
What did you want to talk about? Go ahead, Chidi, practice what you want to say to her.
Right.
Um Simone, this has been the best year of my life because of you.
Unfortunately, I have come to learn some information, and it means that we have to end this relationship.
- What information? - I - can't say.
- Why not? I-I can't say.
Well, you've either gone crazy, or you're too much of a coward to tell me how you feel.
- No.
No.
No.
Wait [groans] So - that didn't go great.
- I disagree.
I thought it was hilarious.
So, Donkey Doug, Jason told us about your electrician license, and we have a career opportunity for you.
Yo, later for that.
- It explains so much.
- Oh, dip! Pillboi! Jason, I thought you were dead.
But I was alive.
I was in Australia.
I talked to you on the phone last week.
- Yeah, but I forgot.
- Oh.
Me and Pillboi have been cooking up something real special.
Sharks, how much do you spend on energy drinks and body spray in one week? Three hundred dollars? Ten hundred dollars? What if I told you there was a product that combined these two things for one solution to all of life's problems and more? I give to you Double Trouble! The world's first energy drink/body spray.
So do you spray it on yourself, or do you drink it? - You both it.
- This is the one, Jason.
We're gonna be so rich.
I'll finally be able to pay to have my calf implants moved back up from my feet.
This is gonna be a lot tougher than we thought.
Tell me about it.
Double Trouble sounds amazing.
So I just have to be simple, honest, and declarative and somehow still protect her feelings.
I don't know, man.
Maybe just tell her that you're gay.
- I'm not gay.
- Fine, bi.
- I'm not bi either.
- Why not? More guys should be bi.
It's 2018.
Sure, if you want to reset, just snap your fingers.
Also, I made some modifications to the tone, so it should make your transition easier.
Oh.
[easy listening music playing] Mm! Hey, babe.
What did you want to talk about? Well, I don't love you anymore.
- What? - No, no.
You don't understand.
I don't technically love you in the same way because of circumstances.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Because we're all dying slowly, when you think about it.
We start dying the moment we're born.
So not a lie.
[snaps fingers] Okay, here it is.
I'm just gonna be perfectly honest.
My real name is Special Agent Rick Justice, FBI.
Yeah, good call.
- So, Simone - Wait.
Before you say anything, - I think we should break up.
- You do? Yes, I love and respect you very much, but we're heading in different directions.
And don't worry, we don't have to make a big thing of it.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
This is the one.
Coffee's right there.
Oh, one more thing.
Suck it, you doink.
- Sorry? - [laughs] This is Eleanor, you idiot.
Janet let me mess with the simulator to screw with you.
- Janet, come on! - Hi, Chidi.
This is Janet now.
Sorry, it won't happen again.
- [laughs] - [snaps fingers] We need to break up, but here's a puppy.
Aw! Wait, what? He's a puppy, it's over between us, and he's cute.
Do you think I don't hear the bad parts - of these sentences? - His name is Martin, I need my keys back, and he's a puppy.
You are very bad at this.
That's because I don't actually want - to break up with her.
- What, do you need me to break up with her for you like we're in middle school or something? Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Please.
- Fine.
[easy listening music playing] Hey, Eleanor.
Hey.
What did you want to talk about? Well, first of all, you and Chidi are so great together.
He really loves you, and I can see why.
You know, you're brilliant, charming, obviously gorgeous.
- Aw, you're sweet to say that.
What? I don't think I have an accent.
[mimicking Eleanor] I don't think I have an accent.
Stop it! [both laughing] [sighs] What is happening? [laughs] No! No.
This is over.
Whoa, man, come on.
It was just getting good.
Let's remember the mission.
Your father needs to focus on long-term stability.
That one is also a lube.
Look, Donkey Doug, Double Trouble is dope.
On that much, we can all agree on.
But you got to think long-term.
You were good at electricity stuff.
You hooked us up with free porno channels every year ever since the third grade.
It's good, honest work.
Honest work? Whatever, Dad.
When Double Trouble pops off, I'll be able to quit my job at the old folks' home.
Buy a big-ass mansion.
Every day, I'll wake up, get out of bed, brush my teeth, rinse, go downstairs, open the fridge, "Damn, we out of milk," get in my car You don't have to run through the whole imaginary day.
Jason, I believe in Double Trouble.
Why won't you believe in me? Well, I suppose a little entrepreneurial spirit never hurt anyone.
You know, reach for the stars, as I said to my good friend Elon Musk.
And then he shot his car into space.
What a weird creep.
Yeah, it's a factory.
- Excuse me? - Tonight we're gonna steal some energy drinks from an energy drink factory, then still some cologne from a cologne factory.
So it's actually two factories.
Then we just got to bottle it all up.
Ah, dip, we gotta rob a bottle factory.
- Three factories.
- Three factories.
Stupid Donkey Doug.
Will you guys help me? I mean, yeah, that that's why we're here, Jason.
What's your idea, darling? We're gonna save Pillboi.
[Chidi] Okay, real life.
I think I'm ready.
I've analyzed the ten most successful scenarios and compiled the statistically most effective breakup strategy.
Who said you weren't a romantic? Every girlfriend I've ever had.
Ooh, there she is.
Okay.
Uh - Is something wrong? No, it's just that we're usually over there.
Doesn't matter.
Okay, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything that's happened in the last year Hi there, what can I get you to drink? I'll have an iced tea, please.
- Mm-hmm.
- Water, thanks.
It's been a time of massive personal and professional growth Sorry, sugar with that iced tea? - Yes, please.
- Right.
All in all, it's been overwhelmingly positive, and I think that's due in large part to you Sorry, real quick, I'm gonna go on break, so Helmut will be taking care of you.
Yeah, okay.
One.
That was one second.
[laughs] That was a joke.
Please get out of here, Helmut! - Okay, yeah.
- All right, look, just we need to break up.
I am I am breaking up with you.
- Why? - I can't it's it's complicated, but it's happening.
- Wait.
Wait, no.
Come back, please.
- Yeah, okay! I'm back.
- Not you, Helmut.
Hey, now, listen, Judy, you can't mix xannys with these little pink fools.
You'll be tripping balls like Clarence was when he crawled into the ice machine.
- [laughs] - Here.
[laughs] Thanks, Pillboi.
Yo, I gotta take off 'cause I gotta go do a robbery.
I mean I'm sick.
Hello, Pillboi.
I'm here on behalf of Jason.
You won't be attending the job with Donkey Doug today.
There's been a change of plans.
Okay.
Want some pills? I hate this.
What if I ruined her? What if I sent her down the wrong path and she ends up in the Bad Place? I have to undo what I did.
Janet, fire up the simulator.
Dude, no more simulations.
Just talk to her.
Breakups never end with both people feeling great.
But she's a badass, and her world is bigger than your relationship.
She'll recover.
Right.
Here I go.
Janet, can I use the simulator? There's a very specific Lenny Kravitz concert - I want to be front row at.
- Sure.
FYI, when the system boots up, you might find yourself in a steam room with Jason, who will be wearing an old-timey strongman onesie.
It's a bug in the system.
Pillboi? No, it's me, Pillboi's friend Jason.
Pillboi's not coming.
I'm trying to save him.
Oh, dip.
You got religious and shiz? - Amen.
- Amen.
Okay, hurry up and get this crap in my truck.
[siren wailing] Jacksonville Police! Come out with your hands up! Are you a cop? 'Cause if you are, you have to tell us.
Yes, this is the police.
Yup, I knew it.
No.
I know I haven't been the best father in the world.
I might not have even been in the top five.
I wanna make up for that.
I'll distract 'em.
You run out the back.
No, that's crazy.
It's what my dad did for me and his dad for him.
Hey - call me Donkey Dad.
- Okay.
Donkey Dad.
Nah, that sounds wack.
Call me Donkey Doug.
Cool.
Bortles! Uh Here's the truth.
You're amazing.
I really, really do, but I can't.
Well you seem to know what you want, which is rare for you.
Well, I hope you keep the study going.
Might help a lot of people.
[sighs] Well see you in the next life.
What? Why would you say that? What do you know? It's a figure of speech.
You're so weird, man.
I think maybe this is for the best.
You cannot commit any more crimes, and you must help these people as much as you can.
- The mission depends on it.
- Roger that.
Man, I can't believe this whole time, you guys were with NASA.
Yes, we are secret astronaut spies.
That is indeed what Jason told you.
Take good care of these old fools, and stay out of trouble.
I love you, bro.
- I got you, bro.
- I got you, bro.
Jag - uars BOTH: Rule.
[both crying] Well, my sister's museum exhibit opens tomorrow.
Are you all ready for some Al-Jamil family reconciliation? You know it, wifey.
Soul Squad is on a roll.
I pretty much nailed that Pillboi thing, and I got closure with my dad, Donkey Doug.
That remains depressing, but I'm happy for you, bud.
- What are you talking about? - Your mother's alive.
She faked her own death.
I'm sorry, Tahani, I don't think I'll be able to stay with you here in Budapest.
Turns out my mom isn't dead, so I need to fly back to America to murder her.
So my mom is alive, and she lives here.
Why didn't you tell me sooner, man? I had already told you that you died and that I had tortured you for centuries and that you're doomed to be tortured again.
I just didn't want to be, like, a bummer.
But now you know everything important about your life.
That police officer was an actor.
See, about a month before, your mom had gotten drunk, wandered into a charity auction, and bid $30,000 for a date with Gene Simmons, outbidding everyone else by $29,800.
She didn't want to pay, so she faked her death, moved to Nevada, and reinvented herself as Diana Tremaine.
Diana Tremaine is my fake ID name.
- I - [gasps] How dare she steal the identity I stole? Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but we're here to help your mom get into the Good Place.
Whatever you're feeling, remember, this is not about you.
Right.
[knock at door] How could you do this to me? [light music] Yay, you found me.
You haven't even introduced me to this stretched-out, sexy Alex Trebek.
I'm Michael.
It's nice to meet you, Donna.
Oh, uh, it's Diana now for, you know, police reasons.
By the way, whose McMansion is this? My boyfriend Dave's.
He's kind of a dork but real sweet and so fancy.
His napkins are made out of, like, shirt material.
Cloth.
I get it.
You're running a scam.
No, baby, this is as real as the nails under my acrylic nails.
- I'm a different person.
- Spare me.
You will always be sun-baked Arizona trash, - and I know that - [door opens] because I grew up baking right beside you.
Oh, jeez, I didn't know we had company.
- Hey.
Of course you're Dave.
Hey, Dave, you and I need to have a little conversation.
- Diana! - Oh, hey.
Who the hell is this chick? This is my little potato pie, Patricia.
And who might you be, by the way? Eleanor is my sorority sister.
Right.
Good old Kappa Zeta Jones.
- Oh.
Wow.
Is this whole room just her work? Don't be fooled, Chidi.
Kamilah is a charlatan.
All she has to do is paint some dumb shapes, and people go mad.
Those aren't dumb shapes.
They're a pair of boobs.
And then two extra side boobs.
It symbolizes that boobs come in all shapes and sizes and distances apart.
There are plenty of other people I could help, like my good friend Ben Affleck and his crippling addiction to back tattoos, or my other good friend Matt Damon and his crippling addiction to my friend Ben Affleck.
It's important that you make amends.
Your competitive relationship with Kamilah is largely the reason you didn't get into the Good Place.
It stands to reason that the same would be true for her.
Fine.
But the waiting is over.
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Tahani, were you waiting in line to see me? That's hilarious.
So making omelets is art now, is it? Not that I'd expect you to understand, but it's a commentary on the world's fascination with subservience, consumption, death, and pedagogy.
Cheddar or Swiss? Oh, no, I don't want an omelet.
I just came for a quick sisterly chat.
[bell jingles] My sister, Tahani, refuses to order an omelet.
[people gasp, shout] As a result, the exhibit is now over and will never be shown again.
- There will be no refunds.
- [crowd murmuring] [sighs] Hey, now.
I just checked my Apple Watch, and it's marg-o-clock.
Me too.
- Ah.
Dave's real good.
You should see the new Hooters on I-15.
It looks classy, like a bank.
So how did you two love-rats meet? Oh, it's a fun story.
I was working on this project tearing down a condemned bar called the Desert Rash.
I went in to meet with the contractors, and Diana is sitting at the bar drinking a 7 and 7 and 7.
Oh, that's right, it was very early in the morning.
- [chuckles] - Well, this little spitfire finds out it's me who's closing down the bar.
Next thing I know, she's got a knife to my face.
[laughter] I would have been scared if she hadn't been the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my life.
Oh.
One thing leads to another, and all of a sudden, we're playing tonsil tennis on a broken toilet - in the alley out back.
- Cute.
So how did you and Eleanor become friends? Let's just say that we "lived" in the same "neighborhood.
Today is PTA elections, and I'm running for secretary.
And she's a shoo-in, too.
Hey, Patty, we got to get ready, okay? I know we came here to set your mom on a better path, but I think she's doing pretty great.
Please.
She's completely full of it.
I am gonna find out what kind of scam Donna Shellstrop is running, and I am gonna take her down right after I finish this awesome drink.
Man, Dave's margaritas are amazing.
- Right? - Yeah.
So this is what a museum looks like.
If you look at this painting closely, you can really notice the interpretation.
I know you're just being silly and effortlessly charming, but you actually just picked the most valuable painting in the entire museum.
As of last year, that work was valued at $39.
2 million.
Oh, snap, I forgot you know everything.
How much is that one worth? That one is worth $13.
7 million.
Can we do this for all the paintings? Look, I've had a sort of revelation about the world, and I'd like to take responsibility for my part in our fraught history.
For whatever hurt I've caused you I sincerely apologize.
Thank you.
I do not accept your apology.
Is that all, then? [scoffs] Well [chuckling angrily] - Ooh! - [gasps] [groans angrily] Check out what Dave gave me plans for a Subaru dealership/burlesque club he's designing in Reno.
Man, Nevada's a mess.
What are you doing? Searching for the tell-tale sign of a Donna Shellstrop scam a pile of cash hidden somewhere so she can grab it and head out on the run.
When the time comes, she will rip this guy off and disappear like Keyser Soze, right after he admitted to groping all those people.
- Cool.
I don't know anything about kids.
Hey, has Diana ever made you hide, like, a special treasure in any of your toys? No, Diana's very nice to me.
She bought me most of these stuffed animals.
[gasps] Oh, wow.
Neat.
Mind if I give them just a little surgery just to check? Okay, okay, okay, all right, Doc McStuffins, let's get you some fresh air.
So sorry.
Fine.
New plan.
You casually mention that you're rich and seduce Donna.
When she goes for you, it will prove that this whole thing is a sham.
First things first, do you have a penis? I will not seduce Donna.
For one thing, I could never do that to my pal, Dave.
It goes against the architect's code.
Also, your mother seems happy here.
Look, believe me, don't believe me I don't care.
I'm gonna prove it.
Young lady, you will stop this nonsense.
Go to the PTA meeting and support your mother.
I won't hear another word about it.
What the hell was that? Well, I was going for the "stern but, you know, caring dad" vibe.
No? Didn't work? No, not even close like, not in the ballpark.
I was trying something, Eleanor.
Also, I'm going to strangle her, which will hinder any air from getting into her lungs.
- Can I talk to her? - [sighs] Maybe we should try a little third-party mediation.
[indistinct chatter] Uh, hi.
I'm Tahani's friend, Chidi.
Chidi is an Igbo word that means "God exists.
" That's right Sorry, I don't know the etymology of your name, but All of your fears are now mine.
[mystical music] - What did she say? - What? I don't know.
Sorry.
All of my fears are hers now.
Of course they are.
Um I sincerely apologize to you because I have matured into a fully formed adult with empathy and self-awareness.
But if you don't accept my apology, I will smash your stupid art exhibit into bits.
More Tahani theatrics with zero follow-through? You don't have it in you to do anything that bold, because I'm the one who got the boldness gene and the good-eyebrow gene.
[gasps, shouts] Oh! Oh, no.
All my fears are mine again.
Hey, Davey, can you believe the design of this room? Auditorium? More like Audi-bore-me-um.
I never thought I'd run for PTA board.
For most of my life, I preferred to crawl pub crawl.
[laughter] But now I want to make sure kids in this decommissioned-military- bombing-test-site- turned-suburban-township get the best education Nevada has to offer.
[scoffs] What's that always double down on 11? Also, there is a pretty great kid who goes to this school, and I want to make this place great for her.
- Stand up, sweetheart.
- [applause] Well, it was the first Hooters ever made out of brick, sort of inspired by Monticello.
- Hey, mark.
- Oh, no, it's Dave.
Easy.
I got news for you, dad-bod.
The woman you know as Diana Tremaine is really Donna Shellstrop, my much older mother.
She faked her death and changed her name.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's the deal.
I already knew all that, Eleanor.
Your mother told me everything the first night we met.
The first night? Well, no, not the first night, actually.
- Yikes.
- No, no, no, it's perfect for me 'cause I don't know what I want.
But anyway, the next morning she told me everything.
And we're gonna tell Patricia once she's a little bit older.
For now, everything is going great.
No, dude, you don't know my mom.
She used to put, like, 50 things in a shopping cart, then go to the "12 items or less" aisle, scream "rat," and run out the door without paying.
She is a liar.
It kind of gets my motor running.
Tell you the truth she's turning me into a bit of a bad boy.
I mean, who am I Avril Lavigne? [men laugh] [mysterious music] Oh, I get it.
Coming clean was all part of the scam.
It's brilliant because he thinks she's honest.
So, when she runs off with all his money, he'll never see it coming.
Come on, Eleanor.
I changed, you changed, maybe she changed, too.
I wanted the mom who made me afternoon snacks instead of just telling me to look for loose fries in the McDonald's ball pit.
Why does Patricia get that mom? If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed, then that means she was always capable of change, but I just wasn't worth changing for.
I know as your self-appointed father figure, I'm supposed to say something comforting here, but I'm I'm kind of stumped.
Okay, final tally 43 votes for Diana Tremaine, 12 votes for Eileen Capshaw, and one vote for Bofa Deeznutz.
God, don't look at me like that.
You're not my real dad.
Congratulations, Madam Secretary.
It's so crazy, right? I'm gonna need to get a calculator and maybe a globe.
I just never thought I'd see the day when you made a commitment to anything.
I was wrong.
Thank you, baby.
That means a lot.
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no, not that one! Not that one! No, sorry, sorry.
This powder is only for my delicates.
You don't wash your bras.
[gasps] I knew it.
My mother is a con artist.
Got ya.
So, before I'm tortured in the afterlife, I get to spend the rest of this life in a Hungarian prison for destruction of art.
That's fun.
Destruction of extremely derivative art.
Kamilah's work has been mediocre for years.
Mother and Father are probably rolling over in their cryogenic chambers.
The two of them were a unit, and Kamilah and I [epiphanic music] Girls, we have a new challenge for you.
Each of you has four hours to complete a rendering of your favorite moment in French military history.
The winning painting shall be hung in our foyer during our party honoring Francois Mitterrand.
The losing painting shall provide the kindling for the fire that rages in our hearth during that party.
[laughs] Doesn't that sound wonderful? Yes, Mother, it does.
Thank you for this opportunity.
Who will be the winning artist, and who will fail? Let's find out.
[serious music] These paintings they're us.
Here we go.
What? Tahani, what are you doing? Stop it.
No.
I'm going to hug you because I love you and because you feel just as alone as I do.
I'm sorry our parents were such wankers.
And I understand that you can't accept my apology because that would quench your creative thirst.
They forced us to compete, and that competition has fueled your art for decades.
It's so awful, and I'm so sorry.
Diana Tremaine, you little devil.
New name, same game.
Fine.
Things have been going good with me and Dave, but sometimes I sneak a little bit of cash out of his wallet, and I hide it away, just in case everything blows up and I need to skip town.
Are you happy? Actually, no, I'm not happy, but I think you are.
You're holding on to this exit strategy, telling yourself that you can bail at any time, but the truth is you love this suburban life.
I don't love it so much.
I am not basic.
Ya basic.
And that's okay.
Let me ask you something.
Why are you wearing yoga pants? Well, on Tuesday nights, I do restorative yoga with a bunch of moms from Patty's school.
And what do you do after yoga? We split avocado egg rolls at the Cheesecake Factory, but we also drink.
- What do you drink? - Chardonnay - with ice cubes.
- [sighs] And after one glass, I get sleepy, so I usually switch to water so I can drive home like a nerd! Hey, hey [chuckles] It's okay.
It's good.
And I think you know what you have to do with it.
Send it to Gene Simmons? What? No.
Spend it on Patricia.
Set up a college fund, buy her a crib or a car.
I truly don't know anything about kids, but this is your chance to break the chain of Shellstrop mother-daughter crappiness.
You have a do-over.
Use it.
Oh, baby.
It's why I don't wash them.
I still can't believe that police officer pulled you over just to tell you that you were driving perfectly.
Why not? I was.
There is an article in the paper about Kamilah's latest art installation.
And look "A Fractured Inheritance" by Kamilah Al-Jamil and Tahani Al-Jamil.
Gosh, that was very big of her though she really should have named the piece "Buried Hatchet," don't you think? Such a better title.
I'm going to call her and rub it in.
Maybe don't for now.
- Good luck, buddy.
- [chuckles] Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
I sketched you up a little something some ideas there for your project.
- Wow.
- [chuckles] Well, this is more than a few ideas.
You solved the whole thing columns and porticos.
Uh-oh.
[laughing] Looks like you forgot to include bathrooms.
I certainly use the bathroom like anybody else.
I love to sit on the the thing and just, you know, shoot one out.
Eleanor, I'll be in the car.
It was really nice to meet you, Patricia.
Got a lot of people who care about you here.
And good luck with the - SATs.
- I'm nine.
Whatever, good luck in school.
We'll be picking them up in a few hours.
Oh, be happy.
Your mom found a better path all on her own, and you definitely helped Patricia.
Double happy ending.
I know.
I'm just I'm a little sad.
I'm glad my mom has changed, but that doesn't fix all the damage she did to me.
Let's face it she's the reason I could never get close to anyone.
Um you remember how I told you that you knew everything important about your life? Well, I-I wasn't thinking about your afterlife life.
In one of the reboots, you and Chidi fell in love deeply, and you told him that you loved him, and he told you that he loved you back.
We did what, now? You want to listen to a podcast maybe?
This library's depressing.
All they have in the Poetry section is Jeff Foxworthy books.
Well, we needed someplace deserted, and there's no place more deserted than a public library in Arizona.
Now let's go, man.
We only have a few hours before we have to pick the gang up from the airport.
In one of the reboots, you and Chidi were in love.
Can't you just take my word for that? No, dude, I can't.
My screwed-up relationship with my parents made me believe I could never really love anyone.
I need to see it for myself.
Those are my memories.
I want them back.
Okay, fine.
Have a seat.
[LIGHT MUSIC] - What's all that for? - You'll see.
We're gonna start with a simple, three-second memory.
- Why only three second - [DEVICE BEEPS] Oh, hi, Eleanor.
Buongiorno, Eleanor.
Morning, Bambadjan.
Morning, Vicky.
Ugh.
Those two are such forking dweebs.
[COUGHS WEAKLY] [TEETH CLATTER] [PLEASANT MUSIC] Ah, looking a little better.
The banana must have helped.
Before we go any further, I have one very important question.
Did I look hot bald? 'Cause I always kind of felt like I could pull it off.
I have no real ability to gauge physical attractiveness in humans.
But no, you did not pull it off.
Okay, that short clip should have rewired your brain, like an inoculation.
So now I can show you the highlights of reboot 119.
[DEVICE BEEPS] So, we are moving onto the subject of free will versus determinism.
We are officially done with Nietzsche.
Aww.
I'm gonna miss Nietzsche.
I spent a lot of my life thinking I was better than everyone else, and he showed me why I was right.
Give me that reading list.
What do we got? Ooh, a little Aristotle, little Descartes, little Tommy Quine-Quine.
That's what I call Saint Thomas Aquinas.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] Can you believe my high school voted me "Most Likely to Die Young and Unaccomplished?" You did die young and unaccomplished.
Fair enough.
- Put those back in.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] Ah! My favorite four residents.
Don't tell the others.
[LAUGHS] Welcome to "Pick a Pet Day.
" We have hundreds of beautiful animals for you to choose from.
And when you do make your choice, your pet will bond to your soul forever.
- Ah.
- I'm going to look at the mythical pets, darling.
Catch up when you're ready.
- May I? Yeah? - Yes.
Dude, we can get mythical animals? Maybe I'll get a penguin.
Penguins are real.
That's the spirit, Eleanor.
They're real to me too.
But this one looks a little a little sweeter.
- Maybe - Uh-oh.
It's Chidi kryptonite, a choice between any two things.
Settle in, lizard.
This is gonna be a while.
Michael, what's a "Mirror Centaur?" Ah, a stunning creature, whose human half takes on the image of its companion.
- [CHIME] - [SHIMMERING TONES] Greetings.
I am T'Hania, Goddess of Beauty.
I'm sure they're both incredible.
Just choose one.
You're right.
The black one.
That was my first impulse, and that is the one I'll take.
I'm so sorry, Chidi.
Both puppies have been taken.
Yeah, I should have seen that coming.
A 16-foot albino python - Mm-mm.
- Something called a "tarantula-squid," and this owl.
The Tarantula-squid.
Tarantula-squid.
Tarantula-squid.
Tarantula-squid.
I'll take the owl.
- [DOOR SHUTS] - Check it out.
Spencer doesn't like loud voices.
Yeesh.
What happened, man? Well, I was trying to teach him to play fetch, like I did with my puppy as a kid, but instead of retrieving the stick, he attacked my face with his razor-sharp talons.
Why don't you just ask Michael for a dog? Because it was my mistake to not pick a puppy fast enough.
I made my bed, and now I'll bleed in it.
Let me do that, dummy.
Come here.
What if I talk to Michael for you? That way you don't have to worry about feeling ungrateful, or whatever, and maybe you'll still get a puppy.
- You'd do that? - Of course.
It's the least I can do, considering everything you've done for me.
[GENTLE MUSIC] So you get it, right? - Hey.
- What? You liked him, he liked you.
You did nice things for each other.
Your lack of parental affection did not make you numb to love, blah blah blah.
"Blah blah blah"? Why don't you want me to see this? - What are you hiding? - Nothing.
It's just, the rest is not interesting.
" Just watching myself fall in love for the first time in fake heaven.
What else is on? I am going to put this back in my ear, and you are going to show me how thoughtful and caring I am, or I'm gonna rip off your demon head and shove it up whatever's where your butt should be.
Roll it.
Oh, a lizard was a perfect choice, Eleanor.
- You both have combination skin.
- Thanks.
Hey, this is a weird question to ask.
I'll just throw it out there.
Turns out centaurs are a bit tricky.
You didn't have like a stable full of horses growing up? Oh, of course, but they just pulled our carriages, or performed in our horse ballets.
They weren't so what's the word? - [HORSE SHOES CLOPPING] - Judgmental.
With whom can I speak about acquiring new shoes? You can't expect me to walk around in these flats all day, like some common glue factory, hobo horse.
Eleanor, you were looking for me? Uh, yeah, so, Chidi chose an owl, because he froze up trying to decide between two puppies.
Is it possible for him to swap? Of course.
This is the Good Place.
But he might want to hold off.
Tahani, would you host the party at your mansion? Of course.
I'd love to.
Is that what you're going to wear? What? N no.
No.
Of course not.
[SOFT LAUGH] Why? Is it unflattering? I I can change.
Guys? I can't find my lizard.
He was just out there, like one second ago.
No, I can't risk it.
These pets are supposed to, like, bond to our souls forever.
If Michael finds out mine ran away, he could figure out I'm not the real Eleanor.
Just, um, go without me, and tell people that I'm hanging out with my lizard, because we are so meshed together, or, whatever circle of life crap like that.
- You sure? - Yeah.
Go enjoy flying.
I'll meet you there.
Come on, Bleek.
I've just been a little jumpy.
Hey, you didn't happen to see my lizard in the lake, when you were thrashing around down there? No.
It was cold and dark and scary.
But don't worry, we'll find him.
Michael and Janet are busy transforming people, anyway, so they didn't even notice you weren't there.
Holy crap, you're supposed to be flying right now.
It's no big deal, I just decided I'd rather be helping you.
Than soaring through the air like an owl? That's amazing.
You studied philosophy together.
You even got Chidi hooked on popcorn shrimp.
Eventually, you became suspicious of me, and escaped to Mindy St.
Claire's house on a train.
That was the first time you actually said it out loud.
I love you.
And you don't need to respond, 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel I love you too.
That's the story.
- Can we go now? - How did it end? Like it always did, with me rebooting you.
There's there's no need to Show me, please.
[DEVICE BEEPS] [YAWNS] All right.
Let's get this over with.
- So, listen guys - No, you listen.
We just went to Mindy St.
Claire's, and when she wasn't trying to trick us into having a threesome, she filled us in on everything that you've been up to here.
Oh, yeah? We know this is, like, the hundredth time you've tried to torture us, but this time it's different, because we're in love.
Love is stronger than anything I can throw at you? I could throw an elephant at you.
You think a thrown elephant wouldn't crush you because of love? She was speaking metaphorically.
Even metaphorically, it's lame.
It's okay.
No matter what he does, we will find each other, and we will help each other, because we're soul mates.
[BLOWS RASPBERRY] There's no such thing as soul mates, you dingus.
I made it up.
I put clowns in your house because you hate them.
I didn't want you to see how cruel I used to be.
Plus, I wore a lot of French cuff shirts back then.
I thought it made me look classy.
It's it's it's all embarrassing.
But I'm different now, I promise.
I'll swear on a Bible like you humans do.
I could grab one right now.
It's the only book they have in the Sex Ed section.
I'm just sad, because I thought for a second I could love someone.
But really, it was just you manipulating me into thinking I loved someone.
So, I guess I was right.
I'm incapable of love.
[MELANCHOLY MUSIC] Eh, that's no biggie.
Do you wanna get burgers? [EXHALES] Hang on, how did you draw that conclusion? You just watched yourself fall in love with Chidi.
No, I didn't, I watched a puppeteer pull a bunch of strings to make us think we were in love.
You said it yourself, you made it all up.
But I never intended for you to fall in love.
Once you made us bond, the romance was inevitable.
It's a basic reality show playbook.
Put a bunch of attractive young people in stressful situations, so they act like idiots and have sex with each other.
This is all just determinism.
What? "Determinism is the theory that "we have no control over our own actions.
"Everything we do happens because of some external force, which exists outside of our control.
" I didn't choose to fall in love with Chidi, because some all-knowing demon, you, brought us together and scripted our lives.
You kind of did.
You orchestrated the whole "pet day" thing, manipulated us into choosing specific animals, made my lizard run away, which led to Chidi coming to help me find it, which led to us kissing, which led to us falling in love.
None of that was my choice.
Everything in my life has been determined by my upbringing, my genetics, or or my environment.
And everything in my afterlife was determined by you.
There is no such thing as free will.
[CLEARS THROAT] We're closing up soon, guys.
Yeah, can we just have 15 minutes? We're kind of in the middle of something.
Okay.
[NEON BUZZING] You want something to drink? Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
But whatever I choose will be the result of millions of biological, genetic, and societal factors that are entirely outside my control.
Iced tea.
Oh, that sounds good.
I'll have one too.
Okay.
You think you have no free will, because I scripted everything that happened, right? All I have to do is prove that you made one choice that I couldn't anticipate.
Dude-dude-dude! - What? - Yelling You're you're yelling.
- Oh - Like, so loudly.
Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Yeah.
Watch this, it's from the very first attempt.
[DEVICE BEEPS] If anyone has any information - Oh, boy.
- About any of this Okay, easy.
Michael.
The problem in the neighborhood is me.
You saw your friend in pain, and you decided to sacrifice yourself to help him.
That wasn't me pulling a string or manipulating you.
In fact, it was the last thing I wanted.
Ruined my whole plan.
- Free will.
- No, dude.
But, no, you were constantly doing stuff I couldn't anticipate.
As a matter of fact, I complained to you once, right right to your face.
- I think it was reboot 444.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] Now, is Chidi trapped in the purple space bubble? Yes.
Is he in pain? Almost certainly.
Will he ever get out? No.
However Uh, yeah, uh wrong one.
Wrong one.
But uh not not the one I was thinking.
- [SIGHS] - It's probably, uh, 445.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] - [DRAMATIC WHOOSH] [SOFT POND AMBIENCE] [DOOR OPENS] You.
In here.
[PENSIVE MUSIC] Where am I? Hell.
You're in Hell.
Can I ask you something? Have I missed anything in that freaky little noodle of yours? See I I've studied everything about your life.
I know your hopes, your fears, your psychology, your tendencies.
You keep making crazy choices I don't understand.
[SCREEN CHIMES] Am I missing something? I'm sorry.
Can we rewind for a second? Who are you? Who is that guy? Am I dead? Is Sam the Eagle here? No.
[SNAPS] I tried to script your whole afterlife.
And I devised a 15 million-point plan to torture you.
You made choices I never saw coming.
I call that free will.
What if all your choices are predetermined? Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
And maybe all the mega-demons are just fulfilling a destiny laid out by a bunch of super intelligent tarantula-squids, who are torturing them, be [GASPS] [ICE CLATTERING] Why did you do that? - Because I have free will.
- [SIGHS] And because you're being so annoying.
Uh.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry that he did that.
- Happens all the time.
- [SIGHS] Usually it's the younger woman doing it to the older guy, though.
Dude! Not cool.
Do you really not see what's happening here? Do you want me to spell it out for you? This is a defense mechanism, Eleanor.
You saw yourself fall in love with Chidi, and it freaked you out to see yourself be so vulnerable.
So, you're using determinism to convince yourself that those feelings were not real.
You know, you don't know me, man.
Yes, I do, I know everything about you, remember? Including that nothing scares you more than vulnerability.
[SCOFFS] Whatever.
Who even cares? I do.
Because if everything is determined, and we have no free will, then all the stuff we're doing to put more good into the world is pointless.
Worst possible use of free will, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because I care about them.
[MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS] You might wanna head out too.
We're closing soon, and the second we do, they use this place to shoot porn.
[SIGHS] First class was amazing.
They give you so many free presents.
A shaving kit, an eye mask oh, a vest.
[AIR HISSING] At times like this, it's fun to remember that we're legally married.
[LAUGHS] That is fun.
I was scared about what it all meant, and I went back to one of my favorite moves, turn on the ol' Blame Hose.
[WHISPERING] "This is all you fault.
" Apology accepted.
And I'm sorry I dumped iced tea on your head.
Are you kidding me? You did exactly what you should do when you're friend is being annoying.
You snapped me out of it.
It also made me realize, in a weird way, we are the only truly free beings in the universe, because we actually know what's up with the afterlife.
And I think that means we need to be bold.
We need to find someone who can serve as a as a blueprint for humanity, someone who's life is so great that we can use it as a model to get as many points for as many people as possible.
And I think I know that perfect person.
Rihanna.
Good call.
I don't know her personally, but I did see her in Vegas once, and her calf brushed up against my tongue.
I licked her leg.
I was kicked out.
It's not Rihanna.
We have no idea if it'll work.
Oh, I'm sure it's perfect.
- Give it a try, Shawn.
- Me? I'm not going through that thing.
She is.
Ask Michael how many times he rebooted them.
- He's lying - Yeah, zip it, toots.
We're way past that.
See if you explode.
[GIGGLING] This might be gross.
[ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] [WARBLING] Oh.
Am I on Earth? Did you figure out a way to build an illegal door to Earth? [ELECTRICAL WARBLING] Yes.
That's exactly what I did.
- Well, we all helped.
- Shut up, Glenn.
La la la la la Did you ever lie and listen to the rain fall Did you ever own a homemade apple pie Did you ever watch a child while he was praying Just don't let the good life pass you by Did you ever hold the hand of starving [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Hello.
I'm looking for a Doug Forcett? Well, I'm Doug Forcett.
How? Oh, yes.
Yes, you are.
Sorry, um, I'm a reporter for the "Calgary Times Examiner.
" My name is Michael Scoop.
This is my photographer, Janet Scoop.
- She's my sister with the scoops.
- Oh, boy.
What do you say? Okay, well let me think.
Well, first off, I'm so flattered that you'd want to do a whole news story just about me.
That's so nice.
A heartfelt thanks to the whole Scoop family.
Can I ask is your newspaper printed on recycled paper? Yes, no, very recycled.
The most.
Well, all right then.
Come on in.
Can Janet take a photo of you for the paper? Oh.
[CHUCKLES] Okay, can you look up a little and to the right? Smile, but only with your mouth and not your eyes.
Perfect.
[PLEASANT MUSIC] It was 1972.
My friend Randy and I ate some magic mushrooms.
Randy asked me, "what do you think happens when you die?" And I saw with perfect clarity how the afterlife works.
Immediately I knew I had to live a perfect life.
Well, not immediately.
And I've been living it ever since.
I know, this sounds crazy.
No! No, actually it makes it makes perfect sense.
Oh.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, boy.
You've been sitting here for ten minutes and I haven't offered you anything to eat or drink.
Would you like some water or fresh radishes? Water would be great.
Janet, how cool is he? You know, for a celebrity, he's amazingly down to earth.
He's so thoughtful with his actions.
Thank goodness he had that hallucination.
He could have had the one Randy had where everything was made of ears.
Way less helpful.
We have to learn everything we can about what makes him tick so we can use it to help others.
He is the blueprint, Janet.
He figured it all out.
Here we go two waters.
Oh.
Well, that has an interesting aftertaste.
- Is that from a nearby river? - Oh, no.
Why take fresh water away from the beavers and the fish? No, I have my composting toilet hooked up to a water filtration system.
One man's waste is another man's water.
And both men are me.
[BOTH LAUGH] Hmm.
Yeah, I'm pretty excited to relax and have a drink.
You need to get your blood flowing.
There's a pool table over there.
- Wanna play? - Yeah, sure.
Why not.
Let's do it.
Tahani, can I ask your advice about something? Is it about your grating speaking voice? I'm so glad you finally brought it up.
Because, honestly, with a few elocution lessons No, I wanna ask you about Chidi.
What's wrong with my voice? Nothing.
So, it must get lonely up here all by yourself without anyone to talk to.
Oh, I've got lots of friends.
There's this little guy, for example.
Yeah, it's a snail.
Hi, snail.
I don't name them in case they already have a name they prefer.
- Huh.
- So, this is an organic garden? Yeah.
I thought it'd be mean to dig it up.
Mean to the radishes? I also grow lentils because they require very little water and have the smallest carbon footprint.
Huh.
All he consumes are lentils and radishes.
No, Janet.
He also consumes his own waste.
So, everything's fine.
How do you play pool again? What are the rules? That's one of the best things about pool, dawg.
Me and my friends play a special Jacksonville style of pool.
It's called "Special Jacksonville-style pool.
" You hit whatever ball you want but you use your hands.
And: that's it.
Okay, your turn.
I got a thousand points.
Oh, that's the other rule.
You make up your own points.
But he doesn't remember any of that happened, so I guess my question is, When is the right time to tell someone you were passionate lovers in an alternate timeline in the afterlife but he doesn't remember because technically none of that happened in this strand of the multi-verse? - Ugh.
- You know what? I'll just check with Yahoo answers.
- I'm sure someone's weighed in.
- Nope, nope.
I'm flattered you would seek my advice.
Though, I suppose, it makes sense.
I'm sure the one constant in all the reboots is that you and I are best friends.
Uh-huh.
Look, I don't think you would want Chidi to know what happened in the past unless you wanted it to happen again in the present.
You can't know how Chidi will react.
It may be painful but it's never a bad idea to tell someone how you feel.
Thanks, Tahani.
You give really good advice.
And you made a really hot centaur.
Sorry? So, these are some of my 71 adopted dogs and wolves.
You've rescued every stray animal that's ever wandered onto your property? Oh, yes, ma'am.
Oh, this is fun.
You get to meet Raymond.
- Hi, Raymond.
- Hi, dumdum.
Who are these two hosers? Don't worry about Raymond.
He's just a local sociopath who comes by my house to take advantage of me.
Yeah, I got your laundry all folded and ready for you.
For whatever reason, this loser does whatever you tell him to do.
- Would that make you happy? - Very happy.
Now give him your shoe.
Well, that's okay, Doug, don't I don't need your shoe.
Please don't give me your shoe.
Well, then give me your shoe, or I'll be sad.
There you are.
[LAUGHING] Well, as long as he's happy.
See, if I make him happy, I get the points.
Ow.
Oh, that's a bleeder.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Michael, face facts.
Doug is not the blueprint of how to live a good life.
He's become a happiness pump.
What? Remember from Chidi's lessons? I remember the term happiness pump.
A happiness pump is someone who is obsessed with maximizing the overall good at his or her expense.
Doug will do literally anything to make other people happy even if it makes him miserable.
Oh, I don't think he's miserable.
So, everyone happy and contented in here? What's Oh, I volunteered to test cosmetics for a local company so they don't have to test on animals.
- It's fun! - Huh.
For the animals who don't have to do it.
For me, it's like wearing a mask of fire.
Uh, what can I do for you now? Would you like to move in, permanently? Or would either of you like any more water - or one of my kidneys? - You know what? We have absolutely everything we need.
Okay, well, it was so nice to meet you, Janet, and you, Mark.
I mean Michael.
I called you Mark.
Your name is Michael.
No, no, that's okay.
Hey, hey.
Stay with me here, buddy.
No, no, no, no, this is very bad.
Lie.
That's a lie! Now I'm accusing you of lying.
Now I'm yelling.
Why am I yelling? I need to make this up.
I'm going to give you a really nice haircut.
[SQUISHING] - Was that - A snail? Yeah that was a Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think he's still alive.
Do either of you know anything about snail first aid? - No.
" All right, Michael, I need you to find some scotch tape while I apply pressure.
Too much pressure.
I'm gonna need that tape! Oh, What?! Jacksonville style, baby.
Thirty million points.
Nice one, homie.
Hey, what are you guys doing? Well, I either know exactly what I'm doing and it's something, or we're doing nothing and I'm winning.
Congrats.
Can I talk to you for a second? Okay, a few days ago, Michael showed me something.
No, you jetlagged doof.
Bambadjan is the name of a demon from the Bad Place who is somehow right over there.
Come with me right now.
Okay, okay.
Hey guys, having fun? Cool, cool, cool.
So, we need to get out of here immediately because this bar is full of demons.
Eleanor, just because these people are wearing cheap leather and stone washed denim, they're still part of the Queen's realm.
Calling them demons is a bit much.
Okay, Chidi and I are going to go out the side door.
You and Tahani go out the back.
Or we do this the old fashioned way.
How did you make that so fast? Bortle [MUFFLED CRY] Hello, idiots.
Surprised to see me? [SIGHS] Right.
You don't remember.
I'm Sean.
You are very scared of me.
Michael, would you care to say a few words? [CHUCKLES] Oh, you're serious.
Yes.
Um, okay.
Martin was a lot of things.
A snail, mostly.
But also a friend.
Martin taught us about life, about love, and about the limits of scotch tape.
Goodbye, Martin.
I've decided to make a donation to the Canadian Mollusk Association in Martin's honor.
Their office is in Edmonton, so it will take me about three weeks to walk there and back.
Take care.
Okay, look out little fellow.
Heads up.
- Here comes a shoe.
- Say, Doug, look.
Do you mind if we ask you just a few more questions? What you're doing here how you're living your life just so wonderful.
No, look, look.
Um I've been a reporter for a long time, Doug.
Met all sorts of people.
Traveled all over this crazy blue marble.
Meeting regular folks.
Every face tells a story, Doug.
Why, I'd say that those so-called regular folks often turn out to be not so regular after all.
- Michael.
If what you're saying is true about the afterlife, then you must have earned more than enough points by now.
So, loosen up, bud.
Have a little fun.
Eat something besides lentils.
- Like radishes? - No, no, Doug.
Dammit.
Just have ice cream or chicken parm.
Live your life.
Okay? Just relax.
Thank you, Michael.
But no.
I can't do any of those things.
Why not? Because I can't risk it.
There's an accountant out there somewhere measuring the value of everything I do.
What if I relax and do something that loses me just enough points to keep me out of the Good Place and I'm tortured for eternity? No, I have to make every moment count.
It's the only rational way to live.
I love seeing the look on people's faces.
It's the best part of my job.
Dude, Michael's not coming here.
Face it, man.
You are outmatched, because Michael and Janet are brilliant and savvy and they've been ten steps ahead of you this whole time.
We can sit here as long as you want.
But you will never, ever, ever, see Michael or Janet aga Yikes, that was rough.
Total bust.
Hello, Michael.
See? See the look on his face? So great.
Hello, Sean.
Other demons.
What are y'all doing down here? What do you think we're doing, you hemorrhoid? We're ending this charade once and for all.
These four humans are the legal property of the Bad Place.
That's where we're taking them.
[MYSTICAL WHOOSHING] And you.
Well, it's a bad idea.
Oh, Michael.
When will you ever Screw this.
Let's fight! [BLOWS LANDING] Get somewhere safe, you guys.
Bad news.
I've been going to the gym, a lot.
Oh, no.
What is happening? Let him go! Let him go! [GRUNTING] Let him go! Twelve years of fencing.
That would be a three-tenths deduction.
No, no, watch out.
Watch out.
[PORTAL HUMMING] I've never marbleized a Janet before.
[BALL CLACKS] Jacksonville style, baby.
Two thousand points! Thanks, Jason.
[GRUNTING] Janet.
Door.
What am I waiting for? We could die in the next 30 seconds.
So, Michael showed me a memory of our time in the Good Place and you and I were, like, a thing.
- And - Gotcha! Not like a casual, "Hey, I found two loose pills "in the bottom of my tote, let's pop 'em and see what's good," kinda thing.
We were in love, and there's a real possibility that I'm in love with you again.
Here.
On this plane of existence.
Today.
Now.
[PORTAL WHOOSHING] No! No! Oh, cool.
When I'm even partway through the door to the afterlife, my powers come back.
They do? [SCREAMS] They do.
Thanks for asking.
[SCREAMS] You're coming with me.
Hi, there.
[SCREAMS] [GASPS] - We did it! - It was, um Well, no, yeah, no.
Of course of course Janet did it.
- We built our own door.
- That's impossible.
[MOCKING] That's impossible.
Ugh, you're such a dweeb.
Why can't you leave us alone? You don't have enough nostrils to stuff with wasps? I don't want just any wasp nostrils I want these wasp nostrils.
You're just delaying the inevitable, Michael.
The Bad Place is going to get all of them eventually.
These four, their loved ones, even your precious pee-pee king, Doug Forcett.
- [MYSTICAL WHOOSHING] [WHOOSHING] I mean, why let the guy keep saying mean stuff, right? I thought Doug Forcett was the blueprint for leading a good life? He seems pretty confident that Doug is heading to the Bad Place.
For a while now, I have felt like there was something wrong with how the point system was evaluating humans.
At first I thought it was that the system didn't allow for the possibility that people could improve.
That's why I convinced the Judge to send you back to Earth so you could confront the ways you were living.
But now I'm worried that the problems with the system might be much more serious.
We need to gather some real evidence.
Uh, sorry, no, no Michael.
You're confused.
Jason, quick, I need that coaster over there behind the pillar.
You got it, boss.
I just needed a 30 second break.
- Yeah.
- What sort of evidence is this and how do we get it? Janet and I have to go right to the source of the points themselves the Accountant's office.
The four of you stay here at Doug Forcett's house until I get back.
You're gonna need to feed all the dogs and the wolves, and if a teenager shows up on a dirt bike just do as he says.
He's very scary.
That's okay, bud.
Thanks anyway.
Look, we won't be long and you guys should be safe here.
Actually, scratch that.
We're all screwed because a bunch more demons just showed up.
There's too many of them.
What do we do? I have an idea.
I think I can take you into my void.
Let's go into a void.
Okay, let's go.
But, just to be clear I don't know if you'll survive in my void, but either way, all of you will definitely die on Earth when I do this, so look around and say goodbye.
Goodbye, Earth.
Wait, did you just say we're gonna die?
Wow! Ho-ho! Oh, Janet, you did it! You brought us into your void.
If I had a heart, it would be pounding.
- Michael - You know, you'd think there'd be side effects, but I feel great.
Dude, why are there so many Janets? Anwhy do I sound like Janet? You also look like Janet.
Do I? Why? What? What is happening? [groans] Oh, no, am I wearing a vest? Ooh, Michael, help me! This is going to be tricky.
How do we even tell them apart? Oh! [laughs] Okay, that one's Jason.
[bright music] I can't put the humans back in their own bodies, so I've done the next best, but still not that great, thing.
A high-neck sleeveless? - I suppose this outfit will do? - [sarcastically] Are you sure? I mean, wearing a floral print to an infinite void at this time of the nothing? So where are we exactly? We're not on Earth, right? That's correct, Chidi-Janet.
You're not.
Your real bodies dematerialized when you entered my void, and your essences reconstituted themselves in this form.
Cool, cool.
It makes it way worse.
I just want to lie down.
Where is down? I found it.
It's up here.
It's dope.
I have an idea.
- [soft beep] - Sweet.
I call sofa.
But, Michael, why can't we go with you? Well, you just died, which means you're the first humans in history to not immediately go to the Good or Bad Place, which, in turn, makes you inter-dimensional fugitives.
So that's neat.
Also, the Judge is probably still pissed at me for, you know, breaking all the rules, and she might take it out on you.
Plus, the Bad Place is probably hunting for us, so, literally, the entire universe is against you.
Okay, but what's a fourth really good reason? Jeez, just trying to lighten the mood tough void.
Now, Janet and I will pose as Good Place employees and sweet-talk the Accountant into showing us his books.
If I'm right, we will find proof that the Bad Place is tampering with the point system.
The Accountant will tell us what to do, and this will all be over.
- Bye.
- [soft beep] [tense music] Is that a Good Janet or a Bad Janet? That's a Neutral Janet.
She's sort of the black sheep of the Janet world.
Or blank sheep, I guess.
Ooh, I can throw shade now.
That's cool.
You've arrived at the Accounting Office.
All point calculations for actions taken on Earth are made here.
I need to speak with the Head Accountant on official Good Place business.
I will inform the Head Accountant of your presence, and he either will or will not see you in a certain amount of time end of conversation.
Wow.
Good thing your void plan worked out, huh? [sighs, burps] [auto-tuned burp] Believe in life after love? Oh, having four humans in my void is weird.
This is nuts.
We're in a void in the body of a white lady.
- Not a lady.
- Not a lady, darling.
I found it on Etsy.
There was nowhere to park.
Did you refill the Brita? I find this void quite calming, actually.
It's like, this time, the Xanax took me.
Oh, I have the worst stomachache.
Dude, relax.
Here, let me see if I can figure this out.
[soft beep] Oh, wow, Eleanor! How'd you do that? I don't know.
What just happened? What did you do? Sorry, I'm just trying to help Chidi calm down The structural integrity of this void is already at risk.
You can't start randomly conjuring up objects, or it might shatter the void.
Yes, it might.
It might make everything blow up, and we'll all disappear forever.
Mwah.
So stop it! [soft beep] [tense music] [soft beep] Everything okay? - Nope.
- Well The Head Accountant has decided to see you.
This will happen now.
Hey-o! [chuckles] There they are.
Good to see you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Neil, Head Accountant.
- You must be Janet and Michael? - Yes.
[chuckles] Can I just say, I really depreciate you coming.
Huh? A little bit of accounting humor.
- Ah.
I'm worried that, somehow, the Bad Place has been tampering.
Tampering? No, no, no.
Quite impossible.
Laughable, really.
Janet, can you remind me to laugh at that later? Your amusement has been scheduled.
End of conversation.
She's a lot of fun.
Could you just humor us, though? Show us how the system works? Uh, well, I suppose I could give you a quick tour.
Eleanor, how'd you know I always wanted a dog like this? Funny story, it's one of the things I saw in the alternate timeline, where we were soul mates on and off for 300 years.
Maybe we should talk about that? Well, I suppose we can, but there's not that much to talk about.
The things you saw weren't part of my life, so they didn't happen to me.
What the hell are you talking about, man? Of course it was you.
I saw it.
Well, it was a Chidi, sure, but it wasn't me Chidi.
This is a classic philosophical question.
The concept of the self, or who we are.
- [scoffs] I'm so sorry.
Yeah, no, I get it.
Counterpoint that's the dumbest thing you've ever said, and you do not deserve a puppy! I'm un-blooping your puppy! - [soft beep] - [grunts] - [puppies barking] - Things are getting cuter, and I want them to get less cute! [bright music] So this is the main feed.
Every action by every human on Earth is recorded and then sent here to be assigned a point value based on the absolute moral worth of that action.
For example, a couple in Osaka, Japan, just decided to have a destination wedding.
Negative 1,200 points.
Oh, and it's a destination theme wedding.
Negative 4,300.
Ah, here's one.
This means that someone has just done something which has never been done before.
"Richard Moore of Sugarland, Texas, "hollowed out an eggplant and filled it with hot sauce and nickels.
" And amazingly, it's not a weird sex thing.
99% of all new human behaviors are weird sex things.
But not in this oh, no, it is a weird sex thing, yeah.
Well, then we zip that over to the relevant departments.
In this case, Anastasia in the Stuffed Vegetable Department.
Request denied.
I love Matty.
He's hilarious.
So they now examine the action its use of resources, the intentions behind it, its effects on others.
Correct.
And you end up with this.
And here is why tampering is impossible because this score is then double-checked by 3 billion other accountants, all chosen at random, and if they all come to the same conclusion, which they always do, it makes this official.
Anyone who does this same action in the exact same way loses this many points.
Thank you, Doris.
[whooshing] The system is flawless, and tampering is quite impossible.
I see.
Could we look at one specific file, though, just to make sure? Oh, who do you want to see Genghis Khan, Marie Antoinette? Walt Disney's got some freaky stuff in his file.
Doug Forcett.
I don't get this, man.
Why wouldn't you want to know what our life was like? You're not even a little bit curious what it was like to hit this? I don't mean this this.
Although, frankly, I would also hit this this.
Let me explain.
- [soft beep] - Take a seat.
Conceptions of the self.
Let's start with John Locke, who believed that personal identity was based on having a continued consciousness essentially, memory.
Memories are links in a chain that together form a single self.
If I can't remember what happened because it happened to a Chidi from another timeline, it's not a unified me.
Just because you don't remember doing something doesn't mean you didn't do it.
I have no idea how it happened, but there is definitely a tattoo on my butt that says "Jasom.
After all, if my brain was split in two and each half was put in a different person, which one is me? All I know is that other Chidi doesn't exist anymore, and this one does.
So this must be the real Chidi.
And all I know is that you're just barfing Wikipedia all over everyone to avoid talking about your feelings.
Let's talk about David Hume.
[Neil humming] Here we go, the Book of Dougs.
Let's have a look.
Doug Forbush, Doug Forcap Doug L.
Forcett.
Can you just tell me his total so far? Looks like he's at 520,000 points.
- Well done, Doug.
- So that's that's good? Oh, it's excellent.
Wait, he's 68 years old? Oh, that's terrible.
He's screwed.
I knew it! Doug has spent his entire life being nothing but good.
He once found a dollar on the ground, and he sent it to the Canadian government to help pay down their national debt.
And he isn't even close to getting in? How can that be? Look, mate, the points are indisputable.
" First ever act of human altruism.
Og earned 10,000 points that day.
Of course, then Grog used that rock to beat Og's brains in and lost a million points.
The point is, the math is cold, objective, and airtight, and unless you can prove otherwise, I don't know how I can help you.
I just got 700 new Weird Sex Thing files in the last one second.
Oh, yeah, Burning Man just started.
Buckle up, Matty.
It's going to be a long week.
Just admit it, man.
You're embarrassed you fell in love with an Arizona trash bag.
Eleanor, it's not personal.
Someone fell in love with you.
- It's just not me.
- [soft beep] I told you not to conjure anything.
Sorry, I-I just swapped the living room for a classroom.
Not you, him.
I was just thinking about how much fun we used to have hanging out in his broken hot tub, and then he showed up, Yeah, I was just chilling, being nothing, and then all of a sudden, I was.
- Oh! - [chuckles] Good-bye, Pillboi.
Aw, dip.
I'm not again! - [soft beep] - Oh.
You need to hurry.
My molecular essence is fragmenting, and it's giving me the worst headache.
Okay, here's a question.
If Doug Forcett's not getting in, who is? Let's look at one more file someone who who's gotten into the Good Place this year.
- No one's gotten in for a year? - Correct.
How about the last three years? All right, uh, boo-doo-doo [tense music] Uh, no one.
When was the last time someone got in? The last time someone got enough points to get into the Good Place was 521 years ago.
Michael, um Yo, homey.
You and Eleanor were fighting before, and I couldn't help but overhear.
Hey, if we hear with our ears, why is it called "butt overhearing"? Bro, if you don't like her, you should just tell her.
[sighs] It's not about whether I like Eleanor.
I got into philosophy to try to make sense of a world that almost never makes sense.
It's too much.
I'm going to tell you a story.
Back in Jacksonville, there was this guy in my 80-person dance crew named Stank Toby.
Hang on.
It was a 60-person dance crew.
Um Oh, dip! What are numbers? You're not Jason-Janet.
You're Eleanor-Janet pretending to be Jason-Janet.
That is so wrong and so confusing! What was I supposed to do, man? You wouldn't talk to me.
I'm Arizona shrimp horny.
That's not what I sound like, Jason.
- Get out of here.
- Oh, dip.
[soft beep] Look, you know what? Just forget it.
What am I even doing? I'm I'm chasing a dude who isn't into me.
I'm making myself vulnerable for no reason.
I don't even know who I am anymore! [soft beep] Uh-oh.
Gah! Stupid, Eleanor! Stupid! This whole thing sucks, you know? Eleanor, you you're not The one thing I never wanted to do, ever, for any reason, was to follow some guy around like a lame puppy dog! I mean, look at me.
I don't need to do that.
I can get any guy I want.
- Eleanor, just hang on.
- What, dude, what? - What do you want? - What is going on? - [soft beep] - Okay, well, this is bad.
Why are you staring at me? Do I have a zit on my nose or something? Your sense of self is crumbling, and it's taking the void down with it.
Great.
So I don't feel like myself for two seconds, and it breaks the universe? How come nothing went wrong when Chidi freaked out about his identity for three hours? Because freaking out about everything is my identity.
Try to do something Eleanor-y.
Laugh at someone who falls down, or show up to an event under-dressed and get mad at everyone else somehow.
I'll be right back.
[soft beep] [loud crash, crumbling] I know I asked you this before, but No, darling, this is not where the Mac and PC guys live.
Whoa! Check out this dope flat-screen! It's air-mounted! Do you see this, Tahani? This must be where Janet stores all her information.
This screen can literally show us anything that has ever happened.
Cartoons, cartoons! I think it's broken.
TV, play cartoons for Jason! [upbeat pop music playing] Oh, my.
It's not just a crush.
I think in one of the reboots, you and Janet were married.
Whoa, married? Oh.
This flat-screen must have been a wedding present.
It's all starting to make sense now.
Well, I've got to run.
We're having a little thing in the break room for Marisol's birthday.
She turning 39,000,000 again.
How dare you? Frankly, I'm beginning to resent your tone, sir.
If you've got a problem, then go to the Good Place and take it up with the Committee.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the break room, because there's cake over there, and if I don't move quickly, Erika will get the last corner piece.
Good day, sir! No, no, no.
This can't be happening.
No, he was supposed to tell us what to do.
If he's not going to fix this, who is? - You, Michael.
- [groans softly] It has to be you.
You're the only one who can fix whatever's wrong with the afterlife.
But before we get into that, Eleanor's identity is shattering inside of my void, and I might blow up.
So I'm going to need you to grab a paper clip and marbleize me, like, yesterday.
What's going to happen to the humans? No idea, but I can't take them out of my void in the middle of this office.
And if we do nothing, everyone's gone-zo.
Marbleize me, get us somewhere safe, and bring me back.
Right, a paper clip! I need a paper clip! Hey, Matt.
Do you have a paper clip? What are you going to use it for? - Chidi, I'm scared.
I'm having a hard time remembering.
Right.
Memories, you need to remember who you are.
You're Eleanor Shellstrop from Phoenix, Arizona.
Your favorite meal is shrimp scampi.
You listed your emergency contact as Britney Spears as a long-shot way of meeting her, and your favorite movie is that clip of John Travolta saying "Adele Dazeem.
" You flew halfway around the world because you wanted to be a better person, and it was very brave.
You're sharp, and you're strong.
but you also showed up in my classroom when I was drowning in despair and canned chili, and you basically saved my life.
You have very high self-esteem, and a very low tolerance for men who wear sandals, and your worst nightmare is someone saying something nice about you to your face, but too bad because I need to say it because you deserve it.
- Because because - Chidi [soft music] [both exhale deeply] [chuckles] Nice work, bud.
Did you mean everything you said, or did you just say it because the world was ending? I really want to play this cool, but I'm afraid that I'm going to ruin it if I try to be sexy.
I already ruined it.
Um, saying the word "sexy" is not sexy - Wait! - Ooh! I'm okay.
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm okay.
- Wait.
- What? They're not Janets anymore.
They're them, and they're not sitting well.
[exhales deeply] Incoming.
[whooshing] They're all here, and they're safe [alarm blaring] From the old scary thing.
Now there's a new scary thing.
Hi, guys, I'm Neil.
Welcome to Accounting.
Now, it does seem that four of you are inter-dimensional fugitives, so I did go ahead and hit the alarm sorry about that.
- Yes! Michael, what are we going to do? Guys, I'm so sorry.
- The Accountant was no help.
- Rude.
No one's gotten into the Good Place in 500 years.
We have no plan.
No one's coming to save us.
[dramatic music] So I'm going to do it.
Follow me! Corner piece! No! You can't take the Book of Dougs.
That's most of the things I've tried.
That's my guy.
Come here, come here.
- Get in the tube.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
- I love getting in stuff.
- [bell chimes] [alarm continues blaring] No way to know what happened to him.
So, come on, let's go, everyone else.
[bell chimes] [people yelling, soft whooshing] [repeated thumping] [people grunting and groaning] Ow! [all grunting] That was awesome! That was awesome! I want to go again! Where are we? We're in the Good Place.
No offense, dude, but you have told us a lot of lies in the last 300 years.
So, seriously, where the fork are we? Fork.
Shirt.
Ash hole.
[gasps] [upbeat music] Holy forking shirtballs.
We're in the Good Place!
Holy forking shirtballs.
Yeah, I don't see any go-karts, much less go-karts being driven by monkeys wearing sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts.
- What? - Don't No, this is definitely some part of the Good Place.
Just take a deep breath.
Whoa.
That smells like Typhoon Falls, my favorite water park when I was a kid.
Mmm.
Chlorine, suntan lotion, Band-Aids, and a thick cloud of teen hormones.
When I was researching my fake Neighborhood, I learned about this.
Or, no, wait.
It's the smell of absolute moral truth? Those two things have very similar smells.
I smell Blake Bortles holding the Super Bowl MVP trophy, as Dan Patrick says, "This has to feel good, Blake.
" And he says, "It sure does, Dan, and I owe it all to my best friend, Jason Mendoza.
" - Also, weed.
- Mmm.
To me it smells like a curtain closing between first class and economy.
Ah, this truly is the Good Place.
So, we're talking about mailmen now, from heaven? I literally had that calendar and I did not get past March.
- What? - Don't.
Okay, there are two key things that we have to do.
Make sure that no one can follow us.
- Janet? - On it.
What's the second thing we have to do? - Keep a low profile.
- [crashing] Okay, if there's anyone in the building, here's our cover story.
I'm an account; you are a Neutral Janet.
I'll come up with something better.
Why do we need a cover story at all? There are the good guys.
Let's just come clean and request asylum.
Yeah, man, we're refugees.
What kind of messed-up place would turn away refugees? The main thing I've learned about the Good Place is that they never break the rules.
No way to guarantee they wouldn't send you right down to the Bad Place.
What the heck is going on in there? - Uh - [clears throat] Oh, hi there.
Um, I'm I'm an accountant.
We were being chased by demons.
And a Dracula.
There was a Dracula chasing us.
- Was there, though, Jason? - Yeah.
Maybe Drac blew up the mailbox with his bazooka.
Well, jeez Louise, I'm sure glad you're okay.
My name's Gwendolyn.
Welcome to the Good Place.
It's nothing to meet you.
End of statement.
And these four here are humans, if you can believe it.
"If" I could believe it? Watch this: I believe it.
[laughs] Why are they here? Because they won a contest.
Congratulations, guys.
Come on in.
This is the correspondence center.
Ooh, this is a fun paperweight shaped like a little hat.
I'm sorry, this right here is is the door to, um, the Good Place? Well, it's a door to the Good Place, but it won't open for you guys, though.
The only door for humans is the Official Entrance, which is 500 trillion miles north-south-north of here.
So, you're kinda just stuck inside.
Wow, it's really weird that you guys won a contest to be in this building.
Well, you know, take that up with the folks at "Weird Contest Magazine.
" Hey, why don't we help you clean up the mess in the mail room? Wow, thanks.
Did I win a contest? [forced laughter] Chidi and I will be right there.
- Fine.
Ooh! - Eleanor.
- What? This is how I always got out of escape rooms.
If you break enough stuff, they open the door and kick you out.
Is everything okay in there? Yep.
Okay.
No follow-up questions.
Hey there, Smashy, before you start grabbing any other throwing lamps, you have anything - you need to talk about? - I can't take this anymore, man all the running and the hiding and fighting and this whole insane journey.
I know.
I know.
It's an insane situation, but I am right here with you.
So, let's take a deep breath.
[inhaling deeply] Mmm.
Okay, the smell of the barf from the wave pool is really helping.
How? Why? - Say, Gwendolyn.
- Hmm? I need to speak with the committee regarding an urgent matter.
How would I contact them, though, if it weren't against the rules? Well, by calling them on that phone, but I can't let you use it.
Right, and even if it weren't against the rules, I don't know the number, and you wouldn't tell me.
[chuckles] I couldn't.
There are no numbers.
You pick it up and it connects you to whomever you want, but you can't use it.
Of course not.
- Just as a hypothetical - Mm-hmm.
Is there any way that you would know if I did use the phone? - Any kind of alarm? - Golly, no.
- You said it, Gwendolyn.
- Uh-huh.
Say, is that a dog barking in another room? I doubt it, because I don't have a dog.
But out of politeness and an abundance of caution, I'll go check.
Hello, doggy.
My name is Michael, I'm an Accountant.
I need to speak with the Committee immediately, on the top floor of the Correspondence Center.
Thank you.
You know how I saw that thing about how Janet loves me? I don't know how I feel about her, and also, I feel bad that I sort of, like, read her diary.
And she doesn't know.
What should I do? Well, perhaps, you should tell Janet what you saw, and start a dialogue about your feelings.
Who knows if a relationship will take hold, but you must begin from a place of honesty.
Thanks, Tahani.
It's nice to know I can talk about girls with my wife.
Hey, Janet.
Uh, so, do you remember how you killed us and brought us into your void? I do, yes.
You saw that? That's so embarrassing.
I mean, it kind of freaked me out at first.
But, hey, let's talk about it.
I don't want to talk about this.
You guys were in my void, and it was exhausting, and I almost blew up, and I have to be neutral, and Neutral Janets don't have feelings How's it going in here? It is going neutrally.
End of conversation.
- Can can we - End of conversation.
You got one shot, buddy.
- Wow.
- This is place is very cool.
Have you guys ever been here before? - I have never been here before.
- No, no, no.
- I love it, so charming.
- Really great, it's earthy.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Michael.
It is one of the great honors of my eternal life to be invited here by you, today, for this momentous occasion.
Now, who are you, and why are we here? Well, in a nutshell, I believe that the Bad Place has somehow infiltrated the Accounting Department, and it's tampering with the points system.
My goodness, that would be a disaster.
Everyone focus up.
Meg, you take notes.
Daisuke, open a secure channel to headquarters.
Kellen, head to the farmer's market and grab us fresh peaches.
I think pluots are in season.
We're gonna be here a while.
Brought you some water.
Well, I mean, there's not a kitchen, but I found this kind of glowing bowl with liquid in it? Maybe it was a toilet.
I'm gonna throw this out.
What are you doing? Trying to jimmy the lock, but everything I stick in here just turns to glitter.
- Ugh.
- All right, forget about the door.
Look at me.
Compared to some of the other stuff that's happened to us, it could be worse.
I guess "try and enjoy this" is a better plan than "have the anxiety sweats.
" Oh, check it out straight through my sweatshirt.
Cool.
Hey.
I have an idea to take your mind off the door.
Let's go on a date.
- What? - No, I'm serious.
Well, there've been dips before.
Remember like, 200,000 years ago, when they invented stabbing, and they were all just, like, stabbing each other? Again, I urge you to look at Doug Forcett.
The man has lived a selfless life, and he's not even close to getting in.
The only explanation is that the Bad Place has somehow rigged the system.
I wouldn't put it past them.
Every single Bad Place employee is a disgusting monster.
Well, some of 'em are probably cool, handsome, man-about-town types.
Committee, Michael the Accountant has brought us evidence of a problem, and now it is up to us to find a solution.
You are such a good speaker.
This suit is very flattering.
You have a lot of gravitas.
I thought I was gonna be annoyed by this, but it's it's wonderful.
Your jawline is extraordinary.
You're a nice height.
Your energy is electric.
I gotta say, it's been really nice having a little company.
So, how'd you two meet? Was it through the contest? Tahani and I met in brain school, and then we got married, because nothing mattered.
You're both so attractive.
Are all humans as attractive as you two? [laughs] No.
Fantastic.
Say, Jason, can you help me get more wicker baskets - from the other room? - Sure thing.
I'm so sorry, darling, this is all my fault.
I encouraged Jason to come clean about what we saw.
You saw that too? - No.
What if they come out my butt? [bright music] Whoa, champagne.
Found it in the cupboard.
I think it was a gift.
I feel kind of bad, what if it was for something really important? "Gwendolyn: Here's some champagne for you "for thanking me for thanking you "for thanking me for thanking you for thanking me for the champagne you sent me.
" Pop that bench.
[pops] This is my kind of scrappy fun, sneaking around with a boy, trying not to get caught.
I know, it's like when my parents would go to a symposium and I would sneak into their office and read the unabridged dictionary.
I can't believe I'm attracted to you.
You blew it when you admitted it to me.
You still thinking about what's on the other side of that door? Not really, no.
Because you're here with me on this side.
I have one more little surprise for you.
Okay, open 'em.
Holy forking fork.
What do you think? Oh, no, you're crying.
I assume it's because you're happy or horny.
You look amazing.
And this sucks, and I'm furious, and I'm the happiest I've ever been, and I blame you.
In light of this new information, the time has come to take decisive action.
Wow, can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that.
We are gonna form an elite investigative team to get to the bottom of this.
And we are fast-tracking the process.
It'll take no more than 400 years.
Sorry? It's aggressive, but you heard right.
Like, right now.
Michael, we have rules, procedures.
We're the good guys.
We can't just do stuff.
No.
Upon formation, the team will then be in charge of organizing a Blue Ribbon Commission to investigate themselves, to make sure there's no conflicts of interest.
And that will take 1,000 years.
Okay.
Have you seen the memoranda we've sent each other about how concerned we are? We're taking this very seriously.
Hear, hear.
Kellan, did you file a "Hear, Hear" memorandum? No.
Sincerest apologies.
I rescind my "Hear, hear" and resign, effective immediately.
[applause] Hey, you two.
I think I may have solved one part of our little problem.
I made up a "Death Did Us Part" certificate, explaining that since Jason and I are dead, we are officially no longer fake-married.
It's a nice gesture.
I feel both pitied and put on the spot, so that's fun.
And it's a cool reminder of how I'm dead.
Well, forget it.
Never mind.
Misfire.
Watch this.
There, cancelled.
- It's okay.
- [whimpering] Cry as long as you want.
I'm going to.
[sniffling] 'Cause my tears taste like the nacho cheese from my favorite movie theater.
That's a really weird incentive to keep crying.
Relationships are stupid.
You're scared you're never gonna have a real one, and then when you do, you're scared it's gonna go away.
Here's an idea, what if we don't worry about whatever comes next? There's a quote a I like by Tolstoy: "There is only one time that is important: Now.
An unverified Tyra Banks account posted that meme on Instagram.
Well, now I hate it.
[laughs] There is another quote first spoken by a very wise, very attractive, occasionally very sweaty philosopher: "You gotta try.
" Now, she was talking about making the world a better place, but I think it applies to relationships too.
I've got an idea of something we could try.
Great.
What? Oh.
Wait, I I think I know Well, I don't wanna assume.
The Titanic is sinking, and they're writing a strongly-worded letter to the iceberg.
How much more evidence do they need? The Bad Place has to be tampering with the system.
There's no other explanation.
Can I ask you an unrelated question? Absolutely not.
The fate of all of humanity is at stake, and time is running out.
[somber music] Go ahead.
I'm trying to help Jason and Janet navigate some very complex feelings, but everything I do makes it worse.
You know them better than anyone else.
But every time I do something nice, it backfires.
There are so many unintended consequences to well-intentioned actions.
Feels like a game you can't win.
That's it.
There is another explanation: unintended consequences.
Oh, Tahani, you did it.
Well, of course I did, darling.
Did what? All along, I've only been looking at one Doug, but there's millions of Dougs in here.
- [bleeping] - Now Yeah, here we go.
[bleeping] In 2009, Doug Ewing of Scaggsville, Maryland, also gave his grandmother a dozen roses, but he lost four points.
Why? Because he ordered roses using a cell phone that was made in a sweatshop.
The flowers were grown with toxic pesticides, picked by exploited migrant workers, delivered from thousands of miles away, which created a massive carbon footprint, and his money went to a billionaire racist CEO who sends his female employees pictures of his genitals.
Whoo! That is a very odd thing to cheer.
Don't you understand? The Bad Place isn't tampering with points; they don't have to.
Because every day the world gets a little more complicated, and being a good person gets a little harder.
Gather the others.
Janet, I owe you an apology.
I'm very sorry I meddled.
Truly, I was only trying to help, because I want you two to be happy.
And because, well, I love you.
I really do.
I love you both.
- [sniffles] - Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
- Why are you crying? - I don't know.
I'm British, I I never cry.
But you're saying these nice things about me, and it's making me cry.
And also, this is less important, but the carpeting is really disgusting.
[crying] [wailing] Why are you crying? I just like being a part of things.
[crying] Two humans and a Neutral Janet crying? In the Good Place? I've never been suspicious of anyone, but I think that's about to change.
Oh, no reason to be suspicious, I promise you, we've done nothing untoward.
What's up, fart-faces? Chidi and I just had sex in a closet.
I have no choice, I have to turn you in to the Judge.
Don't bother, I already did.
[twinkling] Hey, Frogman.
The Judge agreed to your terms.
She'll meet you at IHOP.
So, this is the Good Place, huh? [sniffing] Smells like frogs.
Cool.
Let's go.
No, not tight.
The Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes is the most dangerous place in the universe.
Then why are we going? - To save humanity.
- Great.
Any chance I could change real quick? - Nope.
- Cool.
[dramatic music] Bye, guys.
Nice to meet you.
It's the crossroads of all dimensions like Grand Central Station but for space and time.
If you eat anything in this IHOP, you will literally explode.
Yeah, I know.
It's IHOP.
Why are we meeting there? The Judge's powers are limited in the IHOP, so she can't just retire me on the spot.
And I believe that when she hears what I've discovered about the points system, she'll take our side.
If not, then we'll jump through a portal to another dimension, hope our molecules don't liquefy, and regroup from there.
Excuse me.
Hey, so Yeah, so I don't want to go in there.
I get that.
Come here.
Here are your options.
Option number one [screams] Cruel but necessary.
[screams] Oh, look at this.
They added a tenth dimension.
- [all yelping] - [laughing] Boy.
I know exactly what's going on.
We all smoked too much salvia.
We got to ride this out for about two, three minutes, and then we'll be back in Pillboi's broken hot tub, and this will all be over.
Hey, is is this a good time to talk? Well, there's no time like the present.
And here there's neither "no time" nor "the present.
" [giggles] Go ahead.
So you know how me and you used to be married when I was dead before? Mm-hmm.
I think I'm starting to catch feelings again for you.
But, yes, I'd very much like to go on a date with you somewhere sometime, as opposed to here, which is nowhere at all the times.
- [both chuckle] - You get it? Yeah.
Hey! Butthead! You lie to my face, disrespect my orders, steal the only key to Earth, meddle with an already compromised timeline, kidnap the humans into a Janets' void, and now demand a meeting in the freakin' IHOP? I hate this place! I wouldn't have asked for a meet if it weren't vitally important.
And I promise, no more rule-breaking.
[mockingly] Oh, yeah, really? Cool.
'Cause it kind of looks like you stole a book from Accounting! No more rule-breaking starting now.
Ugh.
Hello, Chidi.
Sorry.
What is on me right now? Oops.
Where'd you come from, little buddy? No, don't touch it! Tahani, do not touch the Neednoggle.
- What? - Bad.
This is all bad.
[scoffs] Humans are such whiners.
Here, hot pants, let me take care of it for you.
Help.
Everybody, you're all still standing in the IHOP.
The Judge simply augmented your reality to make you feel like you're in a normal IHOP.
Very smart.
Don't suck up to me, you suck-up.
This is far better.
Instead of a slug creature, I have a cute little scarf.
- No! No! - No, no, no! Don't touch it! Tahani, that's still the Neednoggle.
The Judge just made it look like a scarf.
Why don't we all sit down so I can fill the Judge in on what we've learned? Your Honor, I once stood in front of you and said I thought there was something wrong with the points system.
I finally know what it is.
Life now is so complicated, it's impossible for anyone to be good enough for the Good Place.
I know you don't like to learn too much about life on Earth to remain impartial, but these days just buying a tomato at a grocery store means that you are unwittingly supporting toxic pesticides, exploiting labor, contributing to global warming.
Humans think that they're making one choice, but they're actually making dozens of choices they don't even know they're making.
Your big revelation is life is complicated? That's not a revelation.
That's a divorced woman's throw pillow.
I mean, this guy chose this tomato.
Buy another tomato.
What else you got? Um I'll tell you what else I got, uh I got this.
Michael.
What what are you doing? The Backpack Kid dance.
- Why? - I don't know.
It makes people happy.
Is it helping? Can I say something? Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote Boring! [grunts] I got this.
I want to tell you about a guy from my dance crew in Jacksonville called Big Noodle.
I used to yell at Big Noodle 'cause he always showed up late to rehearsal.
Then one day, the swamp under my house flooded.
I needed a place to crash, so I slept at Big Noodle's house.
Turns out that he had to juggle three jobs to take care of four grandparents who all lived in the same bed just like in "Willy Wonka.
" I never yelled at Big Noodle for being late after that 'cause I knew how hard it was for him to be there.
And he definitely didn't have time to research what tomatoes to buy.
Even if he wanted to, possession of a non-fried vegetable is a felony in Jacksonville.
The point is, you can't judge humans 'cause you don't know what we go through.
Maybe you should give it a shot.
If you still don't see things our way, then we'll drop it, and you can you know, zappy, zappy, marble, marble.
Yeah, sure.
I'll give it a shot.
I'll go down there.
See what you guys go through.
And then one way or another, this is going to end.
Hey, do you guys know a good place where I can get Mexican food? Oh [scoffs] Mexico.
- [sighs] How long will she be gone? No way to tell.
Uh, my guess is Oh, brother.
That was rough.
- Right? - Sheesh.
Earth is a mess, y'all.
Woof! Also, I guess I'm black? And they do not like black ladies down there.
Crap, y'all.
This is bad.
The only place I liked was Hawaii, although I barely left the resort.
The last place I went was a Black Friday sale at an outlet mall in Michigan.
- Why? - For the deals.
Earth stinks, y'all.
It's hot, and it's crowded but somehow also cold and lonely.
I thought it was going to be so easy to make good decisions.
The first thing I did was I Googled "big, juicy natural tomatoes," which led me to a porn site that was for people with a sunburn fetish or I kind of never recovered.
Right.
Problem number two even if you do somehow manage to make good decisions, you still lose points because of the unintended consequences.
Yeah, there are booby traps everywhere.
Like, there's this chicken sandwich that if you eat it, it means you hate gay people.
And it's delicious.
It is.
It is so good.
And I essentially tried to do what you suggested.
I obsessed over every choice.
Oh, no, you are nobody's problem, sweetheart.
[sighs] You know, we got to figure this out.
And then Turtle makes a bet with Ronda Rousey, and if she loses, she has to Oh, come on.
I was just in the middle of torturing William Shakespeare by describing the plot to the "Entourage" movie.
What is this? Some new information has come to my attention, and I need a solution.
I want the Bad Place to weigh in on this.
But first, let's have a change of scenery.
[all yelp] Remember, guys, we're still in the IHOP, so be careful.
The prosecution rests.
Got to say, that's a solid rebuttal.
Look, there are plenty of awful people and thoughtless jerks, and, I guess Nazis again, somehow.
But there are also people who are really trying to be good, and they aren't getting close.
Because they're not good at being good because they're bad.
The score they got on Earth is how good or bad they are full stop, end of story.
Then why did these four get better over and over again in my Neighborhood? Why did they help each other in ways they had never helped anyone on Earth? I don't know.
Maybe it's a fluke.
That's it.
I know what we have to Aah! Oh.
He forgot we're still in the IHOP.
Anybody got eyes on Chidi? [high-pitched voice] Help! Help! Can someone grab my tiny boyfriend, please? I'm on it.
And got him.
Ah.
Here you go.
Ah! Ha! [breathing heavily] I I just saw a trillion different realities folding onto each other like thin sheets of metal, forming a single blade.
- Let's get back on track, bud.
- Oh, okay, sure.
What I was saying, um, before, you know I saw the Time-Knife? Is this Michael is right.
His Neighborhood gave us the chance to become better people because it removed all the variables that make life on Earth hard.
Yeah, uh, there was no rent to pay, no racism, no sexism.
No awards-show gift-suite publicist infighting.
What? Those gift suites can be a real minefield.
But Shawn is also right.
It's what Simone taught us about data collection.
Try it again and see if you get the same results.
Of course! I build a new Neighborhood.
We choose four new people, tell them they're in the Good Place, create challenges for them, track their progress.
My guess is they will do what the original four did.
Seek help, support each other, make wise decisions, improve.
If they do, then it's proof that humans are not "bad, full stop, end of story.
" This is so stupid.
- Ooh.
I have an idea.
Hi, Mindy.
We need to use your backyard.
You need my backyard? For what? We're conducting an important experiment Okay, you know what? I don't care.
In fact, as soon as I started asking the question, I thought to myself, "Why are you asking this? You don't care about the answer.
" Do whatever you want.
Just leave me out of it.
Who's Derek? Don't think of Derek as my ex-boyfriend.
I made him, so he's more like my son.
Although I did make him because I was jealous of you and Tahani, so he's kind of my rebound booty call.
So he's your son-rebound-booty-call.
Fine, if you want to put labels on it, I guess he's my son-rebound-booty-call.
But he doesn't mean anything to me.
Also, Derek never really worked right.
He's a buffoon.
I didn't see you there.
I was just reciting some Edgar Allan Poe.
Hi.
I'm Derek.
Welcome to the Medium Place.
[gurgling] Derek, why are you so different? You have Mindy to thank for that.
See, she found a plunger sticking out of the ground behind our house, and every time she hits it, I pass out.
When I come to, I'm a little bit smarter and a little bit better.
How many times has Mindy rebooted you? I don't know.
Half a million.
- What? - She reboots me a lot.
Sometimes when she's bored or just needs some "alone time.
" Sometimes just for laughs.
[laughing] Derek.
- Shall we head inside? - Okay.
Cool.
The Bad Place gets to choose the four new humans.
But they have to be the same general level of badness as the original four, all right? No serial killers, no dictators, no one who managed a boy band.
Michael will not get the files in advance, so he does not have forever to plan.
But he can then change the Neighborhood however he wants.
Yeah, I have about a billion objections to this.
- So do I.
- Good.
That means it's a fair compromise.
I say we get them from the Good Place.
Over my dead skin suit.
Well, what other option do we have? Would anybody like a Medium snack? I myself will be enjoying another classy martini.
Don't mind if I do.
[gasps] I can make the people.
Just like I made Derek.
- Are you sure? - Yes.
If the Judge restores my powers in the Medium Place, I can do it.
- None taken.
Okay, the other residents will be comprised of Janet babies.
You will have one year of Earth time to try to improve the humans.
I will be monitoring everything to ensure there's no cheating and to track the humans' progress.
Deal? - [electric buzzing] - [grunting] - Ow! - [chuckling] - Classic.
- Ha ha! - [electric buzzing] - Ow! - Janet? - Hi, there.
- Ah.
- Ready to start building? - Yes.
- Yes.
I'm so glad you're here, Janet.
- Me too.
- All right, so [clears throat] What's your first basic idea? [beep] Perfect.
So basic.
[both laugh] [peaceful music] This house was built to torture you.
Why did you have Michael re-create it exactly? Well, in the memories I watched, this was where we fell in love.
So I figured, why mess with success? I mean, blegh, what am I saying? This house is stupid.
This is gonna be fun.
I mean, I know we have to help these new people, but most of the time, we'll just get to live together like a normal couple.
We can chill out and just relax - and study philosophy - Have sex.
Horndog.
Nerd! [straining] [beep] Hi, I'm Daphne.
Hi, Daphne, I'm Janet.
I made you.
Great.
Bye.
Okay, Daphne's done.
Only another 185 people to go.
I'll check back in an hour.
- You're doing so good, Janet.
- Thanks, Jason.
- Making people is exhausting.
- [beep] Can't help but notice you're making a bunch of people.
Janet doesn't need your help, dude.
Actually, it would go a lot faster.
- Thanks, Derek.
- No problem.
- [beep] - Don't worry.
This is purely professional, okay? Now, be a pal and hold my classy martini while I get down to business.
Let's make people.
[phone ringing] Hello, Your Honor.
Just wanted to wish you bad luck.
Trying to psyche me out? You must be scared.
Oh, I'm very confident.
I think we've picked some excellent subjects for your stupid experiment.
When you fail, and you will, I've got something special cooked up for your four little friends.
Let me guess, they're gonna be tortured with penis-flatteners and bees with teeth.
You are so predictable.
Why don't you at least switch it up once in a while? Try using teeth-flatteners and bees with penises.
When you fail, the four humans will be tortured for all eternity.
But guess who's going to be doing the torturing? Hello, idiot.
[chuckling] We built a Michael suit.
The boys down in R&D said it couldn't be done.
So I made it out of them.
That's Vicky in there right now, taking you for a spin.
You are disgusting.
- Disgusting-ah.
I invented those.
That was me.
Well, I will just tell them what you're going to do, and they'll know that it isn't really me.
And we'll erase their memories of you telling them.
Thanks for inventing that little trick, by the way.
Very useful.
Have fun, Michael.
Enjoy everything that is about to overwhelm you.
Just a little jittery.
Last time I designed a Neighborhood, things didn't really go according to plan.
Eh, plans are for wimps.
We should have done this Shellstrop-style don't prepare at all, get drunk the morning of the test, BS our way through it, and then brag about how we didn't even study an still got a C-plus.
- [chuckling] - So what do we got, man? I got to go give everyone a heads-up, remember? Uh, his name is John.
Um, some sort of journalist.
No major crimes or atrocities.
- Is he out there right now? - Mm-hmm.
Jeez, Louise.
Well, you have to be prepared for anything.
I mean, is John coming in thinking that he belongs, or does he know he definitely doesn't? Dude, dude, relax.
All we have to do today is tell John he's in the Good Place, show him around the Neighborhood, and get him to Tahani's welcome party.
That's it.
We can deal with the rest later.
- Right? - Right.
- Right, right, right.
Your friends will always trust you.
[beep] - Okay.
Here I go.
- Okay.
I'm gonna Yep.
Here I go.
I go here.
And - I'm gone.
I can't do this.
Hello? Is anyone here? Michael, buddy, John is awake.
- We need to open the door - Mm-hmm.
And welcome him into the afterlife.
Remember, the whole plan? I do remember.
That's why I can't do it.
It's just too scary.
Oh [whimpering] No [knock at door] Hello?
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
No! [KNOCKING] Hello? Okay, listen.
There's a guy out there who's awake and doesn't know what's happening, okay? You gotta pull it together.
You've got this.
No, I absolutely do not.
I'm not meant for any of this, Eleanor.
- I'm just middle management! - [SHUSHES] What if I fail? It'll be like the failure to end all failures.
It'll be an epic fail.
She'll understand.
[KNOCKING] Anyone? Uh, okay, Michael.
Listen.
You can do this.
You are Michael.
You are smart and capable.
And you're a fearless leader.
And you are gonna take a deep breath, stand up, open that door and say, "Hi, John.
Come on in.
" Got it? [QUIRKY MUSIC] Hi, John.
I'm Eleanor.
I'm the Architect.
Come on in.
[UPLIFTING MUSIC] So, let me sum this up for you, John.
- Ya dead.
- What? But don't worry, it's okay that you're dead, because you, John Wheaton, are in the Good Place.
Yes.
That's what I thought.
Wow, John, what a life you've led.
Sorry, did I introduce Michael? [LAUGHS SOFTLY] He's my assistant.
Hi.
He just transferred over here from Dog heaven, so, you know, he's still getting used to people.
What do you say I show you around the neighborhood? So are you, like, an angel or something? Oh, John, aren't you sweet? Enough about me.
So, everything you see is here for you to enjoy for eternity, you and your 321 neighbors.
Yep, that is certainly information that I already knew.
Janet is a walking database of all the knowledge in the universe, and since you, John, seem to like asking a relentless number of questions, go ahead.
Ask her anything.
Okay, um, what's the craziest secret celebrity hook up? Drake and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on and off for years.
Okay, wow.
Wait, so you really do know everything? Kinda seems like she should be running the neighborhood.
Yes, John, in retrospect, that does seem like a much better idea.
Hey, Janet, why don't you take John inside to get some froyo? We'll catch up with you later.
- Guys.
- Guys, guys, guys.
- Uh-oh.
Michael looks like me.
That's bad.
Fun little update.
Michael was feeling a bit overwhelmed.
So, new plan.
Well, if I could pick anyone to impersonate an immortal deity, well, it would be me, but if it couldn't be me, it'd be you.
Yeah, you're gonna rock this.
You're like the Blake Bortles of whatever's going on right now.
- I'm not really sure.
- Thanks, guys.
I think I can be the Architect.
I saw how Michael ran the neighborhood in the memories he showed me and there was, like, a four-year period where Brad Pitt really wanted everyone to know how into Architecture he was, and I read a lot of those interviews, so I think that might help me.
And before long, Michael will be back to his old self and he can step in and take over, right? Look at the four of you all together.
That's okay.
Chidi, have Janet translate the gibberish of these files.
Tahani, continue working on the welcome party.
Oh, yes, the party.
So, for the napkins, I would normally do a queen's tuck, but I was thinking of shaking things up a bit with a Yorkshire butterfly.
And this could not matter less.
Very sorry.
- Good-bye.
Like, this whole box is just one trip to Wendy's.
Well, keep reading.
According to Michael, I usually asked for your help by, like, day two, so you need to be ready.
You know what? At first, I was kinda nervous.
But so far, I think I'm doing okay.
It's like I became such a good person I almost forgot I'm a world-class liar, baby.
Very fun thing to hear from your girlfriend.
You're doing great, and I have to admit, you being the Architect is kinda hot.
So, same.
Same.
All right, I gotta get ready for the next person.
Well then, I will say good-bye to you platonically the same way a resident would say good-bye to an Architect.
Eleanor, what if John had seen us? I'm scared, and yet somehow turned on? Scared is the best way to be horny.
[GASPS] Oh, now who's doing the teaching? - [CLIPBOARD SMACKS] - Hey, now, all right.
A little higher.
Thank you.
I used to write about you all the time on my blog.
"The Gossip Toilet.
" We were the ones that invented the Olsen twins countdown clock for when they became legal.
That was our blog.
That was us.
[LAUGHS] Oh, my.
You were quite mean to me.
Oh, no.
That's like the nip slip of dying [LAUGHS] Okay, listen.
We're gonna catch up later.
I can't wait to hear all about your new nose.
Oh, no.
I didn't get a nose job.
Oh, I know, I just figured we're in heaven so we might as well fix all of our flaws, right? Like, look at me.
Nothing is staying on this face.
- [LAUGHS] Gosh.
Yeah, we know, babe.
What's wrong? I know John rather, he knows me.
He's a gossip columnist who tortured me on Earth.
He made it seem like I was shallow, plagued with jealousy, and prone to fits of melodrama.
- What are you saying? - Don't you see? The Bad Place didn't pick the worst people.
They picked the people who would be the worst for us.
Of course.
How did I not anticipate this? Shawn didn't just choose a bunch of serial killers.
[FOREBODING MUSIC] Those motherforkers.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC] This is insane and obviously against the rules.
Yeah, too bad it's not, dill hole.
She'll remember them.
It's going to destroy the integrity of the experiment, Your Honor.
Plus, now I have to live next to a man who once lied and said I wasn't at Diddy's White Party.
I was there, Eleanor.
I was.
Your Honor, you never stipulated that we couldn't choose people who had some sort of connection to them.
And Simone just happened to die on Earth, which was really, really cool [CHUCKLES] You wanna know how it happened, Chidi? It's hilarious.
- No! - Okay, here's my ruling.
It's not against the rules for the four new humans to have connections to the original four.
- Simone and John can stay.
- Booyah.
But it was kind of a dirty trick, so Michael can erase Simone's memory to the point before she met any of you.
Fine.
Eat butt, you ding dongs.
[MAGICAL CHIMING] Okay, okay.
Focus, team.
Michael and I will prep for Simone.
Tahani, keep an eye on John.
Jason, talk to no one.
Go nowhere.
- Do nothing.
- Are you okay? - I no.
Very obviously, no.
Look, you could spend 100 years in this neighborhood before you even run into Simone.
It'll be easy to avoid her.
No, no, but we don't want me to avoid her.
The whole plan is that I'm supposed to help them learn ethics so they can improve.
Okay, okay.
We can deal with that later.
That's step one? [UNEASY MUSIC] - Janet? - Hi, there.
Give me your opinion.
Is this a savage insult? "Nice shirt.
Who designed it? Marc Fake-obs?" For people in your social class, that is 84% savage.
Although there is a 29% chance he responds, "Oh, honey," in a tone so devastating you will think of it every day for the rest of time.
I like those odds.
I'll go lay it on him now.
No.
I shan't let it happen.
John, I'm happy you're here with me.
This is going to be good for both of us, and I look forward to putting the past behind us and becoming your friend.
Oh, my God.
You are so cute.
You are so cute, it's gross.
You disgust me.
I love you.
I love you so much.
[SIGHS] Hi, Simone.
I'm Eleanor.
Come on in.
So, as a neuroscientist, are you surprised there's an afterlife? I am, frankly.
I mean, there's a decent chance this entire thing is just a complex electrochemical reaction caused by my synapses randomly firing in the millisecond after my death.
But this fro-yo is amazing, so I'm just gonna roll with it.
What flavor did you get? I got a twist half strawberry, half male-coworker-gets-called- out-for-stealing-your-ideas.
- Hi.
- Mmm, hi.
Wow, all the other residents seem so nice.
- The residents are great, yes.
- [CLEARS THROAT] But, uh, don't feel like you need to get to know all of them right away.
Maybe just talk to Michael and me for the first I dunno, 6,000 years or so.
Anyway, you just chill, baby girl.
We'll check in with you later.
I think this new dynamic may actually be good.
You know, it gives me more time to observe and plan.
You'll be the face of the operation and I'll be the mastermind behind the scenes, like Cyrano De Bergerac.
Like, Kris Jenner.
Oh! Totally.
Yeah, I think this is gonna be okay.
- Yeah.
- No, it won't.
- We're not rebooting you.
- Shawn was right.
Bringing Simone to this neighborhood, it's checkmate.
It completely neutralizes me.
I'll be too freaked out to help the new residents.
The only way to outflank Shawn is to make it so I don't remember Simone.
So, you have to run into your ex occasionally.
That's a part of life, man.
I might slip up and reveal something.
Look, this isn't just about me feeling awkward around my ex.
It's more about, if I am awkward around my ex, everyone gets tortured forever.
No, there has to be another way.
Oh, I've got it.
Just remove Simone from Chidi's memory and keep everything else.
- Boom.
- It doesn't work that way.
Guys, I've thought about this from every angle.
If we don't wipe my memory, I will, one way or the other, ruin the experiment.
- You know I'm right.
- No.
No, man.
It can't be, because if we erase your memory all the way back to before you met Simone, that includes Australia and the study and the Soul Squad and everything.
- That would be erasing - Us.
I know.
Tahani, the welcome party will be tomorrow night.
Next time you see me, it'll be like I'm a new resident.
I won't know any of you.
So, will you remember that time in Australia when we stayed up late and we ate pizza together? No, buddy, I won't.
Will you remember when we ordered the pizza? No.
Will you remember pizza? Will I remember what pizza is? Yeah.
I'll still know what pizza is.
- Okay, so not a total loss.
I haven't met a more perfect couple since I set up Drake with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Yes, we will no longer be together.
The Bad Place has pulled off the most intricate cork blork of all time.
Hmm, it's a nice touch that the cursing filter maintains the rhyme.
I appreciate that attention to detail.
Hang on.
I'm not giving up yet.
Let's have an old-fashioned brainstorming session.
" Michael, if there was another choice, we'd choose it.
Believe me.
You like learning about humans, right? This is a classic human situation.
Your friends are going through something awful, and there is nothing you can do about it.
Anyway, let's just rip the Band-Aid off.
Snappy, snappy, wipey, wipey.
I need a few minutes to work it all out, so [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [DOOR CLICKS] I hate this.
And I'm sorry.
This is why people love moral philosophy professors.
[LAUGHS SOFTLY] Well, how about this? Every time you see me get a stomach ache, imagine I'm thinking of you.
So, all the time? Exactly.
Sorry to interrupt.
I wanted to give both of you something before we do this.
Think of it as a going-away present.
[MAGICAL TWINKLING] - - [PROJECTOR CLICKING SOFTLY] [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SNIFFS] I don't normally cry at movies [SCOFFS] But that one was pretty good [SNIFFS] That girl was hot.
The guy was, too.
That's what's so scary about this whole thing.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're just gonna think I'm some sexy godlike figure who you wanna hump immediately after meeting her.
I know you're deflecting by making jokes about how hot you are.
It's not a joke.
I'm a legit snack.
- But I believe in you.
- [SNIFFS] I am not even scared to get rebooted because I know that you'll be here, taking care of me.
Jeremy Bearimy, baby.
We'll just get through this.
And then you and I can chill out in the dot of the eye forever.
Right.
We'll be okay.
We found each other before hundreds of times.
We can do it again.
[SIGHS] Bye, Chidi.
Can you just, you know, like, tell me the answer? Sorry? You know, the answer to everything.
You know all there is to know in the universe.
Crunch the numbers.
Tell me the answer.
What's the point of love if it's just gonna disappear? And how is it worse to not love anybody? There has to be meaning to existence, otherwise the universe is just made of pain, and I don't like the thought of that, so tell me the answer.
I know how you feel.
Back on Earth, I had to watch Jason have no recognition of me.
It felt like right before someone pushes a plunger and murders you.
But that's part of the fun, right? What do you mean? If there were an answer I could give you to how the universe works, it wouldn't be special.
It would just be machinery fulfilling its cosmic design.
It would just be a big, dumb food processor.
But since nothing seems to make sense, when you find something or someone that does, it's euphoria.
In all this randomness and this pandemonium, you and Chidi found each other, and you had a life together.
Isn't that remarkable? Pandemonium is from "Paradise Lost.
" Milton called the center of hell, "Pandemonium," meaning, "place of all demons.
" Chidi tricked me into reading "Paradise Lost" by telling me Satan was, and I quote, "my type.
- Oh, no.
That's very on brand for you.
[MELLOW MUSIC] I guess all I can do is embrace the pandemonium, find happiness in the unique insanity of being here, now.
We'll do this together.
In the words of the man that I love, "I got you, dog.
" - Thanks, Janet.
- Mmm.
You know, for a robot, you make a really good girl friend.
[SOFT BEEP] Okay.
[GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] Hi, Chidi.
I'm Eleanor.
Come on in.
Hi, Tahani! How are you?
Hi Tahani! We want to go to the movies on Saturday. Wanna hang out together?Hi, how are you doing?
I'm fine.
How about yourself?
I'm pretty good.
Thanks for asking.
No problem.
So how have you been?
I've been good.
I'm in school right now.
What school do you go to?
I go to PCC.
Do you like it there?
It's okay.
It's a really big campus.
Good luck with school.
I'm doing well.
How about you?
Never better, thanks.
So how have you been lately?
I've actually been pretty good.
You?
I'm actually in school right now.
Which school do you attend?
It's not bad.
There are a lot of people there.
Good luck with that.
Thanks.
How are you doing today?
I'm doing great.
What about you?
I'm absolutely lovely, thank you.
How about yourself?
I started school recently.
Where are you going to school?
I'm going to PCC.
How do you like it so far?
I like it so far.
My classes are pretty good right now.
I wish you luck.
I know. I think it may rain.
It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be.
I really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
Me too. I can't wait until winter.
Me too.
It doesn't look very nice outside today.
You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining.
It's too hot.
That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.
I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.
That's exactly how I feel
I wish it was a nicer day today.
That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
Winter is great.
I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
I feel the same way.
It's such a nice day.
Yes, it is.
Why is that?
I really love how rain clears the air.
Me too.
It always smells so fresh after it rains.
Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.
Really?
Why is it?
Because you can see the stars perfectly.
Isn't it a nice day?
It really is.
It seems that it may rain today.
Hopefully it will.
How come?
I feel the same way.
It smells so good after it rains.
I especially love the night air when it rains.
The stars look so much closer after it rains.
I really want it to rain today.
Yeah, so do I.
Don't you think it's nice out?
Yes, I think so too.
I think that it's going to rain.
I hope that it does rain.
You like the rain?
I understand.
Rain does make it smell cleaner.
I love most how it is at night after it rains.
How come?
You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
I would love for it to rain today.
I would too.
I really want to go to the beach this weekend.
I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
Is it going to be perfect beach weather?
I believe so.
Good.
I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
I know.
I really want to go to the beach.
But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.
I really wish the weather would just stay the same.
I do too.
That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.
A trip to the beach would be fun.
How is the weather going to be?
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
I really hope it doesn't get cold.
That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.
The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.
That is true.
The weather is constantly changing.
It would be nice if the weather would never change.
That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.
True.
What's the weather going to be like?
I may want to go too.
The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
Will it be good beach weather?
I think it will be.
I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm.
This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen.
I know.
That would make it easier for us to make plans.
I know.
Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.
Hello, may I speak to Alice please?
This is she.
How's it going?
I've been trying to call you all day.
Sorry about that.
So what were you calling me about?
Oh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.
Sure, what did you want to do?
Maybe we can go see a movie or something.
That sounds like fun.
Let's do it.
I'll see you tomorrow then.
See you then. Goodbye.
Speaking.
What's up?
Why haven't you answered the phone?
My bad, I had chores to do.
That's all right.
What was the reason for your call?
I want to do something tomorrow with you.
Sounds good.
Okay, let's go see a movie.
Until then.
Talk to you later
Is Alice available?
You're talking to her.
I've called you a hundred times today.
I was busy doing something.
I apologize.
Do you want to do something tomorrow?
Is there somewhere special you wanted to go?
How about a movie?
A movie sounds good.
Call me tomorrow then.
I will see you tomorrow.
Have you seen the new girl in school?
No, I haven't.
She's not too tall.
Well, how tall is she?
She's about five feet even.
What does she look like, though?
She has pretty light brown eyes.
I may know which girl you're talking about.
So you have seen her around?
Yes, I have.
I think that she is very pretty.
Tell me how she looks.
She's kind of short.
What height is she?
She's probably about five feet.
That's nice, but tell me what she looks like.
The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.
I think I might've bumped into her before.
Have you met the new girl?
No. Have you?
She's one of the prettiest girls at the school.
What does she look like?
Well, she's quite short.
How tall would you say that she is?
I would say she's only five feet.
What about her facial features?
Have you seen her?
I think that I have.
Why weren't you at school yesterday?
I wasn't really feeling well.
What was wrong with you?
My stomach was upset.
Do you feel better now?
I don't really feel too well yet.
I already took some medicine.
I hope you feel better.
Thank you.
What reason do you have for missing school?
I was sick.
How were you sick?
I had a stomachache.
Did it get any better?
I took something earlier.
Get better.
Thanks a lot.
Why didn't you go to school yesterday?
I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well.
What was your problem?
My stomach was bothering me.
Are you feeling any better?
That's okay.
I hope you feel better.
I'd appreciate that.
Did you hear the good news?
No, I haven't.
I got a promotion at my job.
Did you really?
Seriously, I am so excited.
I'm so happy for you.
Really?
Yes.
You really deserved this.
You think so?
Yes.
Good for you.
Have you heard my good news?
Is that right?
It's the truth.
I am really happy.
Congratulations on your promotion.
Thank you very much.
I am really excited for you.
Are you really?
I'm serious.
Yes, I do.
I haven't told you what happened yet, have I?
I haven't heard anything.
My boss offered me a promotion, and I took it.
Are you serious?
Yes, I am really excited.
That's great.
Congratulations.
For real?
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion.
I really do.
You look really nice today.
Thank you.
I just got this outfit the other day.
Really, where did you get it?
I got it from Macy's.
Thank you. I just got these shoes today.
Really?
What kind of shoes are they?
These are called All Star Chuck Taylors.
I really like those. How much did they cost?
They were about forty dollars.
I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair.
I absolutely love what you're wearing today.
Seriously, it looks really nice on you.
Where did you buy it from?
I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall.
I really like that outfit.
Thanks.
I think you look nice today, too.
Thank you.
I just bought these new shoes earlier today.
These are some Chucks.
Those are great.
How much were they?
I got them for forty.
I think I might go and find me my own pair of Chucks.
I think that you look very cute today.
Is that right?
This is a brand new outfit.
I love your outfit right now.
Well, I think you look nice today too.
Thanks.
I found these new shoes earlier at the store.
I think that those are some really nice shoes. What kind are they?
These are Chucks.
Your shoes look really nice.
How much did you get them for?
Tell me, what do you enjoy doing in your spare time?
I enjoy drawing and painting.
You know how to draw and paint?
Yes, I do.
When did you learn how to do that?
I learned back in high school.
Oh, so you took an art class?
Yeah, I loved that class.
I wish I had a talent like that.
I'm sure you have a talent.
It's just hidden.
What kinds of things do you like to do?
I've always liked to draw and paint.
I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint.
I do it every once in a while.
How long have you known how to do that?
That was my favorite class.
You have got to be talented.
Thanks.
If only I was talented.
You have a talent.
You just don't know what it is yet.
Are there any hobbies you do?
When I have time, I sometimes draw and paint.
Did you always know how to draw and paint?
I was taught in high school how to draw and paint.
You had an art class?
Exactly, it was my favorite class.
Well, it's good that you're so talented.
I appreciate that.
Talent is a great thing, I wish I had one.
Everyone has a talent.
My favorite movie is Superbad.
Oh, why is that?
It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen.
That's true.
It is a very funny movie.
You've seen it before?
Yes, I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters.
Didn't you laugh through the whole movie?
That movie brought tears to my eyes.
Mine too.
I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it.
Sure, let's go.
Which movie is your favorite to watch?
I have to say, my favorite movie is Superbad.
Is that right?
Why?
I didn't think you saw that movie.
I went to see it the day it came out.
I was laughing through the whole movie.
I couldn't help laughing, either.
Same here.
I bought the movie. Would you like to come to my house and watch it?
Of course.
Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?
Well, Superbad is super funny.
You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious.
I didn't know that you saw Superbad before.
I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.
I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.
I was laughing hysterically the whole time; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards.
That's exactly how I felt.
I got the movie when it came out on DVD, do you want to come over?
I like listening to different kinds of music.
Like what, for instance?
I enjoy Rock and R&B.
Why is that?
I like the different instruments that they use.
That's a good reason to like something.
Yeah, I think so too.
What kind of music do you enjoy listening to?
I like to listen to Rock and R&B.
Why do you like that type of music?
I like the kinds of instruments that they use.
I think that's an excellent reason to like something.
Thanks, I feel the same way.
What is your favorite kind of music?
I listen to various types of music.
What genres?
I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use.
That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music.
That's exactly what I think too.
Did you go to the basketball game on Friday?
No, I couldn't make it.
You missed a really good game.
Oh, really?
Who won?
Too bad I was busy.
I really wanted to go.
Yeah, you should have.
It was really exciting.
So what was the score?
The score was 101-98.
Man, that was a really close game.
That's what made it so great.
I was unable to make it.
You should have been there.
It was intense.
Is that right.
Who ended up winning?
Our team was victorious.
I wish I was free that night.
I'm kind of mad that I didn't go.
Our team won 101-98.
Sounds like it was a close game.
That's the reason it was such a great game.
The next game, I will definitely be there.
I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday.
I wanted to go, but I couldn't.
It was a great game.
It's too bad that I couldn't make it. Who won?
It was the best game ever.
So tell me the final score.
The other team lost by three points, 101-98.
It must've been a close game.
It really was.
You should've gone.
Hopefully, I'll make it to the next one.
What are you doing this weekend?
I'm not sure yet.
Well, did you want to go see a movie with me?
What movie are you going to see?
I'm not sure yet.
Is there something you want to see?
There's nothing I can think of.
So, did you want to go?
No, thanks, maybe another time.
I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine.
What about you?
I don't know.
Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?
Do you know what movie you're going to watch?
I don't know, but was there a certain movie you wanted to see?
None that I can think of.
Well, would you like to go?
You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend?
I'm going to the movie theater with my friend.
What are you going to do?
I'm not quite sure yet.
How about you see a movie with me and my friend?
What movie are you and your friend planning on watching?
Not sure.
Is there a movie out that catches your eye?
No, thanks.
Maybe another time.
For sure another day.
Did you go to school today?
Yeah, I went to school today.
Were you there?
No, I didn't go, I've been sick.
That sucks. Did you want the assignments from English class?
I will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick.
Well, thank you. I hope to see you at school tomorrow.
Have you attended school today?
I attended school today. Did you?
I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Would you like the assignments from English class?
I would really appreciate that, thanks.
Thanks.
See you at school tomorrow if you feel better.
Have you gone to school today?
I went to school today.
Did you go to school?
I couldn't go to school today, I was sick.
That's horrible. I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class.
Thank you very much, that's kind of you.
That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow.
Did you hear the news?
What happened?
Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.
She did?
Why didn't anyone tell me?
I would've thought that somebody would have told you.
No, I had no idea.
Are you going to go and visit her and the baby?
I think that I might.
Good!
I just thought I'd let you know.
Thanks for telling me.
Have you heard what happened?
Heard what?
Debrah already had her baby.
I honestly didn't know.
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
That's good to hear.
Will you go and visit them?
Of course I will.
I just wanted to give you the good news.
Thanks for letting me know.
Have you heard the news?
Nobody told me.
I thought you heard.
I really wasn't told anything.
She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces.
Wow, how exciting.
I know, you should really go and see her and the baby.
Of course I will.
I just wanted to let you know what happened.
Of course.
Did you?
I didn't want to, so I didn't.
That's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently?
That's a switch.
I'm serious, have you?
No, I haven't.
Why?
I really don't want to go by myself.
Well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?
No, I think I'm going to go to the movies.
Did you make it to school today?
I always do. Did you go to school today?
No, I didn't.
You should have, but have you seen any movies lately?
That was an odd change of subject.
I want to go to see a movie this weekend.
What's stopping you then?
I don't want to go alone.
So, will you be at school tomorrow?
No, I want to go to the movies instead
Did you even bother to go to school today?
Yeah, I went. Did you go?
No, I didn't feel like it.
It may have been random, but have you?
I haven't lately.
I would love to catch a movie this weekend.
So then, why don't you just go?
I don't want to see a movie by myself.
Okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?
I think I might just go to the movies.
Thanks for coming to see me today.
Why haven't you tried to come see me then?
I've been really busy.
Doing what?
Working.
I would've come to see you sooner, but I've been busy too.
What have you been doing?
I've been working too.
Well regardless, I'm very happy that you came to see me.
I had to.
I was missing you a lot.
I was missing you too.
So, why haven't you visited me?
I've actually been busy lately.
What have you been doing?
I've just been working really hard.
I've also been busy.
Well whatever, I'm glad you came.
So am I.
I'm really happy that you came to visit me.
I really missed you a lot.
I've been missing you like crazy.
I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.
Lately, I've been quite busy.
Tell me what you've been up to.
So what have you been up to?
I've just been working a lot.
Whatever the reason may be, I'm glad you visited me.
I'm glad I did too.
Hey, did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend?
Yeah, but I'm still waiting for my invitation.
Oh really?
She gave me mine earlier today.
I think so.
It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.
It really does, I can't wait.
What time does the party start?
It starts at 8 o'clock.
Oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?
I'm not sure, but I don't think she's given out that many.
Well, hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today.
Really?
I got mine from her this morning.
I'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow.
You're probably right, do you intend on going to the party?
I want to.
I heard it's going to be really fun.
I know, it does sound pretty awesome.
Well, when does the party start?
I really don't know, but I don't think she gave out that many yet.
I really want to go, so I hope that she gives me my invite soon.
Has anyone told you about Jessica's party coming up?
I was told about it already.
I'm just waiting for my invitation.
Is that right?
I already got my invitation from her earlier.
I believe that she will give me the invitation today.
Exactly, it seems like it's going to be loads of fun.
When exactly does the party start?
The invitation says it starts at 8:00 p.m.
Has she given out a lot of invitations yet?
I have no idea, she hasn't given out many though.
I'm planning on going, but I really need her to give me my invitation
Hey, what's up?
Nothing really.
You didn't?
Nobody has told me anything about your party.
Did you want to go?
When does it start?
At 8:00 p.m.
I'll be there.
I'd better see you there.
Of course.
I'm having a party this Friday.
I had no idea.
Is that right?
I didn't hear anything about it.
Can you go?
What time?
It starts at 8 o'clock.
I'll go.
What's going on?
Not much.
This Friday, I'm throwing a party.
Oh really?
I didn't know that.
Are you serious?
I haven't heard anything about it.
Can you make it?
Yeah, I think I'll go.
Am I going to see you there?
You will.
What's going on?
Nothing really, you?
I'm throwing a party next Saturday.
Is that right?
Yeah, are you going to come?
I don't really want to.
Well, why don't you?
I hate going to parties.
Well, that's okay.
Yeah, sorry.
What's up?
Nothing, how about you?
Next Saturday, I'm going to have a party.
Probably not.
Why is that?
I don't feel like going.
Why not?
I really can't stand going to parties.
I understand, I guess.
Sorry about that
What's happening?
That's nice.
Are you going to be there?
I don't think so.
Is there a reason why?
I just really don't want to go.
How come?
I don't really like parties.
I wish you would go, but that's okay.
Nothing much, what's going on?
I'm having a party this Friday.
Oh, really?
That's nice.
I wanted to see if you wanted to come.
This Friday?
Sorry, I already have plans.
Doing what?
Yeah, maybe next time.
I'll hold you to that.
Sounds like a plan.
Hey, what's good with you?
Not a lot.
What about you?
I'm throwing a party on Friday.
That sounds like fun.
I'm already doing something this Friday.
What are you going to be doing?
My family and I are going to dinner.
I was hoping you would come.
I'll definitely try to make it the next time.
I'd better see you there.
All right. I'll see you next time
What's going on?
Well, that's cool.
Will you be able to make it?
I'm busy this Friday. I'm sorry.
What do you have to do?
I'm having dinner with my family
Maybe you can come next time.
I'll make sure and come to your next party.
I'll look for you at my next party.
Why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
I really have to go.
Why? I still wanted to talk to you.
I have things to do.
Like what?
Don't be nosey.
I'm not. I just want to know.
Well, it's really none of your business.
Fine.
I've enjoyed conversing with you.
Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?
I've got to go.
I wasn't done talking to you.
I have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey.
I'm not being nosey. I'm just asking.
I really don't think it's any of your business.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
What's the rush?
I have to get off the phone now.
I'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
There are other things I need to take care of.
What is it that you need to do?
Please don't be nosey.
That was mean to say.
I am very sorry, but I must go.
I guess.
Well, it was nice talking to you.
It was nice talking to you too.
We should really hang out again.
That would be fun.
Where do you want to go?
All right, so I'll see you then.
I'll call you later.
Okay, I'll talk to you later then.
See you later.
Bye.
I enjoyed talking to you.
I enjoyed talking to you too.
We should hang out some time.
Do you want to go out to eat?
I'd like that.
So I'll see you next time.
I'm going to call you soon.
I'll talk to you later.
See you soon.
Goodbye
I had fun talking to you.
That should be loads of fun.

Would you like to go to dinner or something?
Yeah, let's do that.
Okay, until next time then.
I'll call you so we can set that up.
Talk to you then.
All right, see you.
That should be no problem.

I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.
We can certainly do that.
Expect a call from us at 7:00, and then again at 7:15.
Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7:30 am?
I can certainly do that.
Is there anything else?
I can't think of anything.
If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call again.
Okay.
Of course.
When would you like the call?
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
No problem.
We'll give you both calls.
Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7:30.
No problem.
Anything else, sir?
Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow?
Certainly.
What time would you like us to call you?
I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
Not a problem.
We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7:15.
On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of 7:15.
Said, and done.
Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with
Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.
Not a problem.
 What time shall we call you?
I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
It'll be our pleasure.
We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.
Oops, cancel that.
Can I help you with anything else?
No, that's about it for now.
Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening
I need a wake-up call tomorrow.
What time would you like your wake-up call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
That is no problem at all, of course.
You'll get a call at 7:00, and another at 7:15.
So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30.
Do you have any other requests?
Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.
Okay, sir. Sleep well.
I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call.
Of course.
We can give you a call anytime you like.
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.
Wait a minute!
I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it.
Change it to 7:30.
The second call is now changed to 7:30.
Is there anything else we can help you with?
Nothing that I can think of right now.
If something comes up, though, I'll call you.
We're here all night long if you need anything
[theme song playing in Spanish] Okay, Carl, - your blood pressure looks good.
- [machine beeps] Now we're gonna do the thing where I ask you some basic health questions and you lie to me.
Okay? Alcoholic beverages per week? Two, maybe three.
Why you lying to me, Carl? Would you also like to lie to me about smoking? I stopped smoking.
Carl, the mouthwash works, but the shirt smells like Virginia Slims? They make my hands look bigger.
I'm not gonna write that down on the chart.
Dr.
But you're wearing army clothes.
Yes, I know.
The camouflage look was all the rage in Afghanistan.
You went to Afghanistan for Christmas.
I'ma give you a sec.
- Oh! - There you go! - Let me ask you - No, I never killed anyone.
Yes, it was hot over there.
You're welcome for my service.
But any anyways, we're separated.
So, you're single.
[chuckles] Yeah.
Actually, I was just about to go home and make dinner for my kids.
Single mom.
Well, this was fun.
Alex.
Alex, help.
Thank you.
Next time I'll Skype you.
We have a problem.
I know.
The hipsters have discovered Porto's.
Line around the block is like the freakin' Apple Store now.
Mom! And this one, I don't like her anymore.
I don't care if you like me.
What? Why? We already booked the room, and I found a great band! Okay, it's a deejay.
Okay, it's your brother with an iPod and a playlist, but it's a very good playlist.
I researched the history of quinceaÃ±eras and found out they're totally misogynistic.
She's been reading again.
Why do you let her read? I know, Mami.
I let her do math, too.
I'm a monster.
By the way, they made me captain of the debate team today at school, but all she wants to talk about is this.
I was 12, I was in gym, and ironically, it happened in first period.
You are throwing away your Cuban heritage.
Yeah, the bad part.
I don't want to be paraded around in front of the men of the village like a piece of property to be traded for two cows and a goat.
Someone thinks they're worth a lot.
What century do you two think you're in? I mean, Elena, relax.
It's just a fun party.
You know, I'll have a little too much wine, embarrass you while I sob during my toast, uh, Abuelita will dance inappropriately with one of your guy friends You can count on it.
What does that even mean? It means that you do not know enough Spanish to know that I'm insulting you.
Oye [speaking Spanish] - Ha! - [speaking Spanish] - [laughs] - Abuelita [in English] I'll learn more Spanish when you learn English.
I know the English.
Besides, your abuelo, God rest his soul, did not marry me for my mind.
Who do you think you're insulting? Good one, Mom.
By the way, what are the last 16 digits of your credit card? Uh, what are you doing? Are you shopping? 'Cause who said you could shop? You said I could order sneakers for school.
[laughs] Five pairs? Monday through Friday.
Don't worry, I don't need weekend sneakers.
Mom, I'm serious.
I'm in middle school now.
How I look kinda matters.
Okay, so you can buy one pair for under $40.
Forty? That'll get you perfectly good sneakers to last the whole year.
The whole year? Okay, Mom, I know we're not rich, but are we poor? No, we're fine.
- That sounds like poor.
- We're not poor! I mean, look around! We have a TV, a refrigerator.
We have an air conditioner.
You never let us turn it on.
The point is you could, but don't.
Don't ever touch that thing.
All right, it's Friday night.
Family dinner time.
Come on, let's go! Elena, come set the table! Alex, help me make a salad.
This meat was heavily discounted, so I need to cook it before it turns.
Mami, I told you this morning that I was gonna cook tonight.
I thought it was a joke! And I thought it was hilarious.
Sorry, Mom.
Do you want us to sit and watch you eat? No.
[chuckles] We'll just start next Friday.
- Okay? - Okay.
- All right.
- Sounds good.
- Okay.
- [pipes groaning] Oh, yeah, that's not working.
Don't worry, I told Schneider.
Here's some hand sanitizer.
And here - I don't need lipstick.
- Yes, you do.
Okay.
You know how much I appreciate your help, but you have to let me establish my own traditions.
Ay, Mami, ya! I don't wanna force her.
You know, this is all on me now.
I wanna handle it right.
You know a father would make sure that his little girl had a quinces.
You really wanna go there? 'Cause I'm holding a hammer.
I'm just saying, maybe when Victor comes back, you can work it out.
Remember when we all moved in together and you said, "If you ever want me to go away, just say, 'Go away.
'" Yeah.
I feel like it says, "I mean business.
" Yes, if your business is taming lions.
Oh, wait! I have one more.
You're 40 and you look stupid.
[sighs] I knew it! [groans] [laughs] What? Is That's fake? Yeah, I'm not gonna grow a real one until I know if people like it.
And I'll have you know, I was invited to several pride parades.
Please tell me you're here to fix my sink.
Yeah, fine! - Ooh, that's a cool hammer.
Ah, so we've got two fancy tools up in here.
No, come on.
Come on! No.
You know you're the only non-Latino I trust to fix stuff.
Oh, is that racist? Oh, who cares, it's just us.
[chuckles] - [speaks Spanish] - [in English] Yeah, don't do that.
I regretted it as soon as I said it.
It's no problem.
What's your mom cookin'? You've really been eating here a lot lately.
Yeah, I like it, too.
Can you believe it's only been 10 months since you moved in? I remember 'cause I got my five year sober chip and your mom baked me that cake.
Oh, I remember, yeah.
I'm sorry it was a rum cake.
I enjoyed watching you guys eat it.
Oh, by the way looks like you accidentally threw these out.
- I found 'em in the trash.
Hey listen, you can tell me anything.
There's a landlord-tenant confidentiality clause in your lease.
No, there isn't.
Okay, there's not, but I really wanna know what's going on! Fine.
They're anti-depressants that Dr.
Berkowitz thought I might need, but he doesn't know what he's talking about, so Yeah, it sounds like he really cares about you.
What a dick! I don't need them, and I have to get them out of here because if my mom finds 'em, it'll be, [inhales deeply] [imitates Lydia] "Ay, Dios mÃ­o, she's a junkie like the Amy Winehouser.
" Yeah, so, I will, uh I'll just get that washer and we'll get that thing fixed right up.
[laughs] Oh, you shave out your mustache.
- What, you liked it? - Oh, yes.
It made me laugh.
Elena! [speaks Spanish] - [in English] Come out here, honey.
- What's up, Abuelita? Okay, listen, uh [clears throat] I know you got issues with the quinces, but - All right - No, no, no.
No, no.
- [sighs] - But I am going to show you something that I think might change your mind.
This could be you.
Burn it! Oh, hey! The quinceaÃ±era.
You're doing it! Elena, I knew you'd come around.
She didn't! She thinks she's being sold into slavery.
That's not really part of it, right? You know what? Let me talk to her.
[grunts] I've been doing some outreach down at the rec center, talking to at-risk youth.
No, I don't think you should do that.
Hey, girl.
How you livin'? Your abuela wants to throw you a sick kick-back on a Saturday night.
I got this.
You know what, Captain Debater? Let's debate this.
But we're not doing a regular debate.
It's gotta be that thing I saw you do where we argue the opposite side to better understand each other.
You mean a Lincoln-Douglas debate? My specialty? I once successfully argued against gravity, so Ooh, I'ma take my earrings off 'cause it's about to go down! [grunting playfully] [Elena clears throat] The issue before us is quinces or no quinces.
Okay so I'm you.
[imitates Penelope] Mmm, listen kid! A quinces is just about the village celebrating that you're a woman, which I know you know 'cause you're the smartest one in the family! [laughs] Oh, I got better moves than that, right? [all] Eh But village isn't literal.
It just means your family and your friends.
Oh, my money's on her.
[chuckles] You guys wanna start takin' bets? Actually, scratch that.
I'm addicted to gambling.
Okay, now I'll be you.
[imitates Elena] Oh, my God! Do you even hear yourself? Seriously! Your argument is that my adulthood has to be approved by your friends? Pass! Well, I'm not gonna clap for that.
[in Spanish accent] So you want to crush my heart into pieces after I worked so hard to give you an opportunity in this land of the free and home of the brave? That's not me, that's her.
You make me sound like I have an accent.
[clears throat] Let's end this.
Jesus and Santa were cousins.
Everybody knows this.
So, when it comes to your quinces I'm pleading with you.
Can't you do this one thing for your mother who loves you? Okay, Mom, I'll do it.
[all gasp] Wait, what? I'm saying, you win! You should have a quinces like you just proved.
[all laughing] Dang! Mami set you up! I didn't realize how right I was.
She said a bunch of stuff I didn't even think of! [laughs] Mami, [speaks Spanish].
Okay, this was stupid! I'm still not having a quinces.
It's what we do.
[speaking Spanish] - [screams] - [door slams] [in English] She can speak Spanish.
Mrs.
Doyle is in exam room three and I swear to God, if that vieja calls me Maria one more time Mrs.
Doyle has Alzheimer's.
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
Hey, I'm messin' with ya.
She's just racist.
She wouldn't talk to me all weekend.
Oh, don't worry.
It gets better.
Eventually they leave.
[groans] It's just all on me now.
Oh, yeah, every move you make is fraught with peril.
Is this gonna be the one that scars them for life? And in my case, the answer was always yes.
Well, it's just a lot of pressure and sometimes I don't know.
It's fine! There's just a lot going on right now.
But it's more than that, right? You were talking to me about nightmares I know what I said.
Look, if if you had something wrong with your heart, and I gave you some medicine, you would take it.
So why wouldn't you do the same with this? Yeah.
But to be fair, I probably wouldn't take that heart crap either.
[chuckles] I mean, as a nurse, I would totally recommend it, but as a Cuban, I suffer in silence.
A silent Cuban? Hey, I'd like to meet one of those.
[laughing] - And she's a teenager, right? - Right.
- Oh, yeah.
Alex ordered some sneakers for school.
I get an alert every time a package is delivered.
[cell phone chimes repeatedly] How many feet does that kid have? Hey, so, for the quinces, is there any way I can get a plus three? Currently in a bit of a lady-juggling situation.
No, I promised you to Consuelo.
[laughs] Now, she has a good mustache.
Just kidding.
[laughs] It's not that good.
- I can explain.
- [Penelope] Really? You can explain how one pair of sneakers magically became five? Because that is some Jesus crap right there.
Sorry I said Jesus so close to the word crap.
Mom, this family's been through a lot, and I felt like I needed to provide because I'm the man of the house now.
Oh, that's why you bought five pairs of sneakers? That's why I bought no pairs of sneakers.
Oh, he's into magic now? [laughs] Can I be your assistant? [laughs] No, I will become the focus.
Free returns, Mom.
I can order any pair I want, wear them a couple of times.
No, it's not.
Alex, there's no way you can keep all these sneakers - clean enough to send back.
- Oh, no? Oh, so, it's six pairs of shoes? Okay, what about the bottoms? You've been walking around all day.
Oh, you're right, Mom.
I mean, you gotta get him on Shark Tank or something.
No.
No, this ends now.
It's like you're stealing.
I said one new pair.
You disobeyed me.
Now, you get no new pairs.
No, you know what? Now, you get Elena's old sparkly ones.
With the multicultural princesses? No! Lucky for you, she never wore them 'cause they were too gender-specific.
She did like that they were diverse.
I'm not wearing those.
I still don't understand why I can't buy these.
- [sighs] - Let me talk to him.
- Hey, little man Okay.
- Out! Yes, your papi gives me money, but it's for the basics, and it's not a lot.
But he's absolutely doing his best, and he will always be your papi.
But make no mistake, when it comes to money, I'm your daddy.
Tomorrow, these all go back.
- Everything okay? - [sighs] I need you to sign my test.
Yes, everything is fine.
I know.
This is social studies.
You love this! Yeah.
I guess I didn't try because I don't need an education now that I'm gonna be chattel.
And without schoolwork, I have more time to plan my magical quinces.
So [sighs] Ay.
Okay.
Enough.
You know how hard I bust my ass, by myself, to send you to that school so that you can have more opportunities than I did.
Then you you pull this crap? I can't even look at you right now.
Just go to your room.
You keep saying that you want me to be this strong, independent woman like you.
And then, when I tell you that I don't want to be a part of something that I think is a misogynist cultural ritual, you tell me to shut up, do it anyway.
[scoffs] So which is it, Mom? Lupita, are you okay? Ah, you're like me.
You get upset and you clean.
Wait, wait a minute.
That is your answer? Drugs? Okay, open your mouth and spit it in my hand.
I haven't even taken it yet! And it's okay, Mom.
It's something that helps.
But do you even see everything that's happening now? You don't need drugs.
You need your husband.
Oh, God, stop it! Stop.
Victor is not the answer.
I know you didn't want him to go back to Afghanistan, but he's making money.
We live in America, name one! It's not just the job, and you know that! - It's not like he cheated on you.
- It's not the only thing that matters.
We are Cuban.
We don't get divorced, we die.
Don't you think I miss him? You think I like being alone? I wanted to do this with somebody.
That was the plan.
Family dinners, and inside jokes, and one of the kids says something cute, and you share a look.
And even right now to be able to say, "Okay, they're insane, we're not.
Someone someone in your bed.
You know, since Victor's gone, I don't sleep.
Because he used to spoon me to sleep.
So, yeah, Mom I miss the good stuff.
Sometimes you just need somebody to give you a hug and say, "I got you.
" I meant a man.
I am very strong.
I've been doing my yoga.
The ladies be looking at your feet.
Something's wrong.
Am I right? I'm sorry.
Nah, I think I can make these work.
Or, I noticed you bought a pair for under 40 bucks, which means you did the right thing before you did the many, many wrong things.
Really? Oh, thank you! I was trying to be brave, but even the nuns would've made fun of me.
Listen, you don't have to worry about being the man of the house.
First of all, we don't have a house, so there's that.
Ah! [laughs] Puberty's gonna hit you like a train.
Hey.
Hello.
So there's been a lot of yelling.
Okay, it was mostly me.
But I hear you and you don't have to have a quinces.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't test me.
Okay.
Look, I get the whole misogynist thing.
I do.
But I hate to tell you lots of good stuff has started for dumb man reasons.
Yeah, like, marriage used to be a way to pay off debts.
Plus, women were being raped everywhere, so you'd marry your daughter off to some guy and say, "Okay, he owns her now.
No raping this one.
I can assemble a rifle in 13 seconds.
I'm a total badass.
How are you missing this? [chuckles] I'm sorry, it's just a lot of times you sound like a mom.
Yeah, well, I am one.
And there is a part of me that buys into that cheesy "my little girl is becoming a woman" thing, because you're not a little girl anymore.
That is super weird.
[sighs] If I'm being honest with myself, I was making your quinces about me.
I guess I wanted people to show up and say, "Look at the amazing single mom pulling it all together by herself.
It's not dumb.
They're dumb.
- Who? - The people.
No, there's no people, that's just a thing that I said.
No, I'll do it.
All I wanted was a good reason why, and you just gave me one.
Oh, my God, really? [laughing] That is so great! We'll we'll do the whole thing.
The ceremony, the stupid waltz.
Okay, now I feel like I should talk you out of it.
[chuckles] Yeah, but I won't.
I won't.
Your abuelita, she can be a broken record, but she taught me life can be tough.
So when you get something to celebrate, you take it.
Then take photos.
Photos I'll use to scare your children.
Oh, I'm not having children.
What? What are you doing here? - I'm going to spoon you.
- No.
- Yes, move over.
- Mami, no! - Okay, shh! - No! - You're gonna like this.
It's very nice.
- No, don't do it.
- Oh, yes, see? See? - [sighs] [both] Mmm.
Ay! Oh! Oh, no.
You are not at war.
You are home.
You are safe.
Everything is okay.
- Okay? - Okay.
Except, I'm 38 years old sleeping with my mom.
And what is wrong with that? Are you wearing makeup? Of course! What if I got up in the middle of the night and I ran into someone? Like you might barge in on Julio Iglesias in the bathroom? You don't know where Julio spends his time.
And I need to look nice in case I die in my sleep.
I know.
You've been telling me since I was five.
- Don't let them make me up like a puta! - them make me up like a puta! And my shade is Scarlet Sunrise.
Okay, I'm gonna go make breakfast.
This is a good thing.
Don't give me that look, bitch.
That's two.
That's three! Oh, my God, five? What's going on in there? The first one was for pee.
Yeah, and it worked.
Ay, it's impossible to be Zen in this house.
You know, it's bad enough that you take 40-minute showers.
I have to use water to get ready.
Every time I show up at school, there are all these eyes expecting perfection.
And you give it to them, papito.
Easy.
It's setting.
Okay, everybody.
Let's go.
I can't be late.
We're having one of our staff meetings at work.
Aren't there only four of you? And yet, we take attendance.
But I've actually got some good stuff to talk about today, so hopefully I can get through it without being interrupted by Scott, the freakin' bobo.
You know, I know bobo is an insult, but it sounds adorable.
- Like he's a little clown.
But I'm a professional.
So when he starts pulling his crap, I am gonna smile, I'm gonna nod but inside, I'm gonna be like Don't worry, I got this.
I spent all week preparing this badass spreadsheet and I'm gonna make it rain informative data.
Ooh, I have a lot going on today, too.
They're implementing my composting initiative in the cafeteria.
I wish I could make you this excited about a comb.
Our school's waste stream will really shrink if we let the food decompose naturally.
And once I'm able to introduce worms triple the excretions.
Yes, she does, right? Okay! Staff meeting, everybody.
Staff meeting.
First things first.
- Lori.
- Here.
Okay.
Penelope.
Here.
Halfway there.
Scott.
Dr.
Berkowitz.
- Okay, any new business? - Yes! Turns out, I've been wearing the wrong bra size.
My whole life! Great.
That's that's that's great.
Anything about the office? Yes, yes.
Oh, that's not good.
Well, if we stagger our appointments by just five minutes, we could decrease wait time, while still maintaining an excellent level of patient-doctor Actually, it sounds like the patients won't get the same amount of time with Dr.
B that they've come to expect.
Well, they'd have more time with him, if, if Actually, in today's medical industry, it's important we don't sacrifice human interaction just for the sake of expediency.
Actually Scott, I've been involved in today's medical industry even longer than you And it's easy to get burned out? I get it.
Boy, such great contributions today.
Aw, thank you.
All I'm saying is, there's a reason this guy's been running the office this way for so long.
- Okay, but there is a - Great! Status quo it is.
All right, meeting adjourned.
Thank you, everybody.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right, Doc? Oh.
- Oh, my God, is that how Cubans clap? - You don't wanna find out.
I have a salsa emergency.
The condiment or the dance? I am equipped for both.
There's this girl Lola.
- Uh-huh.
- Do you think you could show me a couple moves you Wow, you're amazing! I know.
Now, salsa is just, "You want me.
You can't have me.
You want me! No, you can't have me!" Now take me in your arms like a man.
Huh.
See, I consider myself a feminist, so I don't know Oh, that kinda man.
Got it.
Move those hips.
Feel the music! Show me something.
So you are in love with this girl? Ho, ho, yikes! Slow down.
I'm not in love with her.
Love isn't even real.
It's just something your nanny says sometimes to your dad.
The first moment I saw my Berto, a lightning bolt went through me and I saw my future.
The next 40 years went by as quickly as that first night.
We hooked up at a barbecue.
Okay! It's time to dance.
Churning the bottle, churning the bottle.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Â¡SÃ­! Take my leg, bruto.
Ugh, I get it, we're Cuban! AzÃºcar! Can you believe this living stereotype? I know.
It's Uh-oh.
Oh, my God, what's happening? Oh, it's happening.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I think it's my hot Cuban blood! Oh, I must dance! Whoo! - Come on! - Hey! - Come on, now! Whoo! - What? Okay, I'm dizzy.
I had a crazy annoying day.
It couldn't have been as bad as mine.
At lunch, no one scraped their food into the new composting bins.
Even when I stood in front of the trash cans.
Zach Miller hit her with a hamburger.
What? No! He threw it in the wrong bin and I deflected it with my face.
No one was listening to me! So she started screaming and calling everyone, "Earth murderers.
" Look, Elena, I get it, 'cause it's in me, too.
But that's why you and me, we gotta watch it.
You know, like today, I barely got a word in before el bobo started interrupting me, talking over me.
I couldn't even get my point across.
Well, that's just sexist.
No.
He's not smacking me on the ass and going, "Oye, mamita!" Oh, that makes me miss your abuelo.
You wanna see real sexism? Be a woman in the Army, okay? You got a 22-year-old white boy from South Carolina marching behind you going, "Is it hot out here or is it you?" Of course, it was hot out there.
It was a freaking desert.
I would prefer to die.
Yo no entiendo cÃ³mo these men and women all want to be the same.
We should celebrate our differences.
I would never trade these for that.
Mami.
No, no, I agree with her.
Everybody wants to see those.
Nobody wants to see this.
- Okay.
- It's much more subtle now.
Men assert their power through microaggressions and mansplaining.
Oh, mansplaining.
Is that like manscaping? I just learned that and I love it.
No, mansplaining is when a It's when a man explains something to a woman that she already knows, but he acts like he's teaching her.
Does that make sense? What? I was just explaining what mansplaining Oh, wow! Elena, microaggressions and all this little crap If I got bent out of shape every time a man said something stupid, you wouldn't be here.
Mom! This is a real problem.
Talk as long as you want.
Not that you need my permission.
I'm just You know what? I'd like to hear from the ladies.
Women.
Females.
You guys Not guys, humans.
Wow, you broke Schneider.
Mom this stuff might not seem like a big deal, but it chips away at you.
You will never win men over by confronting them.
You flirt with them.
You hypnotize them.
And then you do whatever the hell you want.
And then they will think they are the boss, but really, you are the boss.
Why can't they just know you're the boss? Oh, no, they would be so upset.
That is horrifying.
Oh, sÃ­? Well, nobody ever threw a hamburger in my face.
Oh! What are you doing? I was thinking that if you would wear a little makeup, you would look presentable and maybe the people in school would listen to your garbage ideas.
How would that help? Lawyers would love to wear sweatpants, but they wear suits so the judge will take them seriously.
- Go on.
- Really? So makeup makes you beautiful.
Beauty gives you power, and that is why I never let anyone see me without it.
I just realized, my whole life I've never seen you without makeup.
Yes, you have.
My baby pictures.
But mija, por favor won't you just try it my way, huh? I like what you said about power, so, all right, I'll give it a try.
Ah! Gracias! Wonderful news.
Elena can be in the Christmas card this year.
Oh, you look very nice.
Thank you.
- I meant her.
- What? She didn't do anything.
What? Nothing.
You just look different.
What is this? Wear-your-grandma-to-work day? I'm kidding! You look great.
And whatever this is, good luck with it.
Well, what are you gonna do about Scott, the bobo? Nothing, because he doesn't matter.
I'm going straight to Dr.
Berkowitz.
Then I'll accomplish my goal, and Scott's burgundy-red Buick Regal, license plate 374 PCE will remain unharmed.
- Just a little more rouge.
Oh, gracias.
Yeah, thank you so much.
Have a nice day.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you about my waiting room ideas - from the meeting yesterday.
- Hey, we have a waiting room full of patients out there who are very unhappy.
Sounds like there's a problem that a badass spreadsheet could've fixed.
When my dogs are upset, I rub their bellies.
Should I There's gotta be something we could do.
- Boom! Okay.
I am not trying to turn this into an argument, but I said the same thing yesterday and nobody listened.
I don't think that's exactly what you said.
No, that's exactly what I said, Scott.
But maybe you didn't hear, because you were on your phone like now.
Uh, what? Yo voy a matar este hombre.
Huh? What does that mean? I'm just thinking about lunch.
I'm hungry.
I do.
Okay, uh, Scott Sometimes I've noticed, when I'm talking, you don't listen.
I've let it go, but now I'm saying something professional in a professional manner professionally.
I think what Penelope's trying to say Oh, my God! Stop saying what I am trying to say, you mansplaining, microaggressive, bobo cabrÃ³n! You're sexist, and I'm tired of letting it go! Does that make sense? Okay, lot of big feelings and a fertile area for what is now our biannual staff meeting.
Hold up, Doc.
You think I'm sexist? That's crazy.
I love women.
It's got nothing to do with love.
Yeah, you better be waving at someone you know.
Guys, guys! Let's keep our anger where it belongs, with the patients! I don't know what you're complaining about.
If anything, I'm the victim of reverse sexism.
What? I'm in a traditionally female-dominated profession, and if I had to diagnose what's happening, you're jealous because I'm killing it.
Oh, my God! That's insane! Okay, don't get hysterical.
Okay, you see that! That right there, that is sexist! You would never say that to Dr.
Berkowitz.
That's 'cause Dr.
I do everything around here, okay? I order office supplies, I call insurance companies, I even make the stupid coffee because yours sucks and Lori always burns herself.
It never looks hot.
How about all the times you take off early for your kids' appointments and I'm left to pick up the slack, because moms are special? What did you say? Uh-oh! I dropped my pen.
Scott, could you go get that for me? Moms are special! Because we have to work twice as hard.
We really do! Dogs are not children, Lori! Look, sometimes I do have to take time off because braces need tightening or because my kid's head is a, quote, "lice carnival.
" But I always make it up, and it is just as valid as you leaving early for Shark Week.
All I'm saying is we're equal.
We all work hard.
No, I'll get it on my way out, 'cause I am leaving.
Penelope No.
Since I'm obviously not appreciated around here, I am going to cut my salary by 100%.
I think she's trying to say she's quitting.
Shut up, Scott! But, yes, I quit.
I'm sorry, Lori.
Your dogs are lovely.
Thanks for the azÃºcar.
My date's such a huge success, it's still happening.
Oh, I can't wait to meet her.
Eh, you probably won't.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh what happened to your face? Um, I took the makeup off after first period, because people were staring at me and all these boys were talking to me, which is the last thing I want.
I don't understand any words you are saying to me.
It was terrible.
Yes, you are, papito.
Elena, I thought you were finally listening to me.
I did listen to you, Abuelita.
And I listened to Mom, too.
I was very professional.
I smiled and nodded and was nice to everyone.
It looked really unnatural.
I mean, some people still called me Garbage Girl, but I just went When inside, I was thinking - So, thank you.
Oh, honey.
This morning I saw what you could be.
The granddaughter I have always wanted.
I wish you would've said that in Spanish, so I didn't understand it.
Oh, niÃ±a, no! No, I didn't mean it like that.
No, no.
You know, you use makeup like armor because it makes you comfortable.
Well, this is how I feel comfortable.
It's okay, I have a shovel.
Wait, what? Wait, what do you think I did? It doesn't matter, amor.
No one will ever know.
Mami I quit my job.
I don't understand.
The job ended? No, it didn't end.
- Did your boss die? - No.
Was there a fire? Scandal? Was he a sex offender and they closed down the business because of the shame? No! I have just said all the reasons! I quit my job because I found out that comemierda Scott makes more than I do, and he's only been there one month.
I did exactly what I told Elena not to do.
I yelled, I screamed, and it felt great.
But, now, we're all gonna have to live in the car.
It's open! Penelope? Oh, hello, Lydia.
You look lovely, as always.
I know.
I will let you two talk.
What's up? Penelope, please, come back to work.
You're just saying that to be nice.
No, I'm not! I need you.
Five bucks more an hour.
That guy.
Well, he's a good nurse but it wasn't right.
Wasn't right.
But in my defense he did ask for more than you did, and I have a lot of trouble saying no.
That's why Lori works with us.
I didn't even think about negotiating.
I was newly separated.
I really needed a job.
You said, "Do you want one?" I said, "Yes.
" And you see, he made me feel that somehow I was lucky to have him.
I even gave him my parking spot.
Oh, so the red Buick is yours? Good to know.
But I'm sorry, and it was nothing personal.
- Done.
Two dollars more an hour and Scott starts pulling his weight? - Done.
- Which he's never gonna do, so let's make it three dollars an hour.
- Done! Please? - Okay.
Okay.
That was fun.
And I have to admit, Scott is not a terrible nurse.
He's good with the patients, you know? He's got a charm that I do not understand.
You know, all the nicknames and the fist bumps I guess I got caught up in the bromance.
I get it.
No, I don't get it at all.
But I get it.
So, are we good? Yes.
- Boom? - Yeah, I don't do that.
I do this.
Are you asleep, mi amor? Abuelita, no.
I'm not here to make you up.
I'm here to do this.
This is me.
No armor.
I think you look beautiful.
Aw.
I hate it.
This is how you feel when you're wearing makeup? Yeah, it is.
And I'm okay with that.
You know, this is the only time anyone has ever seen me without makeup.
I'm honored.
Well, one time your abuelo came home early and saw me, but as soon as I realized, I went out the window.
I assume he thought I was an intruder.
We never spoke of it.
- Are you wearing a little mascara? - No!
 [alarm beeps] [Latin music playing over stereo] [music continues playing] - Good morning.
You're amazing.
I know.
Mami, we already have crosses everywhere.
Do we really need a pope on the fridge? Oh, yes, because he is so inspiring.
You walk in to get a yogurt, you see him Hola, Papa.
Puts a smile on your face.
Well, why don't you put the pope in your room and go smile in there? [laughs] I already have two popes in my room.
Gracias very much.
[theme song playing in Spanish] You can probably dump that whole thing on there.
[laughs] Next time.
- [chuckles] - [door slams] [all] Hi! Welcome home, Lupita.
We are almost done, but there is plenty left.
Aw.
Dinner with my entire family And Schneider.
Yes, I invited him again.
He's an orphan.
I ate alone in front of the TV.
Ay, pobrecito Schneider.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
It was a massive TV.
Sometimes my nanny would join me, but only if I agreed to watch telenovelas.
Ooh, those are so over the top.
Right? This one time, Rosa got jealous of the housekeeper 'cause she was makin' a move on her man, so she threatened to throw live scorpions on her while she slept.
Sounds good.
Ex-nanny.
Now, stepmother.
[sighs] I am so glad to be here.
I'm just glad to be home with everybody.
Who the hell are you? [scoffs] This is Carmen, my best friend.
I'm doing my history project with her.
These all sound like things I should know.
Hi, Carmen.
[grunts] I'm Penelope.
Kind of a big deal around here.
So, uh, what's this history project you're working on? And then maybe later you can show me how to turn into a bat.
Well, we just got done explaining the whole thing.
Oh, come on, mija, I missed it.
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
Alex, tell your mother that funny story that happened in chemistry class.
- Again? - I know, okay, I'll tell it.
Oh, that story never gets old.
- [laughs] - [Penelope] Oh, man.
I've been workin' so much, I'm missing all the scoops plus Latina Twilight over here.
Careful.
There's a lot of garlic in that chicken.
Your mom's kind of mean.
I'm obsessed with her.
Who would like a pastelito? Mmm! You know what? How about we go on a family hike this Saturday like we used to? Mom, uh, Carmen and I need all Saturday for our history thing.
It's educational.
Eh, I don't know.
Okay, Saturday's out.
How about we go on a hike Sunday morning before it gets hot? You seem to have forgot.
Sunday morning is for church.
So, we skip church.
You seem to have forgot.
We don't skip church.
Oh, really? My great uncle Luisito skipped church, and on the same day, he was crushed by a runaway tractor.
Why don't you just go to church and then go hikin' after? We're Latinos, church takes all day.
By the time you're done with mass and you've said hello to fulano y fulana, - it's five o'clock! - Oh, you exaggerate.
4:30.
[Penelope clicks tongue] I wanna see these guys this weekend.
Come on.
'Cause I like them.
[chuckles] - [Alex and Elena chuckle] - Oh, no, I have to put my foot down.
Well, I am putting both of my feet down.
We are going and that is the end of it.
Ya! That's not your decision to make.
It's startin' to feel kinda like home in here.
I'm with Mom.
We don't need to go to church.
After all, Abuelita, you don't even believe half that stuff.
- I believe everything.
Okay, so, if you believe that, then you're Protestant.
There is no need for name-calling.
All I know is that a good Catholic does not skip church.
Right, papito? I like church.
I see my friends.
I eat some donuts.
Now, this one gets it.
We're going.
Weekends are my only chance.
So, this Sunday, no church.
End of discussion.
[speaking Spanish] - Ooh.
- [Carmen] Ooh.
[in English] What? What'd she say? I am raising my voice, because I cannot believe we're having this discussion! I'm their mother! I don't need to ask permission! I decide.
And I am your mother, and I decide what you decide.
We are a family, damn it! Don't make me choose between you.
All right, everybody, go do your homework.
Schneider, go call one of your moms.
Fine.
Guess I'll just go eat this all alone in front of my massive TV.
- Thought that was at your dad's house - I have one, too! - Ay.
- [door closes] Okay, Mami I love you, but I'm their mother and you're making decisions that I should be making.
- Â¿Ah, sÃ­? - Yeah.
Like, I don't like the kids having dessert every night.
But we have to watch our sugar.
Dad had diabetes.
So, I killed your father? What? No! Mami, look around.
I told you, I don't want crosses and pope stuff everywhere.
My apartment looks like Jesus' Pinterest page.
This is my house, and I decide if I want obese kids or the pope staring at me while I pee.
Ah yo entiendo.
I cook, I clean, I teach the children manners But if I should have an opinion, you want me to keep my mouth shut.
No more! You don't like what I am doing, I won't do it.
- Mami, please.
- I'll be in my servant's quarters.
Slam! I have to say "slam" because you would not give me a door! [alarm beeps] [Latin music playing over stereo] What? Eso Yeah! Oh.
Where's Abuelita? - Pouting.
- Where's breakfast? Working on it.
Where's breakfast? I'm I'm working on it.
Where are my pants? You're kidding, right? How can you not know where your pants are at? Abuelita washed them.
She's probably under something.
[music stops playing] Kids I think your abuelita has run away from home.
[knocking on door] [clears throat] - Hello, Schneider.
Listen, have you - Wow! I always forget how huge your apartment is.
Nah, come on, it's not that big.
But let's talk in the parlor.
Schneider, have you seen my mom? Gosh, no.
[sniffs] Then why do I smell fried plantains and Cuban coffee? Fine! She spent the night.
- Where is she? - [Schneider] I don't know.
After last night's ugliness, she spent the night and left without saying goodbye, so she already knows the drill.
Unlike some people.
What was that? And why was she drinking my coffee? Well, when my family oasis blew up last night, I had to seek solace in the arms of I don't know her name.
Your mom called her the "Stick Girl" and made her eat plato de huevos.
Did Abuelita forget to give her her pants, too? Well, there's no reason to get lawyers involved.
My daughter.
Katie, if I raised my voice the other night, I'm sorry.
No, no, wait, wait, no.
Now I am not going to apologize for saying "unemployed," because that's what you are.
[laughs] You're so sensitive.
[imitates gunshot] And, sweetheart, I just want you to be honest with yourself and ask what happens if your self-published vampire erotica doesn't take off.
No, no, of course, I believe in you.
[stutters] It's And she's gone.
[sighs] Well, you know how kids are.
Thirty-seven is a rough age.
She just sighs really loudly.
[imitates Lydia] "Ay!" [normal] Anything to draw attention to the fact that she's wounded and nearby.
[stutters] My ex used to have a sigh, too.
It went like this [inhales deeply] "I hate you!" I still miss her.
I just I don't I don't have time for this drama, you know? I got work, I got bills, I got kids.
Well, doesn't she help out? Yeah, she gets the groceries, cooks, cleans, spends time with the kids, does the laundry Sounds like she does everything.
Well, it does when I say it out loud.
She's also turning my apartment into the Sistine Chapel.
- [cell phone rings] Wait, hold on.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Schneider, I am just about to leave.
What's up? I just came down to get my afternoon cafÃ© con leche and kiss on the cheek from your mom, - but she's still not here.
- What? But don't worry, though.
I got this.
All three kids are fine.
- Three? - Yeah.
She's the ghost who ate all my chicken.
Hi, Ms.
Alvarez.
[Schneider] Takin' you off speaker.
Great.
Now she's gonna send her flying monkeys after me.
- And now you're off speaker.
- Schneider! Oh, my God.
I had to get out of my apartment.
Stick Girl is still up there.
I called her an Uber this morning.
The guy never showed.
Maybe it's a sign.
Should I marry her? Schneider, I gotta go.
Okay, now I'm worried.
She's never not been home when the kids get there.
You know, the entire world is one giant, wet bathroom floor.
- [stutters] Any idea where she could be? - No, none.
Huh Where would a devout Catholic woman go after an argument with her daughter about religion? [scoffs] Thank you, Dr.
Berkowitz.
Thank you.
But we need to answer the question.
[sighs] Hi, Mami.
So, you just assumed I was here? Because I'm an ignorant, old woman married to prayer? But you are here.
- [chuckles] She is such a suck-up.
She thinks she's tan fancy because her four grandsons are altar boys.
Guataca.
[scoffs] Move over.
- Ah-ah! - Oh! [sighs] So have you been here all day? Getting decorating ideas? No I have been riding around this morning in something called el Uber.
Oh, wow.
That must've been expensive.
Schneider set it up.
Oh, her.
Mami I feel terrible about our argument, but we gotta talk about some things.
Okay.
But you must keep your voice down, because you-know-who just put in new batteries.
So I may have overreacted last night, but you have to understand, I'm not gonna be a mom for much longer.
Elena is having her quinces.
Alex is already using hair gel.
And, you know, soon they're gonna be out of the house.
- [crying] Don't put me in a home.
- What? What, Mami? No, no.
I wouldn't I'm not gonna do I would never do that.
I would never do that! - Ever.
- [mumbles] - Oh, no? - No! I would never put you in a home.
- Mami, where is this coming from? - [sighs] Your abuela [sniffles] Berto's mama, used to live with us And all day long, she would slice onions the most beautiful paper-thin onions.
I remember.
Nobody could slice an onion like Abuela.
But it made her feel useful.
Problem was, we hated onions.
So, one day we told her.
The next week, dead.
Oh that's terrible.
I know.
I still get teary when I [stutters] slice an onion.
[sobbing] Mami, you are the glue that holds our home together.
- No.
- [sniffles] I'm really not.
We need you.
So, Mami could you make me un cafecito in the morning for the rest of my life? [sighs] [sniffles] Claro.
[Birdie] Aw She is like a bat! Shall we? Yes.
And we'll be back Sunday, anyways.
Yeah, you know, we'll talk about that later.
We'll talk What's to talk about? Well [stutters and chuckles] I'm just not sure I wanna go to church [softly] Maybe ever again.
I will pray for your eternal soul And then call el Uber.
[all] Hi! Welcome home, Lupita! We already started, but I insisted nobody say anything interesting till you got here.
Aw, that's so sweet.
It's been weird.
Did you find Abuelita? Yeah, she's with Jesus now.
- [Elena and Alex] What? - [Penelope] No, no! Sorry.
She's at church.
Uh, poor choice of words.
Grab a cedar plank and dig in.
Big change from Abuelita's cooking, huh? You like it? I can't wait to have eaten it.
I didn't think I would like nettles.
And I was right.
Well, I'm competing with perfection here.
It's okay, Schneider.
We all thank you for this very Caucasian meal.
And good to see you again, Elena's best friend, Carmen, you beautiful weirdo.
Seems like us.
We have all kinds of arguments in my family.
I have two brothers.
One's a priest, one's a witch, so I am really glad I'm getting to know you better, Carmen.
[door opens] Hello! - [Elena] Oh! - [Schneider] Oh, thank God! I am so glad you're home.
I was wilting under the pressure to be you.
Oh, hello, babies.
I'm sure you did fine.
- Why? Oh, didn't she tell you? She's no longer going to church.
Ever.
We can do that? You can't.
We will all go together.
Us.
Your mother will go hiking with Satan.
Yeah, and then we'll go to Applebee's.
'Cause Satan loves the Fiesta Lime Chicken! So, I guess you want to take my grandchildren to hell with you.
Don't worry, papito, there is.
Okay! You you really wanna do this? All right, let's do this.
I am not even sure I even believe in God, okay? [all gasp] Hardcore.
Oye, you're so smart.
If God doesn't exist, who made all of this? Target.
Okay, can we agree that if there is a God, it's gender-neutral, not a he or a she? No! God is a man.
If he were a woman, there would be less problems.
Pobrecito God.
You like going to church.
It's habit.
You put on lipstick, you get dressed up, you see your friends, you gossip "Oye.
La nieta de Olguitita got new tetas.
" It's your little social club, Mami, and that's fine.
It is more than that.
I pray.
I seek forgiveness.
He kept you safe.
Every day that you were gone, he kept you safe.
My little girl says she wants to go in the Army, and then the Army sends her to Afghanistan where she is getting shot at and I don't even know what else Have you any idea how much I worried? When you were deployed, I went to church every day and I prayed that he would keep you safe.
[sniffles] And he did.
So don't you tell me about God.
I know that God exists.
And he is great.
[sobbing] Mami, I'm sorry.
- [sniffles] I had no idea.
You know, you went missing for one day and I was worried sick.
I can't imagine what it must feel like to worry all those years.
Ay, sÃ­.
All those years putting up with Birdie, with her terrible hairdos and her smelly bad breath.
[sobbing] - Look - [sniffles] I still wear the cross you gave me.
[gasps] So you do believe.
No, I don't wear it because it's a cross.
- Okay.
- [both sobbing] So, are we going to church or not? Yes.
Wait, no.
Wait Sometimes, okay? - Sometimes, okay? - Yeah.
Well, at least at least Christmas and Easter.
[sniffles] And one other time, so we are not those people.
And I'm not saying God doesn't exist.
In fact, I check in with him constantly, you know, like, "Please, God, don't let Elena come home with a face tattoo.
You know, once in Afghanistan I came out of 20 hours of surgery, and I was so tired.
I went into the break room and Serena Williams was on TV.
She was so focused.
She was making these impossible shots.
[stutters] And I just kept thinking about everything that she had to go through to get to where she is.
All the hours of sacrifice, all the practice.
And then I just felt like, "Okay if she can do that, then I can do this.
" That's how I feel when I watch John Cena.
[stuttering] Exactly.
Or Sonia Sotomayor or Death.
Everyone has something that inspires them.
Yo entiendo.
[clicks tongue] I also play Nintendo.
[alarm beeps] [Latin music playing over stereo] [mouthing] - Good morning.
- [both] Morning.
[music continues playing]
You better stop flirting with me, Jerry.
People don't hook up with their Uber driver, unless they want to be part of a very unfortunate story in the news.
But you're not gonna murder me and throw me in the trunk, right, Jer? Well, not now.
I needed that joke.
I'm a little hyped up, if you can't tell.
Take it easy.
It's just a first date.
Just have fun.
Wait, what? Hold on.
- DÃ­game.
Mami, the story of when you and Papi first met.
Cuba, 1958.
You might wanna circle the block, Jerry.
It was a hot, steamy night, and I had borrowed my sister Maruchi's red dress.
And I had snuck into the Havana Club.
And the passion fell like rain drops.
I am Berto.
I was Lydia.
Now I am yours.
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.
How could you know? You've never left Cuba.
And now I never will.
What is it like to be so loved? You tell me.
I don't speak Spanish, but I know your date's not gonna be that good.
Schneider's a wreck.
Tell it again.
Then my mom says, "NiÃ±a, your papi and I have a love that goes beyond death.
" You know, she still talks to him out loud.
He's dead, Jerry.
I'm kinda jealous of him.
Oh, Jerry, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm out.
-Thank you.
But I should give myself five stars for making it out of the house tonight.
I can't tell you what it took just to get to this moment.
But you're gonna, huh? Yesterday, I was in my office I'm a nurse.
I used to be in the Army, but I don't wanna get off track.
I'll tell you about that later.
Anyway, they start all this stuff about me being So, what's everybody got going on tonight? Any fun plans? I was thinking of walking the aisles at Target to see if I can make any new friends.
You wanna make new friends, you ought to come to the bowling alley, and watch me crush some pins.
Anyway, I'm just, you know, flying solo.
Penelope you are so brave.
What's happening? I mean, casting your man aside and striking out on your own.
At your age, I would literally kill myself.
Hmm I get why you'd wanna kill you.
It's not so bad out there for older singles like Penelope and me.
Ugh! I felt that one in the gut.
For starters, there are so many microwave meals now, and I dig 'em.
Dating apps.
Oh, they're great.
There's guys like me out there.
Oh, I didn't know there was an app called "Disappointment.
" You gotta start dating again, Penelope.
Right now, while there's still barely time.
-I'm 38.
-I know.
I was married to Victor for 17 years, and I'm loving not having a dude around.
Excuse me.
I guess there are some things I miss.
I have a package for Penelope Alvarez.
What? Why why is everybody laughing? That's me.
Sign here.
Okay.
-Penelope.
Thank you.
Oh, my God! You saw that? You saw that! I still got it! I still got it.
Yes! And there are hot men out there with big packages and you know whose name is on those big packages? Mine.
So, yeah, I still got it, Michelle, but for how long? Because let's face it, Lori's right, when it comes to dating, 38 is basically sixty in lady years.
I'm the Dr.
Berkowitz of women.
I don't know what that means, but it sounds sad.
Dr.
Let me explain what you're looking at.
I'm a snowman.
I don't wanna be racist, but does that mean coke dealer? Snowman means, right now, I look good, because it's still winter and everything is where it's supposed to be, but spring is a comin', girl.
And all of this is about to melt.
That's silly.
You look amazing! Right now, but not for long.
I mean, I have one slight advantage, 'cause I got the Latina patina.
Because there's something about our skin, you know.
I'm sorry, honey.
But this is why I have to force myself out there to meet Adam Bennett.
-Gimme your vibe.
-Oh, hello.
He's cute, right? Yeah, yeah.
Maybe he's too cute.
Maybe he won't think I'm cute.
Maybe I'm not even a snowman anymore.
-It's not for you.
I don't know why I'm so freaked out! I was fine yesterday.
How the hell do I do this? Do I like? Do I swipe? Do I put someone in my cart? It's like watching a baby bird learn to fly.
Everybody I know is either married or I'm too embarrassed to ask them.
So, you were my only option.
I hear ya.
And I'm honored.
- Help.
Go to a coffee shop, make eye contact with an appealing stranger, then, follow them home.
-Follow them home? -Yeah.
Or to their car.
You could try a bathroom stall, but that's a little sketch.
I mean, listen, you do you, but you're a mother now.
I'm not looking to have sex with someone.
Yeah, let's not put that in your profile.
I get it, you mean a real date.
I helped turn a couple of boys to men.
Okay.
Okay.
Ooh, ooh, use this picture for my profile.
I look cute there.
So do your kids.
No one wants to see your kids.
That's, like, a second date revealer.
This is good.
Do you have some paper so I could write this down? I'm just gonna do a little Photoshop, replace the kids with a bicycle, so he thinks you exercise.
And we're live.
Okay, what about this guy? He went to Brown.
Yeah, but he's posing with a tiger.
Yeah, but he's holding nunchucks, so he's awesome! But not for you.
Okay.
You might also want to avoid guys who post their abs, but not their face.
Okay, what about this guy? He's a cop.
Okay, a guy in uniform.
I'm not uninterested.
He has nice eyes.
"Adam Bennett.
" And you have a date tonight.
-No, wait, what? That was too fast.
-No, you're too slow.
Come on, Pen, you doing this or not? Okay, you know what? I realized I I didn't think this through at all.
I I mean, my mom still thinks I'm married, so, you know, she's gonna lose her mind and Elena might be okay, but Alex, he's still so young and this could definitely mess with him.
I don't think I should do it.
If my family finds out, it'll be a disaster.
Maybe just don't tell 'em? Genius! Let's do this thing! Set it up for tomorrow, 7:30.
Both kids are busy.
-And, Schneider? -Yeah? -Schneider.
Hey! -Yeah.
Okay? My mom, Elena, Alex Nobody can know.
Hey, don't worry, I'll be way too busy to tell them.
Just texted nunchucks guy and I think we're gonna hang.
So then I was like, "Let's do this thing!" I went to Sephora, and bought a tube of mascara, so I could get a free makeover.
Hey, did you know that mascara's, like, 14 bucks now? Mine was 36.
Shut your face, my new best friend, Abby! Hey, can I get that toilet paper I asked for five minutes ago? Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
Found a jumpsuit for 40 bucks that shows off the girls! Talking about my boobs, Abby! Anyway curled, sprayed, plucked.
Abby, I am hairless.
I even shaved my lady 'stache.
- Wait, you can do that? - Yes.
It doesn't grow back thicker.
That's a myth started by Big Wax.
Oh, look at me.
Uh when I met my ex, I was wearing sneaks, jeans, a tit tank and a flannel.
I know, it was a better time.
Wait, are you okay? I'm sorry, I thought my boyfriend, Benji, was going to propose to me tonight and he didn't.
We gotta hug this out.
Are you kidding me? What? Sweetheart, look at you! Don't take this the wrong way, but your problems are nothing.
Yeah, wow! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I just mean that Benji is just a bump in what is obviously going to be a very smooth and luxurious road.
Whoever you marry, he'll be rich.
And you'll probably end up being one of those Real Housewives ladies.
And anyway, this is like 20 years from now because you're a child.
A tall, hot child! Do you really think that I could be one of the Real Housewives? I know you can.
Thanks! Wait, I thought your family didn't know.
Oh, I didn't tell you what my mother said? Red lipstick is for putas.
What? I'm just saying you should wear red lipstick for your encounter tonight.
-Damn it, Schneider.
-No, Schneider didn't say anything.
I know because you obviously shaved your moustache.
Was it that bad? Ay, niÃ±a, I felt like braiding it.
Anyway.
What is the right word? Let me see Uh, sucia? Tramp? No.
Ah, of course, hoochie.
I am separated.
And I'm not having this conversation.
And keep your voice down because the kids can't know.
Hey, you shaved your 'stache! What's going on? Do you have a date? How is everybody figuring this out so fast? I didn't want you to worry, so I didn't wanna tell you.
It's just dinner.
Mom, I'm fine! I mean, I thought it was cool that you were blurring gender lines with your upper lip but this is great! Okay, mostly what I'm hearing is I have to up my grooming game.
- Ay, Elena.
Please.
You're too okay with it.
And don't tell Alex.
- I mean it.
- Please.
First of all, I'm not a gossip and if I were, it wouldn't be to my little brother about my mom's love life.
Am I in trouble? No.
Well, when you're done thinking, can I have $100? What? I don't know, I need money for tonight because me and my friends are going bowling.
Or miniature golfing.
Or to the arcade.
I don't know, just give me $100! Uh, okay.
First of all, you need a plan.
Second of all, I need to approve the plan, and third of all, 100 bucks? That was funny.
No Stupid Finn keeps changing his mind.
First he invites Joaquin.
I don't know any of these people! We need to talk more! Don't talk to him.
-He cannot know about this date.
-Whoa! Okay, okay! Dios mÃ­o.
So weird.
I was dying to tell him.
I'm, like, buzzing.
Is this what gossip is? Who am I? Abuelita is talking to ghost Abuelito again.
I'm not talking to you.
Also, you're sitting on him.
I'm doing this.
Come on, Mami, it would be nice to have your support.
I suppose there is nothing wrong with having dinner with a friend who is a man, so Thank you.
If you wanna have a second dinner, wear the red lipstick.
I actually don't own one.
You can borrow mine.
So, I finally forced myself out of the house and overcame an expected, yet still surprisingly strong anxiety attack.
Thanks, Kristen.
We didn't get a chance to talk much, but you seem cool.
Hi, I'm Tyler.
I'll be taking care of you tonight.
I know you're waiting for one more, but can I start you off with an appetizer? No, you can start me off with a drink.
Because, Tyler, I went through hell to get here tonight.
Every aspect of this date has been dissected by all the people in my life.
My mom, my daughter, my landlord, some giant, hot baby in the bathroom.
Okay.
So, uh, do you know what you want? Of course.
Why wouldn't you two be waiting for me? I thought you had a thing with Carmen.
I came home early so we could all dish.
CuÃ©ntanos de todo.
Did he have soulful eyes? Were his teeth white, but not too white? Now the teeth are too white.
What is that? He was very nice.
And I'm glad I did it.
See who? You didn't wanna give me the heads-up that he was here? Heads-up, Alex is here.
Wait, why are you wearing Abuelita's lipstick? -Ay.
-Why do you know that? It's Scarlet Sunrise.
Duh! And why are you all dressed up? All right, everybody, get out of here, so I can talk to Alex.
Sit down, papito.
-What happened to your face? -What happened to your face? I'm sorry.
I was hanging out with my friends.
It's hard to turn it off.
Anyway, I wanna be straight with you.
Tonight I had a date.
Wait, just listen.
So, do you know what you want? -Let me give you a second.
-Thank you.
You walked out? I don't want those gossiping hens to hear.
But yes No one has asked me what I wanted in a long time.
And I realized what I wanted wasn't a date.
The kind that I make you and Elena split.
Aw, man! Anyway, I sent the guy a text apologizing, but I want Abuelita to think that I went out with him, so that next time I don't get the third degree.
Next time? Yeah.
Because I'm pretty sure there's gonna be a next time at some point.
Are you okay with that? Yeah, I mean, I figured you would.
After all, women in their late 30s are in their sexual prime.
Oh, God! What? Stop talking to your sister.
Tell her to stop talking to me! Anyway, dating is super weird.
So, what happened tonight was Finn made a plan.
Then everybody bailed on purpose, so Anna and I could be alone.
Okay.
I mean, I like Anna, but I don't really want a girlfriend.
It was like everyone had something to say about it, but me.
That's exactly how I felt.
And you're right, dating is super weird, until it's not.
Something else you wanna talk to me about? Well, I kinda lied to you.
I tried to shave.
Really? Oh, my God.
It's all happening.
So you don't want a girlfriend, but you did wanna look nice.
I guess.
I used one of your razors and cut myself.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I think I know someone who can help you out.
Watch and learn.
You wanna go with the hair.
Uh-huh.
Now that I'm shaving, it's gonna grow back thick, right? No, that's a myth.
Aw, man! Hola, mi vida.
Berto, you look guapÃ­simo in that suit.
Which is why you buried me in it.
So, Lupe did not go on that date.
-Oh, she lied.
Mentirosa.
She said she went, but when she got home, she wasn't super happy, she wasn't super sad.
And I know our Lupe.
There was no date.
What are we going to do about our niÃ±a? Dichoso tÃº, you don't have to do anything.
Lo siento, mi amor.
Yeah, you don't look that sorry.
I'm not that nice.
That's why I married you.
Little aloe vera on your upper lip and you're good to go.
I can't wait until I have more hair than you.
Me neither! What's Abuelita doing? She's on a date.
Aw.
The day every mother dreams of, when her daughter grows a vampire head.
Hi, Ms.
Oh, 9:00 to 3:00 workday getting you down? Yeah.
I take power naps, too.
It's called blinking.
[snores and gasps] I'm so refreshed.
- Oh, can Carmen stay for dinner? - Of course.
Thanks, Ms.
Alvarez.
Carmen's staying for dinner.
See? We take in all strays.
Except for cats.
They steal your breath and turn you into a cucuy.
Let's be happy Elena finally has a real friend, you know, and not someone from the Internet who'd probably end up being a 35-year-old man.
Under all that makeup, who knows? Mami, I am serious, okay? Carmen gets straight A's.
All they do is study.
Pero still, that friendship is a little bit, eh, cÃ³mo se dice? Intense.
They're teenage girls.
[laughs] What? I don't even think you know what that word means.
Oh, I know.
You said the same thing about me and Kathy Trecker, because we started sharing clothes and we both wanted to marry Ricky Martin? See? Queer.
You know what? You got us.
Kathy, come out of the bedroom! [laughs sarcastically] - [chuckles] - Look at you.
In a good mood, huh? [chuckles] It's the drugs, isn't it? Definitely.
But also, Dr.
Berkowitz's birthday party.
Oh.
He went to pet a horse and got bit.
[both laughing] Pobrecito.
So I got Scott and Lori to get balloons and a cake.
So, I got everything covered.
Glad you're here.
It's baseball fundraiser time again.
Abuelita, these are for you to sell at church.
So let's really get after it, people.
Ooh, got a great idea.
Sell them yourself.
Go! Go out in the neighborhood.
Sell them out there.
Aren't you worried about predators? I'm very cute.
I'm not worried.
Your abuelita will be three feet behind you at all times.
It'll be so much more gratifying if you earn that PlayStation yourself.
[groans] This is the worst.
There's my little go-getter! Hey, Mom, can Carmen stay overnight? We're having so much fun.
Why doesn't she sleep out here on el sofÃ¡? It will be more comfortable than the floor.
Oh, she just sleeps in bed with me.
I'm not saying anything.
Good.
'Cause everyone should feel at home here.
Hey, let's push dinner a smidge, okay? Ooh, rice again? Can we not? I'm doin' a little Paleo thing right now.
Also, I borrowed your nail clippers.
See you in 20.
I think peoples feel at home.
[theme song playing in Spanish] [laughing] Hey.
Hey.
Where have you two been? Where's the cake? Where are the balloons? [both] Oh Sorry, I forgot to get the balloons last night.
So why didn't you get them on your way in? I didn't wanna be late.
Okay, this? This right here is why we have two stars on Yelp.
Are you guys getting any service? I haven't gotten a birthday call or e-mail or text.
- Well, the office is kind of a dead spot.
- I've got four bars! - My daughter did call.
- There you go.
She wanted my Netflix password.
My birthday didn't come up, and my password is my birthday! But at least you guys remembered.
Uh, I believe I said grocery store sheet cake? You guys forgot, too? No, we we didn't forget.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[stammers] I have, um [snaps fingers] You got me.
I was trying to keep it a surprise.
I am having you over for a birthday dinner.
- Tonight? - Tonight? - I'm free! - Great! Tonight! It's happening! So it's a party? I can invite all my friends? Uh, sure.
Great! Lori, Scott, want to come to my birthday party? No, no, not them.
I mean, I'm sure they're busy.
Nope.
So, it's gonna be this.
But in my home? Great! All right, I got the party box.
I got some, uh, birthday candles, party hats.
This cowboy stuff is no good to me.
Oh, look, look.
Decorative plates left over from Lisette's baby shower.
They say, "It's a boy," so, technically, it works.
Okay.
Got away from me a little bit, I'm not gonna lie.
Sounds like a train wreck.
Go get it.
Oh, no, no, Alex, you gotta put that away.
You said I have to sell them.
We're about to have a house full of customers.
Oh, you know what? They got money.
Clean 'em out, papito.
And I don't know how to French braid.
Don't worry.
It's going to be a very classy night.
Papito, crawl onto the fire escape and put this on the grill.
Oh, oh, and take this stick in case of the raccoon.
Oh, Carmen.
We're taking a little break from our immigration project.
We're really hitting a wall.
I'm throwing a sad man a stupid party.
[chuckles] It's gonna make him really happy, but I don't think Carmen needs to be around for it.
- What? - Hey! Elena, it's fine.
I'll go get my stuff.
No, no, no.
It's not fine.
She has to stay.
This isn't fair! She's been here most of the week.
This is not a big deal, so why are you making it one? And during the party, you can't just hide in your room.
- You have to participate.
- Why? Because I am raising a polite human person.
And if I don't get to hide in my room, no one does.
It's cool.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be any trouble.
No, honey, no.
You're not trouble.
[sighs] Text me later, okay? You know I will.
I feel like I'm watching the end of Titanic.
Queer.
Ugh.
That's the centerpiece? It's not his memorial service.
You only gave me five hours and no theme.
- [knock on door] - Oh, God damn it.
Okay.
Okay.
Now listen.
This is a very sweet and lonely guy.
I've seen him riding a tandem bicycle by himself.
Are we ready? Are we ready? EspÃ©rate, espÃ©rate.
Ay, ay! Dale.
[inhales sharply] Hey, welcome! - Hey! - How are you? I picked everybody up to make sure they'd come.
Great.
Happy birthday, Dr.
Berkowitz.
Oh, please, call me Leslie.
Why would I do that? That is a woman's name.
It is also my name.
Uh, that's too bad.
Brought you a bottle of wine somebody left at my house.
I don't do Zin.
Not yet, Willy Wonka.
Let them sit down.
And, uh, where is that delightful daughter of yours? Oh, yeah.
Elena! She is so excited about your party.
[all laughing] And then this one says, "Doc, that's not apple juice!" [all laughing] That is the last time I misplaced my glasses.
And just to be safe, I bought him a cup that says "not urine" on it.
- [all laughing] - Yeah, yeah.
So you don't drink el pee-pee.
- [laughing] Good thing you drove.
Unless somebody else wants to give me a ride? [laughs] Oh, I am flattered, married lady.
Always interesting to be the sober one at a dinner party.
Now if memory serves, next stage is dancing.
[gasps] That's a great idea! Whoo-hoo! We should probably put some music on to make this less weird.
No, let this ride a while.
[sighs] It makes me sad to see Americanos dance.
I've got the looks I've got the body, yeah Mom, I got this.
[chuckles] [whispers] We can share.
Oh, that's really sweet, but I'm kinda doing a little Paleo thing right now.
- Ooh.
It's working.
[chuckles] - Okay.
This is so much fun, Penelope.
Well, I'm glad you're having a good time.
But it's not over yet.
[singing] Happy birthday To ju Is she singing "to Jew"? Doesn't matter.
It works both ways.
Happy birthday, Leslie Berkowitz Happy birthday To ju I, uh, want to thank all of you, uh, especially Penelope, for this day.
And thank you for making me feel like I belong.
[chuckles] Ah, y? Are you going to blow out the candles? If I don't, maybe this moment will last forever.
Aw.
But it won't.
Blow them out.
We did a good thing here.
Have some cake.
Forget about Carmen for one second.
[Elena sighs] - Oh, Mami, you forgot the knife.
- Ah.
- [Lori gasps] - [Penelope] Where's that cake knife? Remember the fancy one we borrowed from Marie Callender's? There's a Walking Dead on your fire escape! Is this part of my birthday, like a singing Grim Reaper? You guys are the best! No, Dr.
Berkowitz, that's actually Elena's friend.
I don't get it.
Mami, cut the cake, please.
And, uh, you guys go ahead and eat.
- What are you two trying to pull? - Nothing.
[sighs] You don't understand.
Text her.
Make sure she gets home okay.
And after the party, we're gonna talk about you and Carmen.
Oh, now that I've bought all this candy, I'd love to come see some of your ballgames.
[Penelope chuckles] I'm sorry, everyone.
It's, uh, teenage girls, you know.
Everything is very dramatic.
It must be about a boy.
[sing-song] I don't think so.
No, I think they're both stressed about their big immigration project for school.
Immigration project? Why haven't they come to me? Why would they go to you? Oh, boy.
[sighs] Well, there's no stoppin' now.
[mocks gasping] Shocking! I know.
Oh, I thought you were all gonna do that.
So, you're an illegal alien? Well, we prefer "undocumented.
" But yeah, born in the 'Couve, overstayed my student visa, forced to live in the shadows of Pepperdine University.
Took me a while to get rid of the accent, but now I can say [in exaggerated American accent] I am sorry about that.
Wow.
You must have been very brave, Schneider, coming here with everything.
Knowing only the entire language and struggling to unlearn the metric system.
My lawyers made it all okay.
- Well, that's good.
- [Schneider] Yeah.
But if you wanna hear a real immigration story Havana, 1962.
I came here as a child, fleeing an oppressive regime, with only my natural charm and perfect legs.
Here she goes.
And you know, it was written that I was Cuba's greatest dancer.
Whoa.
Oh, completamente.
And then [sighs] Castro.
- Mmm.
- La RevoluciÃ³n.
The Catholic Church had a program called Pedro Pan that invited the Cuban children to come over.
And they gave us our papers.
And I RSVP'd "Yes.
" It's my little joke.
At least you did it the right way.
Oh, Scott.
[chuckles] Don't ruin the night by being you.
I'm just being honest.
There's a right way and a wrong way, and a lot of people are doing it the wrong way.
How come when people say, "I'm just being honest," something terrible always comes next? You know, it's never like, "Hey, I'm just being honest.
You look hot.
" I said that to you once.
Do you understand anything? - So I can say it now? - Technically, but don't.
Such stimulating dinner party repartee.
Anyway, what's so wrong about saying people should follow the rules? You wanna come to America, get in line.
Oh, the one that's ten years long, full of hard-working people that'll do jobs that some Americans won't do? Like picking fruit? Or remembering to buy balloons and a cake for a birthday party? [crying] I'm so sorry.
- Oh, yeah, we're at this stage now.
- [continues crying] The next stage can't happen! It's just the country's full up.
Like a bar.
It was free before 8:00 p.
Sorry, but we can't just take everybody.
- [scoffs] - El bobo is right.
- What? - Everyone should follow the rules.
I did, Schneider did.
I did not, actually.
Lot of lawyers, lot of fines.
Mami, seriously? What you went through was terrible.
But at least, you had a place to go, and you were welcomed with open arms.
So some of them break the law and they do what they have to do to fight for better lives for themselves and their families.
And you know what? I get it.
Mom? Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah.
Uh, excuse me, I'll be right back.
[Elena sighs] Carmen's in my room right now.
What? Elena! - She has nowhere else to go.
- What are you talking about? Where are her parents? Mexico.
They were deported.
[chuckles] We had a lot of fun, but it is a school night.
And it's way past the kids' bedtime.
Okay, okay.
There's nothing worse than a guest who overstays his welcome.
But I did notice a Monopoly board.
[chuckles] You know what? Let's just wrap this up.
We really should.
Okay, they're gone.
But he was south of the checkpoint.
Her parents got picked up coming back.
- [gasps] - Ay, niÃ±a.
[Lydia] Dios mÃ­o.
So, the immigration project? I am the immigration project.
I was too scared to tell you.
I I'm sorry I lied.
[clicks tongue] You gotta tell me stuff, even if it's not great.
That's what our family does, right? Right.
- When did this happen? - Two weeks ago.
Two weeks? So have you been staying here this whole time? Yeah.
Most nights after dinner, I leave and I sneak back up through the fire escape.
[Lydia] Oh.
Are you the raccoon? Yeah.
But I felt really bad that we didn't tell you guys.
So I've been trying to help out around here.
I love it.
That was very sweet of you, Carmen.
But I wish you would've come to me.
How long did you think you could keep this up? A year.
What? [scoffs] We're gonna need more rice.
She wants to graduate with her class.
And she was born here.
She's never even been to Mexico, not even Cabo.
I'm on scholarship at St.
B's, and I get good grades.
We're a normal American family.
We had tickets to see Frozen on Ice.
You like Frozen? Sometimes the skaters fall.
[chuckles] Have you been able to speak to your parents? Yeah.
[sniffles] What do they say you should do? They said I'm supposed to go to my brother's in Texas.
Well, then I think that's what you need to do, Carmen.
You can stay with us until we figure out how to get you to Austin, okay? But you need to be with your family.
[sniffles] I can't believe they sent your parents back home.
They didn't send them home.
They sent them away.
[both crying] Okay, guys.
I think it's time to leave.
Carmen.
This is my favorite duffel.
The ones I shined last week? Shut your face hole! Yeah.
And, um, it's not much, but it'll buy you a cauldron and a wand.
I'm gonna miss this.
I'm gonna miss this, too.
Mmm.
But know that you'll always have a place to park your broom.
- You know - [sniffling and crying] This is like when I had to say goodbye to my friends in Cuba.
And my papi said, "Keep it together for your mami, or she will be so upset.
SÃ© fuerte.
[knock on door] - Hey, Schneider.
- Hi.
Thanks for taking me to the airport and for buying the ticket.
God bless white guilt.
Or is it Canadian goodness? [in heavy Canadian accent] Well, a little of both, eh? [in American accent] Damn it! Here you go.
On me.
Well, on the weird blonde lady who forgot to take them home.
I'll text you from the airport.
Text me from Schneider's car.
You know I will.
[both crying] [sniffles] I thought you said I was supposed to keep it together! [both crying] Well, that's you.
[crying] We can do whatever we want.
Mom, I'm gonna miss the first pitch.
Go faster! Alex, you know Mrs.
Resnick doesn't go faster.
Just try.
Mom, I smell gas.
All right.
Now, you smell Hawaii.
Maybe the car's bad 'cause papi stuck it with the name Mrs.
Resnick.
You know your papi named her after a hot teacher he had a crush on.
Yeah, but by now I bet Mr.
It's not funny.
Society treats middle-aged women shamefully.
I read a study online Okay, who wants to hear some tunes? No! Don't leave me in all this pain Don't leave me out in the rain Aw, right before the good part.
There is no good part.
That CD's been stuck in this car my whole life.
Uh, excuse me? It's a cassingle.
Why are we slowing down? Who turned on the AC? You know Mrs.
Resnick can't handle that! I'm sorry, but it's 90 degrees and you won't let us roll the windows down.
I looked it up! Great.
Okay, guys.
You know the drill.
Por favor, Santa Francisca de Roma, ayÃºdanos.
Uno, dos y tres.
See? Mrs.
Resnick's still got it.
Ugh.
break my heart Say you'll love me again Everybody! Undo this hurt you caused Oh, hello.
What are you doing, Mami? This is supposed to make your skin glow.
It's called a sheet mask.
Mami, sheet.
It's called a sheet mask.
That's what I said, sheet.
So, would you say you are sheet-faced right now? Ah! Stop or the sheet will hit the fan.
You are back so late, I decided to have a little me time.
Where you guys been? Mrs.
Resnick broke down again and had to be towed to the mechanic.
Hector's looking at it now.
Oh, how is Hector? I feel like I haven't seen him for days.
Did he ask about me? Oh, papito.
What happened to your pants? I ripped them getting out of the trunk.
You keep him in the trunk now? No, the doors got stuck again so we all had to climb out through the back.
It was terrible.
Oh.
Oh, guys.
This is Hector.
Hector Hector! Hello, give me some good news.
What? No! Okay, well, what exactly needs replacing? Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, what about Oh, huh.
Um, thank you.
Thank you.
Guys, Mrs.
Resnick is Muerta.
I can't believe it.
You know, your papi picked me up for our first date in that car.
It was brand new.
Only 60,000 miles on it.
He even wrote our initials in a little heart on the bill.
I still have it somewhere.
Aw, you never take us to Malibu.
That's what you got from that story? Yeah, but the good news is you're getting a new car, right? Oh, sure, I'll just have the butler pick it up.
Oh, butlers work at the estate.
Chauffeurs pick up cars.
Lupe, if you need money for a car, I am here to help.
I will teach dance again! It is a gift that I have withheld from the world far too long.
I do it for the joy.
You owe me $30.
Okay, well, why don't we take public transportation and reduce our carbon footprint? It's the best way to save money, and besides, I don't want you to have to go into my college fund.
College fund? You see that dish of change by the door? That's your college fund.
Well, not the quarters, 'cause I need that for laundry.
Elena, mi niÃ±a, a family needs a car.
In Cuba, my best memories are the long rides with my papi in a Chevy the size of this apartment.
It was glorious.
No, no, no, no, we didn't have seat belts then.
We would just roll out quick.
Well, I'm going to start taking public transportation, you know, to help atone for the environmental devastation that my ancestors and their gas-guzzlers so cruelly left to this earth.
Why does everything have to be a crusade that is also annoying? Abuelita's right.
We need a car, but we can't afford a car.
Unless we get a crazy good deal, which means we're screwed, because car salesmen are scary.
But not to you.
You were in the Army! Yeah, you're always saying you're a "badass.
And then they're gonna say something about floor mats, and then, "blah, blah, blah," I wake up in an ice tub, because someone took my kidneys.
I am a total stereotype.
A woman that doesn't know anything about cars.
It would be so much easier if Victor were here.
I hate to say this, but this is husband work.
Okay, Mom, this is not just a car anymore.
It is the symbol of the oppression that the bonds of marriage have placed upon you as a woman.
You can do this.
- Yeah, I can do this.
Yes.
Yes.
- Yes! 'Course you can, you just need to do a little research.
In the meantime, I'll take Alex to baseball.
Gives me a reason to break out the athleisure wear.
What the hell is that? It's workout clothes you cannot sweat in.
My car broke down yesterday and I have to buy a new one.
I went to buy my daughter an inexpensive car, and she drove off in a BMW! And then I had to buy it! Very hard to negotiate when the car's halfway to Vegas.
Well, I'm feeling pretty good, 'cause I spent all last night - learning about cars.
- Oh! Oh! Can you tell me what "anti-lock brakes" are? I mean, why should they ever lock? I believe you're talking about ABS.
Which is just a system that allows the wheels to maintain tractive control during sudden stops! What? What? Very impressive! Uh, do you know how to repo a BMW? No, but I am very proud of myself, because this is my first big purchase without Victor.
Yeah, girl! You don't need no man! Ooh! Actually, I do.
Apparently when a woman goes to a dealership without a man, they are quoted a higher price.
So I was thinking, maybe you can come with me and pretend to be my - Husband? - I was gonna say "dad," but sure I am in! Great! That's so great! We're gonna go tomorrow, okay? I am out! I I can't do tomorrow.
It has to be tomorrow.
It's going to be so good to see these people I've been paying.
You're home later than usual.
Saving the world takes time.
You know I used all public transportation today.
I went to school, I went to the library.
I came home.
Zero carbon footprint.
Zero interesting words.
Is that well ever gonna run dry? They took our well! Anyways, I explored the city today, too, when I was putting up my fliers, so I may teach the world to dance again.
There's a part of you that actually thinks the world stopped dancing when you quit teaching, isn't there? Yes.
- Mom, today was the best day.
- Ooh! Everyone saw me in Schneider's Range Rover and thought I was a total pimp! Mmm.
Don't say pimp or you'll get grounded! Seriously, Mom, his car is amazing.
The seats warm up.
You wouldn't think you want a warm butt but you totally do.
It's all the best parts of peeing your pants without any of the wetness.
Connie Merkelson told me she's never seen anybody slice apples with such grace.
Not gonna lie, she was throwing me some red hot heat.
Connie Merkelson is a gay lady.
But thank you for taking Alex.
And actually, I have another favor to ask.
Okay, but with Connie I think she might walk both sides of the street.
I'm gonna stay on the case.
Tomorrow I'm gonna buy a car, and so that I don't get screwed, I need a male presence to pretend to be my - Son? - Really? You're older than me.
Gross, but okay.
So I know you've been doing your research.
- What's our play? - You don't talk.
- Arm candy.
I hear ya.
- Yeah.
I'm just gonna walk up to that salesman, I'm gonna look him in the eye and I'm gonna say, "Here's what's up.
" You're gonna sell me a 2012 pre-owned Honda CR-V, low mileage, no upsell, for the bluebook price, "or I will burn this building down!" Save that fire for the bedroom, babe.
They gotta see that I ain't no punk.
Hey, they also gotta see that you didn't just get out of a women's prison.
Look, you know your stuff.
Just throw in a little charm.
For example, I have my own little secret weapon.
Whoopsies! What? Guess who just got a large latte for the price of a small? I'm trying to buy a car, not impress a white girl with dreadlocks who likes flat asses.
I'm just saying, I got tricks to get people on my side.
What are you bringing to the table? Playing the veteran card is genius.
Beautiful lady veteran, you're gonna own this guy.
Hey, folks.
I'm Jill.
Can I answer any questions for you? I got this! Whoopsie! Damn it, that's a Montblanc! Oh, yeah That's my husband.
I married him for his flat ass.
I see you served.
Yes, I was an army medic in Afghanistan.
Yeah Ai, sorry, sorry! I sustained a shoulder injury in the field.
- Thank you.
Sergeant Riley.
I was a driver and gunner in Baghdad.
Hooah! Hooah.
Pardon me a second.
Hey, Michaels, step away from the donuts.
The customers need them and you definitely don't.
Schneider, she is not gonna give me any sympathy.
Anyway, this Honda CR-V is an LX.
It's got low mileage.
Five-star safety rating, ABS Which is different than EX, because it has smaller wheels and no fog lights, 'cause I ain't no punk! Oh, I'm sorry.
Somebody's been doing their research.
Well, you know what, I am a straight shooter.
I tell it like it is.
Then why are you lyin' about that guy being your husband? What, what? Come on! You served in the Army! You've trained to rappel out of helicopters.
And you're gonna tell me that you're married to that haircut? Do you guys have one of those grabber claw thingies? We're not married, I'm sorry.
There's no reason you and I can't figure this out, just the two of us.
Oh, God.
Spider.
Spider! I'm glad we enlisted and not him.
So, mi niÃ±a how was the crusade today? Another great day on the bus.
Oh, which one did you take? Uh, the 60? That goes to Vernon? Oh, my favorite butcher is there.
I once saw a woman rip the weave off another woman over a leg of lamb.
It was me.
- Georgie, Miguel or Petros? - Petros.
Petros only works on weekends.
Sorry, it was Miguel.
There is no Miguel.
I made him up.
What are you doing? What are you doing? Okay! I hate the bus! Whoa, what? I'm a fraud! I've been lying these past two days.
It's okay, we know! Public transportation is hard.
The seats are small, it kind of smells One time, I fell asleep and somebody stole my socks.
Wait, so you used mass transit to shop for locally grown produce and then recycled? That's like triple fossil fuel savings.
Mmm.
Oh, my God! Abuelita's greener than you.
Well, abuelita, I guess you're my new hero.
Ah, Elena I've always been your hero.
Abuelita, what's this? That is the flier for my dance classes.
I've been hanging them all over the neighborhood.
"Experienced latina will make your body do things you didn't know it could"? What? It's true.
Oh, look, I got 58 new messages.
Wow! Oh, and I got a customer.
His name is Bobby and he wants I need to get a new phone number.
Congrats on the new car, Alvarez.
Oh, thank you, Riley.
I like this last name thing.
Brings me back to my old Army days.
You know, sometimes I'll get in early and hang out with the mechanics just 'cause I miss the swearin' so much.
But seriously, though, I feel like I got a really good deal.
Uh, you are a tough negotiator.
In all fairness, you got a pretty great trade-in, girl.
I can't believe I gave you 40 bucks for that thing.
Hey, it's got a full tank of gas.
The fuel gauge is broken, so you're gonna have to trust me on that.
Now, just clear out all your personal effects and we'll get you squared away.
Mrs.
Ah! Â¡Ay, carajo! Toni Everything all right? I can't get rid of this car.
I can see why.
Talk to me, Alvarez.
This was Victor's car.
My soon to be ex.
Oh.
Got a lot of memories in here.
We drove off on our honeymoon in this old lady.
He was an infantry man.
He was a good one, too.
In fact my husband was a really good man.
He was so charming.
And we were happy.
You know, like one of those couples that other couples hate being around, 'cause it shows them how not happy they are? We were that couple.
I hate that couple.
He got sent on some difficult deployments, he saw some really tough stuff.
He started sleeping late, then drinking He wouldn't get any help.
Then things got really bad.
And it wasn't safe in the house.
Until, finally, one night, I had to take those keys away from him 'cause he told me he was gonna wrap himself around a tree.
Mmm.
That's tough.
And I get it.
I went through some stuff, too, when I got back.
I'm in this women's veterans group.
Lot of swearin'.
You'll love it.
The hard truth is if your husband's not trying to change, there's nothing you can do.
Trust me on that.
Leaving was the right thing to do.
It's just hard to say goodbye.
I think it's time, Alvarez.
Oh, man! I haven't talked to another soldier in a long time.
- This was really nice.
- Yeah.
- You should come to the group.
- Maybe I will.
Yeah.
Wait, wait.
What's happening here? Are we becoming friends? It's happenin', Alvarez.
No, this is a real injury.
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's okay.
I'll tell you about it in the group.
It'd be nice to talk to a bunch of lady soldiers.
- It's hard to find women who get me.
- Oh, me, too.
What is wrong with civilian women? I know, right? It's like "Let's get mani-pedis.
I could use a fill-in like nobody's business.
Is this great or is this great? Look at us all together as a family.
It's just like growing up in Cuba.
Â¡Salud! I haven't even shown you guys the best part.
Play my jam.
- No! - What? Un-break my heart Say you'll love me again Undo this hurt that you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life Come on! - Un-cry these tears - Baby, baby, baby I cried so many nights Un-break my heart
 [theme song playing] [hold music playing over phone] Oh! Oh.
Abuelita, give me back my yearbook! Your quinces is around the corner, and we need to pick a boy to be your escort.
You don't understand social media.
Abuelita No, no, no.
Of course I do.
All you have to do is find a boy and twat at him.
[coughs softly] I hope you mean "tweet"? "Twat," "tweet.
" Same thing.
Not the same thing, Mami.
Can you guys go fight somewhere else? I'm on hold with the VA.
QuÃ© funny! We still have to pick the other 14 members of the court.
We have to choreograph the dances.
We have to pick the weakest dancers and put them in the back and put a curtain in front of them.
Elena, pick by the end of the day, or your escort will be Cousin Orencio.
Cousin Orencio smells like a Dorito that died in a pool of Axe body spray.
[mutters] [scoffs] Good luck getting him out of TÃ­a Mimi's basement.
I'll get him out of TÃ­a Mimi's basement.
Hey, no, don't touch that phone! Â¡Ay! [inhales sharply] Ay, ay, Elena.
As long as he is a dancer, and he is Cuban, and he is handsome, and I'm coming in.
[sighs] - [music stops] - Hello? [music resumes] Ah! That's cold, VA.
Ice cold.
[knocking at door] Alvarez, let's go! There's a street fair downstairs.
Beer, food this! [electronic sword clanking] Did you buy that? I won it after spending 40 bucks at the ring toss.
Wait, are you still on hold with the VA? No! I got right through.
[both laughing] Wait, can I leave this up here for safekeeping? - Who's gonna steal that? - Schneider.
Hide it in my mom's room.
[sighs deeply] She's my white whale.
My Bigfoot.
My meal cooked by my mother using no pork products of any kind.
[laughs] Hey, I served.
I get it.
But I try to never deal with the VA.
I stopped calling them about my punctured eardrum.
That seems like a bad plan.
[Penelope shouts] I'll see you down Yeah, she can't hear me.
[woman on telephone] Pain Management Department.
Last name and last four digits of your social Alvarez, 2294 [groans] Are you are you Are you are you there? Say something.
- Please hold.
- Not that! - Hi.
- Hey, Ms.
Alvarez.
Hey, guys.
Thanks for helping out, but maybe next time pick a food a kid would wanna eat or has heard of.
Yeah, and maybe next time, don't hand out masks with my face on them.
Handsome, but creepy.
[groans] [exaggerated whimpering] - Ah - What, Mami? Your daughter is so dramatic.
No puedo mÃ¡s.
Mami, don't worry, she will pick someone.
- [inhales sharply] Â¡Ay! - You okay, Mom? Yeah.
I just need to talk to Jolene and get my shoulder squared away.
The pain in your mind is in your head.
[sighs] - What happened, Ms.
Alvarez? - It's nothing, Finn.
Hey, don't be so modest.
She jacked her shoulder up in Afghanistan, being a hero.
[scoffs] "Hero.
" Kabul, 2004.
I was assisting in surgery when a mortar hit close to the OR.
But still, it is a war wound.
Well I thank you for your service, Ms.
Alvarez.
Yeah, don't do that.
So can we have some money for the fair? Sure.
Grab ten bucks from my purse.
[Alex clicks tongue] [groans] [groans loudly] - [sighs] - What, papito? Well, it's just we need at least 20 to do anything fun.
But it's okay.
You don't even need the ten dollars.
Okay, I get it.
I'll take the ten.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Guys, don't go anywhere.
I have kind of an exciting announcement.
Something went terribly wrong in your adult diaper? It's athleisure wear.
But the good news is, after months of planning, the members of my college band have finally put aside our differences and we're reuniting to play at the fair this afternoon.
Nope.
Well, it should, because my band, Full Sail, plays yacht rock.
Â¿QuÃ© es el yacht rock? - Mami, don't ask - Yacht rock is like easy listening music, but even easier to listen to.
It's cool, but not too cool.
Soulful, but not too soulful.
I'm excited, but not too excited.
And they paid you for this? Oh, no, I had to grease a few palms to make it happen.
So you're paying them? I don't want to get into the economics of it.
I used to show up at their dorm rooms unannounced and just hang out for hours and hours and hours.
I can't imagine what that would feel like.
- [woman on telephone] Hello? - [stammers] Guys Yeah, I'm here.
Did you find Jolene? - Just one more question, ma'am.
- Sure.
Anything.
Was that "Phillips" with a "P," or "Fillips" with an "F"? [softly] What? Alvarez! With an "A"! Hold, please.
[dial tone humming] Wait, wait.
- [Schneider groans] - What happened? It was a totally preventable accident! [groans] We were setting up for the show and our keytarist threw a decorative anchor at me.
Okay, I'm sorry you're hurt, but it sounds like I just missed the best part of your show.
This is why Full Sail broke up in the first place.
Too many passionate personalities.
I wanted to open with Toto.
Skip wanted to open with Steely Dan.
Oh, you can't open with the Dan.
They're dangerously smooth.
YOLO! It stands for, "You Only Live Once.
" But why didn't you tell me you were gonna be here when I saw you earlier? What's with all the questions? Is this Castro's Cuba or America? You you know I could take a look at that eye for you myself, but there was a lot of second-hand doobie smoke at that fair and, uh I worry that I may have a bit of a contact high.
Here.
Let me see.
Is that glitter? It's called stage sparkle.
Can you please just get it out? If I had a magnifying glass, I could probably get it out.
Oh, I have one in my costume trunk.
Halloween box.
Okay, whatever.
Come on, let's just go.
Quick.
Come on.
Mami, I'm still on hold, so if they pick up, remember Alvarez, 2294.
[hold music playing] [music stops] [woman on recording] Remember to self-screen for testicular cancer.
Good advice.
My husband always asked me to check for him.
You don't think Penelope suspects that we went together? Or am I just paranoid from all that grass? I don't want her to think that we were on a date or something.
[laughs] No, she wouldn't think that.
[chuckles] It'd be ridiculous.
Well, ridiculous is a little strong, but Lydia you were so wonderful to me at my birthday party.
And I would just be very happy if we could continue whatever this is.
[chuckles] [romantic music playing over phone] Can I make you a cafÃ© cubano? SÃ­, por favor.
Rosetta Stone.
- [device beeping] - Oh, espere.
So here is to Vitamin D.
- Vitamin D.
- [laughs] And, uh, estrogen replacement to keep me young.
For my cholesterol so I don't die.
What's going on here? Nothing! We're just taking drugs.
So, uh, how is Schneider doing? Hey, guys, I'm heading down.
This yacht rock band is about to be boarded by a pirate.
The sexy kind.
Just look for the big crowd.
That's the kebab truck.
We're next to that.
We're going too.
Elena? When I get back, I'm going to call Cousin Orencio.
[Elena screams] Sometimes you have to poke the bear.
[woman] Pain Management Department.
Can I help you? - Alvarez, 2294.
- Transferring you now.
- [gasps] - [line ringing] Oh, my God.
It's finally happening.
- Okay.
- [line continues ringing] Come on.
Pick up, Jolene.
Pick up.
Maybe you're peeing.
Maybe you're grabbing your four o'clock snack away from your desk.
I'm not here to judge.
You do you at the vending machine, boo-boo.
Answer the damn phone, Jolene! [man] Hello? Wait.
Who is this? Please be a man named Jolene.
No, this is Tad.
But this is Jolene's extension, right? No, I think they accidentally transferred you to an empty office.
[scoffing] Well, it's not empty now, 'cause I'm standing here talking to you.
I'm Alvarez, 2294.
Can you help me, Tad? Slow down.
Let me see what we have here.
[mutters] Alvarez, 2294.
- Oh.
- Oh? What's "oh"? Don't "oh" me, Tad.
Sorry, but you need a referral from your primary care physician.
[stammers] I have one.
What? I know, Tad! So, now what? Sorry.
Can you fax a new one over? Fax it? You mean, e-mail it? [Tad laughing] Okay So you want me to get in a time machine and go back to when they used fax machines to send you something that I know for a fact you already have? Well, if I had a time machine, I don't think I'd go back in time - and fax things.
- Oh, my God.
I'd buy a lotto ticket.
Okay, you know what? Focus, Tad! Okay.
I think the market down the street has a fax machine next to the off-brand candy bars.
After the day I've had, I deserve a Slickers.
Â¡Elena, ven acÃ¡! - Tad, give me five minutes.
Remember Alvarez, 2294.
I know.
If Tad picks up, keep him on the line.
Did you take down a bag and a half of Cheetos? Step off, girl.
Hello? Abuelita? Elena? Alex, no one's home.
Your mom just left.
Just grab some pills and let's get out of here.
Yeah, I don't know.
Or I could just take you off the group chat with all of our friends.
The only thing worse than being in a group chat is not being in a group chat.
[sighs] Fine, I'll do it.
Great.
I'll stand guard and if I see somebody coming, I'll yell "Tumbleweed.
" That's our code word.
Why is that the code word? I don't know.
Shut up.
Feeling like no one understands you? Yep.
Losing your appetite due to depression or anxiety? Obviously not.
[sighs] Do you have advice for feeling like the weirdo in your family? For explaining that you don't want to pick a boy to be the escort to your quinces, 'cause [scoffs] you don't even know if you like boys.
- Reach out and talk to someone.
- [Elena scoffs] Yeah.
That'll go great.
How do I even do that? "Hey, Mom, I think I might like girls.
" - [electronic sword clanking] - [Alex] Damn it! What are you doing here? Why are you spying on me? Tumbleweed.
- Mmm-hmm.
I was stealing them.
Mom is going to kill you.
I mean, quite literally, she is going to kill you.
Resuscitate you, kill you again, and then ground your lifeless body.
I didn't really want to.
It was Finn's idea.
Please don't tell Mom.
We were just going to sell pills to get some money.
Oh.
[sighs] [sighs] So did you hear what I was saying while you were back there? Nah, that curtain is pretty thick.
You can't say anything to anyone.
It's not that I'm embarrassed.
I'm just not sure.
I promise.
I won't say anything.
I mean, who cares, right? Good brother.
Now I really don't understand what's going on.
[woman on phone] Hello? [both shouting] Alvarez! 2294! Who are you holding for? I don't know, but please don't hang up! We gotta keep her talking.
- Is this Penelope Alvarez? - Yes! I'm Penelope.
I'm a badass, who served in Afghanistan doing army stuff! Hooah! And I'm her son, Alex.
I know my mom sounds young, but these days, babies having babies I'm back! Thank God.
I was running out of material.
What happened to you? I got roughed up pushing through the crowd on the way to the market.
Oh, Jolene! Oh, my God, Jolene.
Hey, let's go.
It's time for the smooth, summer sounds of Full Sail.
Schneider made me say that.
Wait! Let me warm up my voice before the show.
Boo Yep, I'm good.
What happened to Tad? Would you like me to transfer you to Tad? One moment.
No, no, no! No! I want you, Jolene.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to fangirl out, but you are Jolene.
Yes, I am.
Whoo! It has been a trip getting to you, mama.
Okay, so I just want to make an appointment with the chiropractor.
- So if you have anything for next week.
.
- I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to call back on Monday.
I I don't mean to be difficult.
Still a huge fan.
But isn't the VA open until 5:00? It is, but if I don't catch the 4:30 bus, I have to take the 4:45.
So I've been trying to get in contact with you for a month.
You can't take five minutes to help me out? Well, you don't understand.
I have to leave.
Well, then, walk me through it, Jolene.
Because I don't understand.
So I don't get why it's so hard to make a simple appointment.
And I'm one of the lucky ones.
My husband has bad knees, a bad back and traumatic brain injury.
He's not getting help.
Partly because he's a stubborn ass, but mostly because of this insane process.
And because he's not getting help, he almost did something stupid.
I lost someone in my unit because she did do something stupid.
So, please, enlighten me, Jolene, as to why helping soldiers is less important than you catching your goddamn bus.
m.
with Dr.
Pearl.
Will that work for you, ma'am? Yes, that would be great.
- Thank you so mu - [line disconnects] [laughs] Classic Jolene.
[sighs] Yeah! [gasps] Â¡Ay! Okay.
[whispers] That was a bit too much.
[sighs deeply] Ah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - [panting] - [band playing outside] Yeah.
Oh, someone looks nice.
Oh, gracias.
I learned to do the contouring on the YouTube.
Oh! She looks nice, too.
Interesting.
Very interesting.
Should I be interested? Because I'm not.
What are you guys talking about? Lupita, it is Friday at 7:00 p.
You have a date.
It's a date! What? Can't I just shower, put on lipstick and nice clothes just for myself? Yeah, I'm not even buying it.
Yes, why not be honest? Mira, for ejemplo, I am going to church tonight to feed the poor.
There, I said it.
Okay, fine.
It's a date.
Just a casual drink, not a big deal.
I met him through a friend.
Your date no longer interests me.
Anyway, I gotta go soon, but I forgot Abuelita and I are both doing something.
- Alex, what're you doing tonight? - Chilling at Finn's house.
Didn't you just say this morning that you had so much homework to do this weekend? Finn has this genius idea to fill up a shopping cart with candy and ask girls if they wanna hop in our sweet ride.
Okay, so you're gonna stay home.
And Elena will watch you.
Oh.
So you automatically assume I don't have any plans? - You have plans? - I could.
Abuelita, I already asked someone and I should know by the end of the day.
He's in my English class.
We're just friends.
And no, he's not Cuban.
Why do you two love to hurt me? - Anyway, have a good date, Mom.
- Bye.
And don't try to hide stuff from us.
What can I say? I'm a terrible liar.
I am so sorry I'm late, you guys.
I was at the movies.
Another remake.
Well, I mean, it was nothing like the original.
But I like 'em both.
Anyway, Lolly brought up a really great point last week.
There's a lot of anxiety and depression that we face as veterans that can lead to isolation, right? Because our civilian friends and family members, they can't relate.
Oh, for sure.
And there's definitely some combat stuff that's tough to shake.
In Iraq, if your Hummer gets stuck in traffic, it means you're a sitting duck.
In LA, it means you're in LA! But my brain doesn't know that, so I'm just constantly sweating in the car.
So, whatever.
On hot days, I just take my top off.
Which has caused some traffic jams 'cause you know.
Well, thank you for sharing, Ramona.
We hear you.
Oh.
Hey, hi.
Hi.
This kind of attention makes me sweat.
Like her in traffic.
So, it's like swoosh! Hello.
I'm sorry.
I'm fighting my nature on all of this.
In my family, the only therapist we're allowed to talk to is Jesus.
And he must be booked up because he has not returned my calls.
Oh, my This is why I couldn't tell my mom I was coming here.
She already hates that I'm on antidepressants.
You know, to her, therapy is for the locos.
Even my cousin Consuelo, who wears her underpants on the outside She doesn't do therapy.
No! No, no.
She's just "funny.
Okay, queridos, your abuelita is going to church! Vete con Dios, Abuelita.
Shh! I'm watching Buffy! I love you, papito.
Bye, Elena.
Hi! Leslie, I told you to text me when you were outside.
I did, but you didn't respond.
I don't know how to use those things.
I don't know how to use them either.
We have so much in common.
Agreed.
But why do we have to keep it a secret that we're going to the opera together? Because I don't want my family to think that something is going on.
They are so crazy.
They would probably think we're out on a date.
We we have different senses of humor.
Oh, mira, we're just two people on a lovely outing as companions.
A companions' outing.
How platonic.
But, Lydia, you look beautiful.
Uh, just careful with those shoes.
Oh, please.
I came out of the womb wearing stilettos.
Even my footie pajamas had kitten heels.
- Oh! - Oh! Lydia! Are you okay? Oh, my shoe My favorite shoe.
Taken in the prime of its life.
But how about your foot? I'm fine.
Whoa! Buffy's hot.
I know, right? - Oh, no.
- What? It's a text from the guy I asked to be my quinces escort.
He said yes.
This is a disaster! Yeah, for him.
No, for me.
My whole plan to get Abuelita off my back was to ask a popular guy who would never do it.
He rejects me, I full-on fake cry, Abuelita feels guilty, and boom I escape the patriarchal tradition of having to be escorted to my quinces, and instead grow out my unibrow and read a poem about Frida Kahlo.
He should be dating a hot girl who got held back a grade, not you.
Oh, and now he says I'm cute? What? So are you gonna tell Josh that you're not into boys? You know, that way.
Well, all I said is I might be into girls.
But I probably like boys, too.
I don't know.
Huh? It's like I've never tried broccoli.
So I can't say for sure that I don't like broccoli.
We had broccoli last night for dinner.
Oh, I see but it's not like you tried girls before either.
Sorry, I mean I guess, cauliflower? That's because cauliflower is a lot harder to find.
I mean, how many girls do you know that like cauliflower? None.
Although, Finn is pretty sure Denise Falto does because she didn't want his Skittles.
Skittles just means Skittles.
Well, let's just say I'm open to trying broccoli.
I mean, I'm not gonna go out and buy broccoli, but if broccoli falls on my plate Stop.
I don't wanna know what your plate is.
What to wear, what to wear Yup, you are not gonna be here.
You, sir, are going to Schneider's.
Ooh, you're gonna have a boy over here alone? Yeah, you know, maybe it'll be great, maybe it'll be terrible.
- But either way, you won't be here.
- Okay! But at least mention me to Josh.
Tell him I'm awesome.
No, no, too strong.
Tell him I'm rad.
Ramona, you're an amazing hype woman.
You're coming with me everywhere.
You do you, girl.
Seriously, I love that so much! Yeah! Anyway, there's too many choices, right? I mean, it used to be one uniform, which we all crushed, because we were in the best shape of our lives.
But then we get out, and it's like, why did we do all those side straddle hops when there's Spanx? Anyway, Pam, pick someone else.
I don't really feel like talking today.
Uh, our session ended 15 minutes ago.
Thank you all for coming.
You're just You're all so strong and you're so beautiful.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you, Penelope.
Release those tears, mama! Seriously, never stop.
Ay, Leslie, this is not necessary.
I fell.
I have a bruise that I will cure with the power of my mind.
In the car you told me you were dizzy.
You may proceed.
Great.
Let me just start with a few questions.
Uh, any allergies? Allergies are not a real thing.
All right.
Uh, any history of serious illness? Never.
But if ever I get one, my Cuban blood will eat it and absorb it into nothing.
There's not a checkbox for that.
Lydia, a stroke is not nothing.
I made a 100% recovery.
And I have full movement in both my arms.
I can mime in a box.
Can you? No, I can't.
Did you do anything different today than usual? What did you eat? Oh, I cooked a beautiful tortilla espaÃ±ola, and bistec empanizado and dinosaur nuggets.
Papito's comfort food.
And which of those did you eat? None.
Oh That's why you're dizzy.
Lydia, you need to eat.
You would make a good Cuban mother.
Please.
Cubans got nothing on the Jews when it comes to force-feeding their children! Now, Lydia, if you don't mind, I would like to take a look at that foot.
Oh, okay, but no hanky-panky.
My body belongs to God and my husband's ghost.
Lydia, this is a professional environment.
This is just some after-hours energy-saving thing.
See? All right Oh, no.
Well, this is a problem.
What? What is it? You have a hammertoe that has to be shaved down.
I do? What does it mean? Leslie, be honest.
Will I ever dance again? This is a simple out-patient procedure.
We'll have you back on your dancing feet in no time.
Oh, no, leave it.
So, things are going good on my date.
I think we're gonna grab a coffee.
Everything okay over there? Yeah, Alex is doing homework, and I'm just sitting here by myself, you know, watching Buffy.
Okay, bye, Mom.
So this isn't like some bad teen movie where the popular guy pranks the nerd girl, and you make me feel special and next thing I know, I'm covered in pig's blood? Uh no.
It's not a prank.
For real, Elena, I've had a crush on you all year.
All year? Really? I mean, there was a week when I was home sick and puking, but you were still in there.
Right? Mmm.
Where do you stand on season six? Dark Buffy.
I know, right? But I do feel like there were some solid stand-alones, like The musical.
You know you look not that bad.
I mean you got good lips.
You got nice eyes, blue.
Your smile is slightly uneven, but it's offset by a strong jaw.
I think you're super hot, too.
- I really like it.
That wasn't horrible.
That was not what I was hoping to hear, but I can do better.
Hey, Schneider, can I use your laptop? Yeah, sure thing, man.
What, do you need to research something? Maybe I can help.
I'm trying to get information on lesbians.
Oh, wow.
I just typed in L-E-S and it filled in "bians" and then a lot of other stuff.
I understand the curiosity, but I'm not sure you should be doing that.
I'm just trying to find out if they also like guys.
You have stumbled onto a real eternal question, buddy.
But probably not something I should talk to you about without your mom's permission.
And just thinking ahead, I don't think she's gonna give permission.
What, are you worried about something? I'm just confused because Elena said she might like this dude, Josh.
So? So nothing.
Wait a minute.
Whoa.
She just said she might like girls, but she might like boys, too.
Don't worry.
We already had the broccoli-cauliflower conversation.
That's smart.
But what did your mom say? She doesn't know.
Nobody knows.
You can't say anything.
I won't.
Even though I have so many questions, like When did she know? And what is the broccoli-cauliflower conversation? It's just all so confusing.
I mean, Josh is down there with her right now.
Wait a minute.
Elena's downstairs alone? With a boy? Not just any boy.
He's the super-cool captain of the baseball team.
Oh, that's even worse! He's probably rounding the bases as we speak.
Somebody should do something.
No, no, no, no.
No.
Um I like you, so I just don't want to mess this up.
Do you think we should talk more or something? - Um - No, I'm good.
You are so awesome.
Okay.
Hands off her! I am the go-to male authority figure here.
And I am shutting this unauthorized party down.
Sorry, sir.
You were right.
He is super cool.
Alex, you told Schneider? Oh, hey, Josh.
Alex Alvarez.
Sorry, I'm a mess.
I woke up with flat hair.
You know how it is.
I totally get it.
I'll go.
I'll text you later.
Right.
Alex, I can't believe you told on me! And I am certainly glad he did, young lady! That sounds scary.
I am nailing this! It just slipped out.
It's true, Elena.
Alex didn't mean to tell me.
- You told him everything? - Don't worry, Elena.
I'm not gonna say anything.
It's your business.
Yes, it is.
The only reason I'm here is because Alex said your mom wasn't home and there was a boy over here and I just There was a boy over here? Abuelita, what are you doing home so early? - And why are you limping? - Because she fell.
In church.
In church.
That's where we ran into each other.
I'll go grab you some juice.
Schneider tell me everything.
Of course.
This super-cool dude, Josh, was over while Alex was upstairs with me.
But not to worry, 'cause I came down to check and everything was fine.
The end.
I understand.
My granddaughter is a sex fiend.
She was here alone with a boy.
- What? - No.
Nothing bad happened, Abuelita.
- Mom - Okay, you're in big trouble, 'cause that means when I called you, you lied to Wait, Doc? What are you doing here? I came over to your house to bring your mom some juice.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Worth the trip.
Abuelita, I thought you ran into him at church.
You're both dressed up.
Wait.
Were you two on a date? It was a platonic companions' outing.
- What the hell does that mean? - I don't know! How dare you insinuate that I was lying to you! You were lying to me! A weird lie, but it's still a lie! How was your date, Mom? Hey, Alvarez, you left your phone in my car.
Whoa! This is your date? So much to process today.
So much.
Oh, honey, no, no, no.
Your mom and I weren't on a date.
Um Therapy's the name of a hot new club.
Fixed it.
Bye, girl.
You were in therapy? No, I was on a date with a woman.
Mentira! Therapy is for the locos.
I told you that you would lose your mind taking those antiperspirants.
And how dare you keep a secret from me? Lydia, take it easy.
You have a history of stroke.
You were pregnant with Elena.
I didn't want to bother you.
This was 15 years ago! I can't believe you! I have a hammertoe that needs to be shaved.
How dare you attack me when I'm about to go under the knife? This is obviously a very personal family matter.
Yeah, you should go.
Both of you.
What? I thought we were doing a thing Okay.
Elena I can't believe you lied.
I am the mom! I'm allowed to lie! And I am the mom's mom and I get to lie even more! No She is the one who is going boy crazy with this cabrÃ³n, Josh.
Josh agreed to be my quinces escort.
A wonderful boy.
He is.
I'm sorry I had him here when no one was home.
And I'm sorry I lied about it.
It was stupid.
Apology accepted, but you're still grounded.
And not by Dr.
Berkowitz 'cause now you've made that weird.
Okay, perdÃ³name for not telling you about the stroke.
And I'm sorry that I lied about therapy.
But I hope you can understand why.
Because it's shameful.
Not even your cousin Consuelo goes to therapy.
She fights the crazy like a strong woman should.
Oh, Mami, look It was it was really great.
It was a bunch of women that I related to sharing our feelings and our experiences.
And it made me really happy.
Ay, okay.
Relax.
Who said anything? Ay.
Okay.
So no more secrets.
Let me talk to her.
Alex, help Abuelita.
So Josh? What do you wanna know? Nothing happened? - Mom! - Come on.
I'm You've never shown an interest in a boy before.
And it's exciting.
It's terrifying.
But it's mostly exciting.
We kissed.
Okay? All right.
I get it.
My first kiss was weird, because I had braces.
And the guy said he could taste the plÃ¡tano stuck in my rubber bands.
But lucky for me, he was Cuban.
He didn't mind.
You should've married him! Oh, my God.
So Do you like Josh? Yeah.
Seriously, guys.
How good do I look in this?
[Lydia humming] Abuelita, how are you so happy in the morning? Oh, it's easy, Mamita.
Every night I dream of your abuelo, and we are playing dominoes and I win.
[chuckles] - Over and over and - Okay, I got it! [knocking on door] Hey, guys, you're in luck.
I finally found a vintage store that had a chair that matches your dining set.
Why do we need an extra chair? It's not really extra.
There's five of us.
But it's hardly the sorest thumb in the room.
Not the chair! What the hell are you wearing? Oh.
Che Guevara? Yeah.
Viva la revoluciÃ³n, am I right? You are wrong.
- Do you have any idea - I got this.
Do you have any idea Kids, relax.
[yells] Do you have any idea what this comemierda did? Grew an awesome beard and modeled for T-shirts? First of all, he wasn't even Cuban! He was Castro's right-hand man.
He burned books.
He was a mass murderer! But [sighs] He has a cool hat.
It's like if you walked into a Jewish home wearing a Hitler shirt.
Or into Taylor Swift's home wearing a Kanye shirt.
Oh, my God! You guys.
I am so sorry.
- I had no idea.
[pants] - Okay.
We forgive you, Schneider.
Okay, now I kind of miss the shirt.
[theme song playing in Spanish] Hey, everybody.
Oh, finally you're home.
I have great news.
That reminds me! Papito has great news! I do.
In school, we have our nation project and today we picked our countries.
We chose alphabetically by last name.
Finally, makes me proud to be an Alvarez.
You went for the easy A and picked America? No.
Stupid Travis Aarons got America.
I chose Cuba.
No, papito.
Cuba chose you.
It'll be nice for you to do some research on where we're from.
Yeah, I'm probably just going to film abuelita blabbing for a while.
You know her, "Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.
I won't even have to write a paper.
It's like no work.
[sighs] Be less excited about that part.
Put some effort in.
Hey, why are you so hard on him? [chuckles] Are you kidding me? What happened to, "An A is an A, but a B is an F, and a C stands for China, because that's where you're going to live now.
" Okay, that's true.
But papito has such a pretty face to fall back on.
Worst-case scenario, I'll just marry some rich lady.
Please tell us.
Sister Fidelis told me that I'm a finalist for the Voices of Tomorrow.
[Penelope and Lydia gasping] The singing show? [gasping] Nietecita, I could not be more proud.
It's a writing program.
Oh.
Kookie, that's great.
It's a really big deal.
Only 30 students get chosen out of the whole country.
Not that I buy into the aristocracy of the Ivy League, but it will be rewarding to turn Harvard down.
You get into Harvard, you're going.
Columbia even better, 'cause it will be easy for Abuelita to pronounce.
[mouthing] Columbia.
So, if they pick you what do we get to put in the Alvarez Museum? Come on! A trophy? A medal? A ribbon? And don't say the value of a job well done.
We need hardware! - I don't think I get anything.
- There's got to be something.
I need a visual record of how hard you guys are killing it.
- [shushing] We're going to have to make some space.
Can we take down the shadow box with our baby teeth in it? Why would we do that? Abuelita has a whole necklace planned.
Who would ever wear that necklace? Your bride, at your wedding.
[both gagging] I love that they think we're serious.
[both giggling] You're in a good mood.
- Is it because you - Stop! Think.
Is it appropriate? Never mind.
But I am in a good mood because Elena is up for a very competitive writing program.
- Like on E! News? - No, like someone who writes the news.
- So like Us Weekly.
At least you're reading.
But I'm proud of her.
She has a dream and she's making it happen.
I remember when I had dreams.
When I was her age, I wanted to be the next Allan Sherman! The famous song parodist? "Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh"? "Shticks and Stones"? And, instead of "Hava Nagila," "Harvey and Sheila.
" I used to dream of competing in the X Games.
A singer, a street luger and a person who could read.
What was your crazy, unrealistic dream, Penelope? I wanted to be a doctor.
Well, that's not a crazy dream.
It's just a regular, attainable dream that you didn't attain.
Oh.
[chuckles] No, it's fine.
Life went a different way.
Army, marriage, kids I guess 18-year-old me would be disappointed in my career, but she also wore brown eyeliner on her lips, so what'd that fool know? [laughing] So Yeah, I mean, I I've made sacrifices, but that just means Alex and Elena can have an even better life than I did.
So I had to flee Cuba and come here to America.
Your abuelo and I were separated for years before we found our way back into each other's arms.
[gasps] There was an earthquake the day we were reunited and I am convinced that the passion of our embrace moved the Earth.
[sighs] Not sure the science checks out, but who cares? That was beautiful.
[chuckles] Oh.
Gracias.
What are you doing? History is coming alive before your eyes! And that's too small a camera for too big a star! - What? - Keep talking.
You are so lucky she's here.
With the right production value, this might qualify for a Student Academy Award.
- [gasps] - Oh, yeah.
The Soscars? It's a thing.
I could win a trophy? Something for the Alvarez Museum besides my teeth? Don't forget your umbilical cord.
[chuckles] What the hell kind of museum is this? I'm gonna make a movie! I'll write a script, cast it, edit it Wait, am I making more work for myself? Am I excited about it? Is this what it's like to be Elena? I will start my beauty regime now.
I will be ready at dawn.
- Okay, but I have to go to school.
- Oh, good.
So we're doing this tomorrow afternoon? Ah, I was supposed to have jury duty, but you know what? I'm just gonna call my guy.
This is more important.
Oh, hey, Pen.
Do you have a 50-foot extension cord and some dry ice? You know what? I'll make a run to the depot.
There's this great one I like to hit in Pasadena.
- Do I wanna know? - Tomorrow, I'm filming the whole family for my Cuba project.
It's a lot of extra work, but I'm really excited.
What is happening to me? Elena, something came in the mail! - [shrieking] - Ow! [Penelope] Look, here! - Is it from the Voices of Tomorrow? - Yes, it is! Looks like someone's gonna be the next Danielle Steel! - [Lydia chuckles] - What? She's a writer.
We are pleased to inform you [both shrieking] "of your acceptance to the Voices of Tomorrow.
" I did it! Screw you, Harvard! No, no.
She didn't mean that, Harvard! "It is our pleasure to inform you that you are this year's diversity candidate.
" Diversity candidate? Diversity candidate! "Being a diverse person" That's not even grammatically correct.
"you have a unique perspective and we value your contribution to our conversation.
" - Ugh! - What? That all sounds great.
No, they're saying I only got in 'cause I'm Cuban.
An award for being Cuban? Finally! You should take opportunities when they come.
What happened to, "Diversity programs are part of our national responsibility", to level out a systemically uneven playing field"? - Well said.
- You said that when you were eight.
I'm sorry.
It just feels weird! It's, like, tainted.
I'll have to think about it.
Where's the letter? Penelope I need a consult, stat.
- What's that? - Lyrics.
I was so inspired by our conversation yesterday, I started writing parody songs.
[snapping fingers and tapping foot rhythmically] What a ham, what a ham, what a ham What a mighty honey glazed ham Or Exercising makes us strong Zumba, Zumba Wow, this It's just so hard to pick.
- I have others - No.
Okay, the ham.
I like the ham one.
Don't do the Zumba.
Please don't do that again.
I I am really enjoying myself, you know? It's never too late to do what you love.
Okay.
[stutters] Tell me, what do I do? First, you take the MCAT.
Then you take it again when you fail.
Most people do.
Me, three times.
[chuckles] And then, just four years of med school.
Okay.
Five years, that's not bad! Then three years of residency.
And you never know where they're gonna send you, or what adventure awaits you.
Why people say, "Holy Toledo," I'll never know.
Nothing holy about it.
It's hell.
[laughs] Okay.
[chuckles] Eight years.
Oh, and then your fellowship.
Three more years.
So, 11 years? Wow.
Especially when you don't see your family.
But, in the end it will all be worth it, because you will be a doctor.
And $200,000 in debt! [chuckles] - I still haven't paid mine off! - You haven't? Looks like the sweet release of death will come first.
I win! Isn't this better? A good camera, proper lighting, and a cast in wardrobe.
I look like a fruit salad.
I look like Cousin Consuelo.
Don't let the beard throw you.
It actually looks really natural.
I work every day from sunrise to sunset.
But I am happy with my simple life.
Cut! Can we do it again? It doesn't really seem like you're a farmer.
[in normal voice] 'Cause I'm not really a farmer.
It's not too late to recast.
You auditioned and didn't get the part.
Move on, man.
Okay, Elena, you're up.
Oh, here we go.
I hate it when the talent has thoughts.
What are you trying to say about Cubans? You're making us out to be total stereotypes.
We're not this different from everyone else.
[scoffs softly] Elena, get over the diversity thing.
A committee of people think you're a smart Latina, and they wanna help you achieve your dreams.
How is this not a good thing? Because I only got chosen to fulfill their race quota! They probably think I dress like this, and that I came over on a raft, rolling a cigar, and yelling, [imitating Tony Montana] "Say hello to my little friend.
" - Can we please finish shooting? - Yes.
I already e-mailed them and told them I'm not accepting it.
You did what? What [spits] You don't get it, kiddo.
You don't get it! This is a big deal.
And you don't have the luxury to be like, "Oh, it hurts my feelings.
" Come on! When I was 15, I would've jumped at this.
You have no idea what life is going to throw at you, and right now, you have the chance to pursue your dreams.
And not everybody gets to do that.
But it's my future! I wanna do it my way.
Let's get to the star.
Abuelita, you're up.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you there.
[chuckles] It is I, Lydia Riera, the most famous dancer in Cuba.
I can do flamenco, salsa, mambo, pachanga, and the Funky Chicken.
[playing castanets] [vocalizing] Okay, abuelita.
Time for your story.
Get me an A.
Well, when I was in Cuba the peoples would line up for blocks and blocks just to see me.
I was the iPhone of my time.
But then Castro took over.
My family was forced to flee.
And that's when I came to America.
Ooh! You know what would be good? Talk about being one of the Pedro Pan kids.
[gasps] Ah! Pedro Pan was a program that started during the revolution to fly children out of Cuba and give them safe haven in the United States until Castro left.
And you were Elena's age, which would have made TÃ­a Maruchi my age? And Mimi would've been really young.
Yes.
Wow, Abuelita.
I can't even imagine.
That must have been so hard, taking care of your sisters, since you were the oldest.
Mami Are you okay? Ah [voice breaking] You know, I am sorry.
I'm a little tired.
I'm sorry, papito.
Alex is fine.
He's a little confused.
Frankly, so am I.
[sighing] I know how much you like talking about all the good times in Cuba.
And I also know that there are certain things that are hard to talk about.
But I've never seen you react like that.
What's going on? It might be good for you to talk about it.
That's what I've been doing in therapy.
Someday, maybe you could talk to me about it.
I would love to hear your whole story.
I remember being at the airport.
We were only allowed one suitcase.
And my mami was so clever.
[sniffles] She sewed two dresses together, one inside the other so I could have more clothing.
Then it was time to say goodbye but I couldn't let go of Blanca.
Who's Blanca? [sighs] My sister.
She was my older sister.
Oh.
[sniffles] She couldn't come with us because she was 19.
Too old for Pedro Pan.
And she kept telling me "It's okay, we'll be seeing each other again in a few months.
" She said "Pucha, you have to go.
Walk through the pecera and don't look back.
"If you look back, you will never go forward.
I never looked back.
[softly] Oy, Mami [sniffles] [sobbing] [sniffles] She died when you were little.
They said that she died of the flu Pero quiÃ©n sabe.
[sniffles] Every day, I wish I hadn't listened to her.
Every day [sniffling and sobbing] I wish I had looked back.
Ay, Mami.
Mami, I'm so sorry.
[both sobbing] No, no.
Leaving was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
And I am happy that I did it.
Because look what I made.
[Elena sniffles] [chuckles] So, I guess you heard everything? It's just a curtain! Abuelita I had no idea what our family's gone through.
I'm gonna take that diversity spot.
[sighs] I'm sorry I was so stubborn.
It's okay.
Just get in there and outshine everyone and they won't even remember you're Cuban.
Pa'lante! Abuelita I'm sorry I made you upset.
Oh, no, no.
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.
I will tell it again.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Just let me reapply my makeup.
I didn't come all this way for you to get a B.
There are many rich stories from Cuba that must be told.
Oh, no.
The wind is picking up.
Un huracÃ¡n! [yelling] Un huracÃ¡n! - [Dr.
Berkowitz] Oh.
- [all applauding] Oh, Lydia, I'm so thrilled to be your date at the premiere of the greatest story ever filmed.
You exaggerate, Leslie.
[chuckles] Date.
And I finally have my contribution to the Alvarez Museum.
My script with an A-plus on the cover.
[exclaiming and applauding] And don't forget your signed headshot of the producer.
That's not going on my wall.
We'll see.
Uh but I may have something to add to the wall soon.
After giving it a lot of thought I have decided to go back to school to become No, no, no! Don't become a doctor! Please, I've been regretting it ever since we talked.
I'm so sorry I inspired you.
They did.
I'm not gonna be a doctor.
I'm gonna be a nurse practitioner.
It's all the things that excite me about being a doctor, but the training takes a fraction of the time, and it still comes with a pretty sweet salary bump.
- Wonderful.
That's - Thank you.
Hey, maybe we could both be nurse practitioners.
Nah, I couldn't.
Son of a bitch! Pobrecito Leslie.
Maybe this will cheer you up.
Leslie and Lydia Leslie and Lydia Leslie and Lydia We're just good friends [continues singing indistinctly] synced by susinz
- Hey, Pen, you busy? - Yes.
My mom is at the opera with Dr.
Berkowitz, both kids are out of the house and I am finally enjoying some time to myself.
Ooh, wine and coupons.
Been there.
I am unplugged.
Yeah.
No more Internet, no social media, not even a phone.
Anyway, I really need to use your computer.
That was quick.
- Why don't you use your own laptop? - I locked it in my safe.
So? Combination to my safe is on my laptop.
You didn't think to write it down We all wish we had the last five minutes of our life back, okay? I'm with you there! Anyway, I need to find a new place to get my eyebrows threaded.
No need to cover.
I'm just happy you weren't actually sittin' there clipping coupons.
And a threesome, eh? Get your freak on, boo! Shut up, that's not my porn.
- It's your computer.
- No, it's not my It's Alex's.
I'll just use the old eyebrow-threading place.
Oh.
My baby's watching porn.
Okay, fine.
It's aspirational.
- How do I talk to him about this? - Uh you don't.
I'm not looking forward to this, either.
But I have to because he's obviously curious.
And I don't want it to get stuck in his brain that this is what sex is.
Yeah.
He'd be in for a long series of disappointments.
Plus, you're traveling in the same direction, which fosters intimacy.
That's actually good advice.
I was expecting some unrelatable rich-guy story.
So we're in the Bentley with our chauffeur, Paco.
Father said it's time to have the talk.
We came to the next stoplight.
He hopped out, Paco told me everything.
I need a Paco.
Alex was supposed to be Victor's job.
- I did my part with Elena.
- How'd it go? Not great.
She asked me what a period was when she was seven.
I didn't get the period talk till I was 12.
Paco just called it "Shark Week.
" Well, they say you should answer every question honestly, so I did.
And I ended up going from periods into the whole sex talk.
It's not like I had a great role model.
My mom's sex talk was her handing me a white handkerchief and telling me it was my virginity.
"Lupita, nobody wants to marry a used handkerchief.
" "So, you must keep men from sneezing in it.
" Hello.
Here comes Professor Love now.
- So how was the opera? - Magnificent.
Oh, when Violetta died of consumption Hey, hey.
Aw! Here, you may have my handkerchief.
Thank you.
I feel dirty.
The singing was very good.
But the choreography could have used a little tweaking.
I gave my number to the usher.
I'm sure he'll be calling.
Uh, what was the name of that soprano? Oh, do you mind if I just look it up quickly? No! Oh, my stars.
That's what we've been talking about.
What? What about Alex? Mami, don't worry.
It's not really a big deal.
Alex was watching a racy movie.
Cars 2? More like Cars 3.
Okay, let's stop talking about this.
Yeah, whatever it was, don't worry.
You know, it's normal for a teenage boy and it's healthy to be curious.
Boy, the world has changed.
I Just think how difficult it was to see a naked woman in the Renaissance.
You had to pay someone a fortune to create a giant nude painting that you couldn't hide from your wife.
When I was a kid, there was an adult section in the back of the video store.
Behind the beads.
I'd always chicken out and just rent a Jane Fonda workout tape.
Still worked.
Still works.
Now there are no restrictions.
You can get a Renaissance painting right on your computer.
All of this is exactly why I need to talk to Alex.
You know, with the Internet, kids see too much too soon.
Then porn makes them grow up thinking that's what sex is supposed to be like.
How bad was this movie that papito was watching? - Awful.
- Pretty tame.
Okay.
Lydia, you asked me to turn away when you buckled your shoe.
This is not for you.
- Por favor.
- No, Mami.
Â¡Mira! I was married for over 40 years.
If anything, it is a shame that Berto and I went unrecorded.
- Â¡Dame esa cosa! - Ay.
Burn this.
Stand there, so I can always remember you this way.
Finn sent me a video to check out.
Have you seen my laptop? No! What's wrong? Does it have a virus? It is sick.
Yes.
Is anybody gonna tell me what's going on? - Yeah, I'm out.
- Yes, I should probably go, too.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
Okay, sit down.
Because this, like many things in life, can best be done only between two peoples.
- Seriously, what's going on? - Don't worry.
It's nothing bad.
- It's just about sex.
- Oh, God! Okay Great start.
Ay Look It's totally natural for you to be curious about sex.
If you ever have any questions, I want you to feel like you can come to me.
Do you have any questions? Yes.
But it's important to talk about this stuff.
Because I just I want you to understand that sex can be a really beautiful experience.
I know.
But look there's reality, then there's pornography.
Why are you doing this to me? For instance, two women with one man, - it's just - What? What are you talking about? You can do that? Alex, it's okay.
I know you were watching a video like that on the computer.
- What? No, I wasn't.
- Don't lie to me.
I know you put software into it that tells you everything I look at.
That's right, mister.
I did order that and installed that, and that's how I found out about this.
Mom, you gotta believe me.
I would never do that.
I spent my whole life trying to avoid this conversation.
Okay.
Well, then, if wasn't you, who was it? - Was it you? - No! It wasn't me.
Elena! Well, that is unexpected.
Did she admit to watching it? I didn't have the heart to ask her about it last night.
After introducing my 12-year-old son to threesomes, I figured that was enough great parenting for one day.
I don't even know what I'm gonna say to Elena.
I can't believe I have to have another porn conversation.
Oh, you guys are talking about porn without my sexpertise? Great, I was hoping to get another opinion on this.
Yes, let's catch you up.
We were just saying that with all the porn available now, it's a real problem.
Okay, so we heard from you.
Well, girls these days are exposed to so much more than my generation was.
Or your generation, Penelope.
- I mean, 15 is the new 25.
- Yes.
And I'm not naive.
But Elena's just not that advanced.
She's never even had a boyfriend.
I'm sure Josh is the one teenage boy that loves just kissing.
Maybe I should be worried about Josh.
Is he pressuring her? It is confusing for girls out there.
I'm glad I got married so young.
I was still a "virgin.
" - What do you mean? - You know, a "virgin.
" What's this? I was a good Catholic girl, so I wanted to save myself for marriage.
But there are other ways to do it that are creative but keep you pure.
I totally forgot about that Catholic-girl workaround.
No, I know a bunch of stupid girls who used No, that's not what I Ay, whatever.
You got snowed.
I need to talk to Elena.
- Do you want me to talk to Josh? - I don't even want you to talk to me.
- Big plans this weekend? - Don't look at me.
Where's Elena? I really need to talk to her.
You should.
Well, boys are supposed to want the sex.
Girls are supposed to pretend that they don't want the sex.
Read your Bible, for God's sake.
Watch the hair, Abuelita.
- Is Elena in her room? - No, she's at Josh's.
The family is having a movie night, remember? - That's tonight? - Yeah.
Jeez, she's been at Josh's, like, every day this week.
Great.
No, better yet, just come home right away.
No, scratch that.
Come home right away, but still call me so I know you're coming home.
This is your mother.
It's fine.
I shouldn't worry 'cause she's with his family, right? Yeah! What? What is it? Well, it's just that some kids at school said Josh is having a party because his parents are out of town.
No parents? That's terrible! I know! Who's gonna order the pizza? Who's gonna clean up the mess? Mami, parties are not good.
There's alcohol.
But not me, Mami, I never did that.
I'm happy to just leave.
Oye.
No seas ridÃ­cula.
Elena would never give away her purity at some party.
Ah, yes.
- Yes, you're right.
- Of course.
There's just three of them.
Three.
As you can see, ladies, I've got more than enough for the both of you.
Ooh, relax, I got it.
Elena! - Mom, what are you doing? - What are you doing? I'm watching a movie with Josh and his little sister! You scared me.
What's going on? Hey, Barb, Dave.
Ooh.
Love these hardwood floors.
Just hold still.
Oh.
It's good to see you two.
All here.
Not out of town.
- Why would we be out of town? - No reason.
Just 12-year-olds who don't know anything, they say a lot of stuff.
We must not have heard you knock.
No.
Thank you.
No, I just came by to bring Elena my jacket.
There you go.
Okay.
I'll just put it on over this jacket.
Okay.
I'm gonna go now.
But they left 50 bucks, so that seems fair, right? Guess what? Josh's parents? Home.
You got fed some bad intel.
You gotta up your gossip game, son.
Oh yeah.
It turns out it was Josh B's parents who were out of town, not Josh F's.
You didn't think to text me that? You know I always have my phone on me.
Unplug, Penelope.
Hey.
I left because I was embarrassed.
Everyone was talking about my mom, who ran over the mailbox to bring me a jacket.
Sounds like you got a pretty cool mom.
Look, I am sorry.
But we do need to talk.
Oh, about what? Here.
You're gonna want this.
Why does everybody think I'm cold? What is going on? Why are you acting like a freak? Okay, Elena, I'm just gonna say it.
I found it on your brother's computer.
Thanks for an unnecessary yet super-fun conversation with Alex, by the way.
Sorry.
I would've used my computer, but I didn't want it to get a virus.
Elena, that is pretty smart, actually.
But I still would've found out because I have that tracking software on all your computers.
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't! Okay.
It just makes me wonder if you're thinking about or possibly having, you know sex.
I don't want you to feel like it's wrong.
It's actually a really beautiful experience that you're too young to be having right now.
But if you are I want you to be safe I want you to be doing it for the right reasons, and not because you're feeling pressured.
And I I want you to come to me.
Because I didn't have that with your abuelita, and I want things to be different.
- Mom, I'm not having sex.
- Oh, thank God! You're way too young.
- Mom, stop talking! - Oh.
I'm gonna stop talking.
I'm gonna stop talking.
I felt like I was gonna black out there for a second.
Okay.
I just, like Oh, my Just everything is happening so fast.
You know, Josh is your first boyfriend.
I know, and I really like him, but I don't think I like him like that.
You know, you you got your whole life ahead of you.
There'll be plenty of other boys.
I don't think I'll ever fall in love with a boy.
Aw.
Yeah, I get it.
I've been there.
But I promise you, when you meet the right one, you'll know.
What if that's not what I want? Oh, I know.
I know.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about love.
And I'm so happy that we're talking like this.
Because you can tell me anything.
Okay.
Then what I'm trying to say is that when I think about love I see myself someday loving a woman.
Oh.
It was just, I realized that if I was going to be into a boy, it would be Josh.
I mean, he's cute, and he's sweet, and he's such a gentleman, but I feel more when I look at a picture of Kristen Stewart than I do when I kiss him.
No wonder you saw those Twilight movies so many times.
Definitely wasn't for the quality storytelling.
Guess this also explains the threesome movie.
- Can we not talk about that ever again? - Nothing would make me happier.
So Are you okay with this? Of course I am.
I love you.
Thank you.
I've been wanting to tell you for a really long time.
I'm glad you did.
Thank God.
It feels like this huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
Like the hardest part is over.
Hello, you two! Maybe not the hardest part.
[rapid knocking on door] - Who is it? - It's Penelope.
Either something happened in your apartment, or something's about to happen in mine.
Ugh! You'd be surprised how many of my hookups started with "Ugh!" [Penelope sighs] Elena just came out to me.
[sighs] Finally! That is a load off my mind.
- You knew? - Yeah.
It's been super tough keeping it from you.
That's why I've been hanging around so much less.
You've had dinner with us four times this week.
Crazy, right? I'm like a ghost.
- Wait, Alex knows, too? - Yeah.
But it hasn't affected him at all.
And I walked him through everything I know about lesbians.
Don't worry.
I barely know anything.
So, Alex is cool, Elena is cool.
Great.
Great, great, great.
[sighs] Can I admit something dark to you? When you eat sushi, you sometimes imagine the fish screaming? I feel really weird about all this Elena stuff.
Whoa.
Are you homophobic? No! I would never judge anyone based on their sexual orientation.
Some of my best friends are gay.
Yeah, that's actually not something I know you're not supposed to say that! It's just that now that it's my daughter, it's different.
I hate that I feel weird about it, but I do.
- Well, what does your mother think? - [chuckles nervously] When she finds out, you'll know, because she'll be on the roof with a Bat-Signal shaped like the pope's hat.
He does have a popemobile.
Focus, Schneider.
Okay, hey, sit down.
[sighs] My advice? If you're feeling weird hide it.
When I was 15, I told Father I wanted to be a professional tap dancer.
He laughed.
It was that lack of support that contributed to my drinking and drug problem.
Professional tap dancer? Oh, do you find that amusing? Because 15-year-old Schneider's drinking peach schnapps out of an unused tap shoe right now.
- [sighs] - Oh, God, you're right.
Schneider, you coming back to bed? Yeah, I do all right.
You have a girl over here and you were offering to have sex with me? Yes, Penelope.
That's the kind of friend I am.
[theme song playing] Hi, Mami.
She can't hear me.
There's my perfect daughter who I love so much, but won't call beautiful because she doesn't like it when people emphasize the importance of physical appearance.
Uh, good morning to you, too.
Hey, last night I did a little reading on Autostraddle, the lesbian lifestyle and pop-culture website? - Really? - Yeah! I learned a ton of interesting stuff.
- Lady Gaga? - Yeah.
Is she a gay icon, or just a publicity monger? I don't know, she's, like, a thousand years old.
So you're probably not interested in what I found out about Eleanor Roosevelt? Tons of monocles.
[chuckles] Mom, I get it.
You're aggressively okay with my sexuality.
Of course! Who wouldn't be? DJ Abuelita over there? [softly] Oh, all right.
I'm worried about coming out to her.
Oh, really? You're not ready to have her follow you in the streets, ringing the shame bell? I think I'm gonna wait until after my quinces.
Ay.
Poor Josh.
How's he gonna handle this? I bet he's gonna feel really weird about it.
But that's understandable, right? No, I already told him and he's totally cool.
I mean, he insisted on being my dance partner to show his support.
Awesome! I'm glad everyone is so cool and doesn't feel weird in any way at all.
[chuckles] You go, Josh! [chuckles] Ah! There are my beautiful niÃ±as.
Elena, I'm doing the final tweaks on the quinces choreography, so I really want you to concentrate on your posture.
Straighter.
Be as straight as you can be! Oh, my God, you guys.
I just got an e-mail from my baseball coach and I made the travel team! Him.
He made the travel team.
Oh! [chuckles] [Schneider] Oh, man.
All those practices I took you to finally paid off.
I did it! Him.
He did it.
Mom, when I get there, I'm buying you a house.
Aw.
So sweet, honey.
But it won't be near my mansion.
No one wants their mom around when they're dating models.
Just being real with you.
You still have Spider-Man sheets.
Just being real with you.
- What? - Why? Those games are so far away, you have to spend the night.
I can't miss that much work.
Well, I probably can.
Let me just check with my boss.
Schneider? You do you.
We're good.
So how about I take Alex to travel games? [both laughing] - What? - Just it's You don't get it.
It's not about you.
You want to take him on a trip overnight to a strange city? Jajaja.
QuÃ© funny.
Sorry, Schneider.
Look, I barely trust her with the kids.
And I'm offended, but I get it.
Come on.
I think you're being a little unfair.
I can take care of Alex as well as you can.
m.

- Blood type? - O positive.
Wrong.
Red.
He's allergic to tuna, and as for a turkey sandwich, he would quote, "Rather drink a cup of barf.
" Look, I can send constant updates, drop GPS pins of his location.
I know a guy at the pet store, we could chip him.
[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [in English] Okay, fine.
You can take him.
But if my son comes back with even a little scratch on his head I was in the army.
I don't know how to waterboard, 'cause they don't teach it [whispering] except they do.
- And one, two, three, four - [tapping rhythmically] five, six, seven, eight.
Arms up and pull her close.
[sing-song] Closer.
Closer.
Closer.
[sighs] Ay, quÃ© bien.
And this would be the moment when you would kiss, but you shouldn't.
Unless I look away right now.
Oh is that Andy Garcia? Oh, you are exchanging secret looks.
Josh, you will be the envy of every boy at the quinces.
And, Elena, all of the girls will wish it was them inside your dress.
[chuckles] Dare to dream.
[cell phone rings] Uh-oh Why are you calling, Schneider? Is Alex hurt? You might have a two-hour head start, but I will hunt you down.
Relax, everything is great.
I was calling to let you know we checked into the hotel twelve minutes ahead of schedule.
Hey, Ron.
Hey, Nikki.
- How's the hotel? - [clears throat] "His room is close to a fire escape and the nearest elevator was inspected on April 17th by an S.
Balaban.
" [clears throat] Ooh, I gotta run.
Walk carefully.
I mean, walk carefully.
No one's running.
[Lydia] Ay, mi niÃ±a preciosa.
[speaking Spanish] [in English] What's happening? - I just came out to Abuelita.
And I accept it immediately, no questions asked.
[chuckles] Well, that is great.
[chuckles] Ms.
Alvarez, you have the coolest family.
I'm gonna call my grandma.
Maybe she's finally ready to hear that I'm a vegan.
I'm gonna Skype Carmen and tell her the awesome news.
- [chuckles] - I love my family! We love you, too.
Oh, thank God.
I mean, thank God, Mami, that you're so honest with your feelings.
Yeah, I know you don't agree with them, because you are so liberal and I'm just a narrow-minded homofallopian.
- You mean you're homophobic? - Ha! There is the judgment.
Look I know you are cool with this, but you have to understand.
I am a religious woman.
[clicks tongue] I know, Mami.
And I'm sorry.
And God doesn't make mistakes.
Clearly.
And when it comes to the gays, the pope did say, "Who am I to judge?" And the pope represents God.
So what, am I going to go against the pope and God? Who the hell do I think I am? Okay.
Okay, I'm good.
[exhales heavily] What? You just worked that out in ten seconds? SÃ­.
Because she is my granddaughter and I love her no matter what.
Ya.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Okay, guys.
Guys, slow down.
- This room is awesome! - Ow! Okay.
- Dibs on this bed.
- No, this bed! - Guys.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, wait.
Maybe it's time for bed.
It's six o'clock.
Yeah, Mr.
Schneider, don't you wanna go hang out with the other parents? [scoffs] Finn, you little rascal that I don't trust.
- Who wants to play a game of I Spy? - This guy! When I was three.
Jajaja.
QuÃ© funny.
Okay, I'll start.
Is it Gordon? Yeah, he does not look well.
I'll be back in a jiff.
Everybody, stand under the sprinklers.
Ramona, thank you, thank you for meeting me! So great to see you.
So, uh, a gay bar, huh? Immersion therapy.
You gotta get used to being around gay people, now that I know you hate us.
[scoffs] I don't hate gay people! No, I don't.
You heard that "I don't" part, right? Ay, next round's on me.
[sighs] - Let's just call it guidance.
- Okay.
That's good.
That's what I need, already.
[chuckles] Okay? - [sighs] I'm feeling weird.
- [chuckling] [laughs] I am.
I'm feeling like if I knew more, I might feel better.
I don't know.
How will I know if a girl she brings home is a friend or more? Oh [whispers] You ask her.
Is she gonna tell me the truth? - Probably not.
- Ay, Ramona! Well, what are you asking me? How to spot a lesbian? I mean, do some of us have short hair? Sure.
Do we sometimes prefer practical, gender-neutral clothing? I guess.
Does a perfect day involve going to candle-making class in our Subaru with a roof rack full of antiques? That's just solid American fun.
[chuckles] Okay.
Now, I'm definitely more confused.
Look, you are raising a smart girl who will be a productive member of society.
That's good.
- Good.
- Great.
Mmm-hmm.
- Great.
- You still feel weird.
- I still feel weird! Mmm.
[chuckling] You know what might help you? To see me in action.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They can both wear dresses to the wedding, - it'll be fine.
- Ramona! - Uh, you wanna go over there? - No! No, no, no, no, no, no.
[chuckles] But just out of curiosity what is that girl doing right now? She's looking at you and biting her lower lip.
[both chuckling] I gotta go.
Hey, parents.
I don't want to alarm you, but the kids may already be dead.
- What the hell you talking about? - What? What are you I got locked out of the room and they're up there jumping on the beds.
Yeah, that's the magic of hotel rooms.
All they want to do is hang out in there.
Yeah, they get excited by tiny soaps and sewing kits.
Kids are so stupid.
[chuckles] Well, maybe I am overreacting.
Yes.
Maybe just for a minute.
[chuckles] Oh, sorry.
That's why I've been so overprotective.
It's what we do.
[chuckles] I think we have some trust issues because Castro and all of that.
[sighs] You know.
But it's good to get an outsider's perspective.
You guys have calmed me down.
Maybe I was being a little suffocating.
I need to talk to you about your kids.
Oh, and you know it.
- [music playing] [sighs] Drinking alone? This is a gay bar.
That's what regular bars are for.
Yeah, but regular bars don't have $7 Queen-a-Coladas.
Mmm, tell me about it.
This is my third Bloody Gary.
Anyway I'm drinking alone 'cause I'm a monster and monsters drink alone.
My daughter came out to me and I am not totally okay with it.
All right, all right.
This is a subject that I know a thing or two about, so talk to me.
It's just that I'm ruining everything.
I want her to have the most perfect coming-out story.
You know, where I'm cool and supportive and we high-five and ride unicorns down a rainbow together.
[chuckles] Okay, so, gay people aren't magic.
But it's a common misconception, so I should be feeling really happy that she feels comfortable enough to come out to me.
But I just keep thinking It's not the way I pictured it.
[chuckles] The pregnancy scare.
I hold her hand while she pees on a stick.
We don't trust that stick, so she pees on a second stick.
It's negative and we go get sushi.
[chuckles] You know, you can still get sushi without peeing on something.
[chuckles] It's not the same.
How long ago did your daughter come out? Thirty-six hours ago.
Thirty-six hours and you're not leading a pride parade? [scoffs] No, but my mom is.
So you're just not there yet.
This is a complete readjustment of how you see your daughter.
Trust me, she's been thinking about this for months or years.
You just found out.
Your heart is okay.
You just need a little time for your head to catch up.
[sighs heavily] [sighs] I feel a thousand times better.
Thank you! Oh! [sniffs] Oh, my God, you smell so good.
- [chuckles] - Well, you're at a gay bar.
And you're super hot.
[chuckles] [chuckles] Again, love what you're saying, but, uh, I'm here with my brother.
He's gay.
And to your point, it took me some time to wrap my head around it.
But now I'm good.
And you will be, too.
Thank you.
Luckily, I was too distracted by how cute you are to hear anything you just said.
What? [chuckles] Shut up.
Can I see you again? Like, over dinner? Okay.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I think this is the first time I've ever been asked out in a gay bar.
- Really? - Yeah.
I've been asked out, like, nine times in the past hour.
Hi, Mom.
You're supposed to be in San Diego.
What happened? Okay, first of all, I wanna point out that Alex is 100% okay.
So there's absolutely no need to panic.
What happened? Nothing.
Nothing? The boys stole two maid's carts and were racing them down the hallway! And I won! Not the point.
I get it.
Fortunately, security found me before anything else happened.
Found you? You weren't with them? - [sighs] - Get the water boards.
You guys, I'm so sorry.
I mean, a maid's cart? More like death wagon.
Tiny soaps you can choke on.
Shower caps that can fly off into your face and suffocate you.
And is that a clean toilet brush? I think not! [sighs] Anyway, now you're gonna yell at me and tell me I'm never allowed near your family.
Just make it quick.
[Schneider sighs] Aw I got in your head.
What? I made you as overprotective and crazy as I am.
Â¡AzÃºcar! [chuckles] But we only forgive once.
God, I feel so much better.
And that is the last time I listen to a bunch of gringo parents.
They do not share our values.
- It sounds like Texas isn't that bad.
- [Carmen] I love it.
I'm really getting into saying y'all.
I'm like a little southern belle.
Y'alvarez.
Can I just give you props for being hella cool about Elena coming out? Thank you, Carmen.
I'm just happy that Elena is such a strong young woman - with a clear sense of herself.
- [chuckles] And she has excellent taste in friends.
Compliments make me kind of queasy, so I'm gonna bounce.
I'm going to the rodeo tomorrow.
Hopefully, one of the clowns will get gored.
[both laughing] I love that little weirdo.
- What? - Yes.
- Dish.
Tell me everything! - [chuckles] Okay, his name is Ben.
I met him at a gay bar.
- What? That's right, I'm cool.
- [both chuckle] He was there with his brother, and he was super cute and easy to talk to, and then he wasn't gay.
And then he asked me out! - Shut up! - I mean, who knows if he'll even call, but it was just exciting, you know, meeting someone new and flirting, making a connection.
I can't wait for that.
[scoffs] Are you kidding? I'm going to tell you everything.
- [chuckles] - Mmm.
So, here's a question.
You and Carmen? [scoffs] Oh, no! We're just best friends.
I mean, she says [mimicking Carmen] "All love is a selfish sickness.
" [sighs] - [normal] Her boyfriend is miserable.
- [both chuckle] [cell phone vibrates] [gasps] Oh, my God! It's Ben! [chuckles] "It was so great meeting you.
Best part of my night.
You play it cool.
I'm texting back.
No, no, Mom, you have to play hard to get! No, I don't wanna play hard to get!
[both moaning] - [horn honks] - [both laugh] [sighs] Is it weird that we're sneaking around to make out like kids when our actual kids are waiting at home? Yeah.
Before I left the house, my 15-year-old told me to tone down the makeup and be home by 11:00.
Ah, screw her.
She's so lame.
That's weird.
" She's three.
Hmm.
[chuckles] I hate to let her down, but I'm more of a seventh-date kind of girl.
Unrelated, do you want to go on two dates tomorrow? [chuckles] Actually, my friends are having a dinner party.
Do you want to come? - [cell phone chimes] - Ay! - Yeah, you're right.
It's too soon.
- No, I wanna come.
This "ay" was for my mom.
Pick up his favorite potato chips.
Take him back, so I can die a happy woman.
" [Ben] Hmm.
So your mom's really into your ex.
That's great.
Victor's in the past.
And I'm putting my phone on silent.
[both] Mmm.
Is her phone on silent, or did you kidnap her?" How does your mom have my number? I don't know.
[theme song playing in Spanish] [Victor over computer] That really happened.
I'm not kidding.
[laughing] Ay, quÃ© bueno, you are home.
We are Skyping a handsome, available man in Afghanistan.
[chuckles] It's Victor.
Your husband? - [Victor] Is that your mami I hear? - Yeah, she wants to say hi.
Hi, Victor! Everything good? Great.
In a minute.
Victor is showing us a picture of a funny camel.
It is very tiny.
It has no humps.
And it is a dog.
So quick question.
When Papi's here next week, do I have to, like, hang out with him? [chuckles] The whole reason he's coming home is for your quinces.
Plus, we haven't seen him in over a year.
And sometimes I just pretend it Look, I get it, - but it's only for a few days.
- [sighs] And, uh, where are we with the idea of telling him? Oh, who thinks it's a good idea to greet my Latino veteran dad with, "Hey, I like girls!" You'll finally have something in common.
So, Lupita, aren't you going to talk to Victor? No.
Right, not the way you look.
Here, you need a lipstick.
- Oh, thank you.
- [lipstick clatters] I am telling you, he is back to how he used to be.
I know he says he's sober, which is great, but he needs to get actual help or the drinking and the pills could start all over again.
His skin is glowing.
Hashtag, no filter.
[sighs] Victor and I are not a thing anymore.
- Okay? You got it? - Of course.
Oh, give him a chance.
Remember how you two used to sing the karaoke? And dance into the night? [gasps] And remember your wedding day? God, I looked beautiful.
Ooh, what are you doing, papito? Since Papi can't be here for my cello recital tomorrow, I'm gonna play my part of the quartet for him.
My God, he is a genius.
[Victor] Oh, yeah.
Wouldn't it be cool if I could do that Star Trek thing where I could just transport there? I'd be all, "Oye, Scotty, beam me up, yo.
" - [knocking at door] - [chuckles] Whoa, it worked.
I was aiming for the living room.
I just missed.
- Papi! - [chuckles] - [thud] - [Victor] You grew! - Papi! - [chuckles] Okay.
Wow, look at you.
Beautiful, huh? You must be breaking all the boys' hearts.
Dame un beso.
[chuckles] [Lydia speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] Okay, let's break it up.
Everyone has told everyone they're attractive.
[chuckles] Hiya, Lupe.
Hi.
Well, this is a surprise, because it's not a week from now.
But it's all good, 'cause I got your many messages and texts telling me you were coming early.
Oh, wait.
I know, I'm early, but I really wanted to surprise papi chulo over here and see his cello show.
- Awesome.
- [chuckles] QuÃ© nice, quÃ© thoughtful Kay Jewelers.
They sell engagement rings.
- And anyway, Lupe, I booked a hotel.
- Okay, that sounds good.
That sounds outrageous.
He is family.
Exactly.
You understand.
You know, we weren't expecting you for another week, and if you just drop in out of the blue like this, you can't really expect us to be ready for you, it's Ready.
Wow.
Is that a pillow mint? [chuckles] Can't Papi stay here, Mami? Yeah, sure.
Â¡Perfecto! You can have my bed.
I will sleep with Lupe.
Unless - No, it's fine.
Gracias.
- Claro.
Victor made breakfast.
He told me to relax.
Isn't he marvelous? Someone should take him off the market.
- Toma, Lupe.
- Oh.
- Good morning, Elena.
Clown face pancakes.
Huh? Let me guess, you don't like clowns anymore.
Or faces.
I just like to start with a protein because studies show it's better for developing brain Clown pancakes, what? It's about to be a circus in my stomach.
[chuckles] That's what I meant to say.
Yeah.
Oh, uh Quick, before you go to school, I have something for you guys.
I didn't get a chance to do this last night.
Dang! A new PS4! Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
Thanks.
Of course you can't play it unless your homework's done and only when Mami says it's okay.
And I'm just realizing I should've asked her before I even gave it to you, so now I'm just gonna stare this way and you tell me what her face is doing.
- You can keep it.
- Yes.
But if you mess up, it goes up on the shelf no one can reach.
- RIP Super Soaker.
But a Latina princess.
Yeah.
And she's all, like, empowered.
Yeah, she don't need no prince.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Thank you.
[chuckles] Hi, princess.
My body proportions aren't representative" of a typical girl my age.
" [in normal voice] At least you know.
Yeah.
And and she comes with a purse, and, uh, pajamas and, um, a receipt.
Solid effort.
Come on, you guys.
Let's go.
You gotta go.
- [Lydia] I'm going to go, too.
I will leave you two alone.
- Where are you going? - Grocery shopping.
At 7:00 in the morning? I like to beat the traffic.
- You're walking.
- Foot traffic.
It must be nice to have someone to help out, go grocery shopping.
Oh, yeah.
Or leaving.
[sighs] So You're making breakfast, you're being thoughtful.
What are you doing? Just trying to be a decent dude.
I'm not the same person I was before I left.
- I mean, I'm still crazy cute.
- [scoffs] But, uh, I'm off the pills.
I'm sober now.
Been working a program.
And the other stuff, the PTS? I'm dealing with it.
I'm in a good place, Lupe.
I'm a new guy.
Trying to be, anyway.
Good.
Good.
I'm in a good place, too.
Which Ay, so, look.
What? Who is he? I'm gonna kick his ass.
Is what the old Victor would have said.
Right? Yeah.
But the new Victor says, "Get it, girl.
" - Okay.
[laughing] - It's all good.
I'm just telling you because I don't want it to be weird.
Although it was weird that you told me to get it.
- So you're cool? Well, I don't love it.
[scoffs] I mean, who is this guy? Is he a big part of your life? Hey, Pen! Which shirt do you think is better for the cello recital? I feel like the green one really brings out my eyes.
But then I thought it might be fun if we did a "the whole family wears blue" thing.
Hi, I'm Victor.
Is this the guy you're seeing? [both laughing] [both] Oh, my God! - You think he and I? - Like we would ever! [both laughing] Oh, my.
Whoo! I needed that.
Oh, man.
Me, too.
I'm Schneider, by the way.
[clears throat] She never told me you were so funny.
So you're just the guy who takes my son out to baseball and does all that dad stuff? [laughing] Are we still laughing? - I'm not.
- I am.
'Cause I'm afraid to stop.
You know what, I gotta be honest, I think I was happier when I thought you were sleeping with my wife.
Oh, sure, yeah.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
How did I get here? I'm gonna go.
Okay.
But we'll see you at Alex's recital, right? Oh Yeah, I just remembered I double-booked with another middle school concert.
[chuckles] Recital season, am I right? Schneider.
Come on, don't be ridiculous.
Of course you're coming.
You'll both be there, and it'll be a good chance to get to know each other.
Yeah.
I insist.
Sounds fun.
Strangers in the night Exchanging glances Wondering in the night What were the chances We'd be sharing love Oh, man.
These people really need better entertainment.
- Or worse hearing aids.
- [chuckles] Look at you two, all over each other like the old days.
[laughs] Remember, love is the thing that keeps you warm in the night.
It is the quilt of passion.
Are you okay there, buddy? Yep, yep, yep.
Glad to be here as a family acquaintance to support your son.
[clears throat] What's his name? Alvin? I don't know.
We're not that close.
Hey, great job coaching Alex's swing this season.
Widening his stance really made him a monster at the plate.
You must be so proud.
He lives here.
Listen, man, relax.
It's good, what you're doing for Alex.
I'm not around.
You should keep doing it.
Although I won't be over there much longer.
- You won't? - Nah.
Private security in Afghanistan? I mean, it's not exactly the kind of job you can grow old in.
[scoffs] Yeah, I know.
You were right.
- Mom.
- What? What's wrong? Mrs.
Aaron's van got a flat, and she was moving all the instruments.
I don't have my cello.
I don't have my Jell-O either.
This sucks.
Bad news, everyone.
You never get to be here for my stuff.
- We have to do something.
- What do you mean? We gotta stall.
I didn't come all this way to not hear my boy play the cello.
Schneider, I have a mission for you.
I need you to locate and recover that van, and retrieve those instruments ASAP.
You got it, Dad.
I mean, dude.
Are you in, Sergeant Alvarez? What do you have in mind, Sergeant Alvarez? All right, everyone, uh, before you all leave, I happened to notice your karaoke machine.
And we have a very special guest who's played - [piano music playing] - showers from Echo Park to Afghanistan, Penelope Alvarez! You got this.
Let's give them a show.
Turn around Every now and then I get a little bit lonely And you're never coming round [Victor] Turn around You know, I should be embarrassed, but Mom and Dad are kinda cute up there.
- I did this.
- [Victor] Turn around A total eclipse of the heart Turn around bright eyes Turn around bright eyes Whoo-hoo! Thank you, active seniors of Silver Lake! Do you want to hear it a fourth time? I didn't hear it the first three times.
Oh, and now, I couldn't be prouder to introduce the St.
Bibiana String Quartet, starring cello superstar, Alex Alvarez.
You glad you came back early for this? We messed up on a lot, but, uh I know a couple of things we got right.
[sobbing] - Whoo-hoo! - [all laughing] [Lydia] Oh! We were so awesome! [Victor] Wow.
Yeah.
I mean, we probably added five years to those old-timers' lives.
And papito, you were the best one in that quartet.
I mean, that's why they gave you the biggest violin.
Thanks.
Can we set up the PS4 now? I don't know.
Oh, uh, but first I have something for Elena.
- [Lydia] Ooh.
- Um, yeah, I'm sorry about the doll.
Uh, I know sometimes I still think that you're a little girl.
But you've changed.
And I haven't been so good at keeping up.
But I want to.
A donation to Kiva in my name! Why are you giving money to a guy named Kiva when you could be giving money to a guy named Alex? Oh, Kiva is an organization that gives a loan to a small business in a developing nation.
[Victor chuckles softly] A a social justice warrior.
Same thing.
Anyway, I don't know exactly how this works, but if we're ever in Tibet, we can visit a kickass yak dairy.
[squeals] Thanks, Papi! But we're still sharing that PS4.
I like video games, too.
Girls like video games, too.
- Don't you even.
- [Victor chuckles] I'm in, too.
[chuckles] Aw, it's true love.
I'm sure Juliet forgot her date with Romeo.
[Penelope] Aw.
Okay.
Let me get outta here.
- And I'll see you guys later.
- [both] Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
Just like I used to beat you in Connect Four.
[Elena and Victor] Ooh.
[Victor] Tough talk, huh, papito? I actually got called to duty, so there's no way you can beat me at this game.
And Elena, you can't cheat in this game like you do in Scrabble.
[Elena] For the last time, seax is a real word.
- It's a Scandinavian roofer's tool.
- [Alex chuckles] [Victor] Wow.
You make Papi feel real dumb sometimes.
Tonight was fun, right? Yeah.
It was nice to have someone to share the load.
[chuckles] Listen, I I hope we're on our way to being good, you know, which is why I got a present for you, too.
- The divorce papers.
- Yeah.
I know you've been after me to sign them, so I did.
Once you do, it'll be official.
[sighs] Ay.
[Victor sighs] Have fun at your thing.
- That was great, wasn't it? - Oh, so great.
I absolutely loved your friends.
I can't believe that Emily and I went to the same grade school.
And we both mistrust the balloon guy at the farmer's market, 'cause that guy is full-on sketchy.
[chuckles] Sebastian and Peter are so cute.
Their wedding pictures were so romantic.
Love wins! We have to break up.
It's not pretty.
It's not that.
[sighs] I just have a lot going on right now, you know.
Between the quinces, my family coming into town, my ex being back It's not fair to you.
If I can't be here, I shouldn't be here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And your ex being back.
So we're stopping after six dates.
Perfect! [chuckles] You watching me sleep, creepy lady? [chuckling] I should've known something was up.
You weren't snoring.
[chuckles] How was your thing? It was fine.
Home by 11:00? I don't think so.
Why are you with such a snooze, huh? We know you have good taste.
[sighs] Ay.
Well, if you must know, I broke up with him.
Was I smiling? You better look closer.
No, no, no, no.
Come on, no.
None of that.
Come on, I swear, I just wanna spoon.
[scoffs] Oh, yeah.
You just wanna spoon? I invented that move.
Come on, let's just cuddle, naked.
Come on.
Just for a minute.
[both sigh heavily] So, thanks for the divorce papers.
Yeah, I can't wait to get you outta my life.
[chuckles] Oh, God, it's just so weird.
[sighs] Mami's convinced that we should get back together.
Ah, that viejita's no dummy.
- What? - Why do you smell like beer? Oh, uh, I had a few before bed.
No, no, no, no.
- Yeah! 'Cause that's part of working the program, right? Look, it's not that kind of program.
All right? What the hell kind of program is it, Victor? Okay, look, you're gonna have to trust me on this.
All right? I'm doing my own thing.
And it And it's working.
I promise.
Yeah, it seems like it's working.
Uh, listen, Penelope.
[sighs] Don't joke about this! You lied to me! No, I didn't lie, okay? I told you that I'm better and I am.
You're not gonna give me credit for that? No, I'm not.
No.
Not with your history, and not what we've been through.
You need to be in a real program.
Oh, what, at the VA? So I can wait a month to talk to some comemierda who's never even seen a second of combat? No, I don't think so.
I'm not doing that.
Oh, so so just to be clear you're not seeing anyone about your PTS? Look, I'm doing stuff, okay? Look, I'm keeping busy.
- All right? I can't believe I let you do this to me again.
Stop! Stop overreacting over a few beers.
- Overreacting? - Please! How many beers was it when you punched a hole in the wall above the bed, huh? How many beers was it when you woke the kids up in the middle of the night to say goodbye 'cause Daddy was gonna kill himself? Huh? I'm not saying this to hurt you.
I am saying this because I love you and I know who you are in here.
I remember who you were.
You've been through some hard stuff, babe, and and that's not your fault, but you need real help.
I'm helping myself! I'm doing what I'm doing, okay? And if you don't like it, well, then, that's your problem.
[Penelope sighs] Yeah, you're right.
So, you gotta go.
Stay at that hotel.
And the next time I see you is gonna be at Elena's quinces.
- All right.
Hey, look, I'm I'm sorry.
- No! - Come on, Lupe.
- Please! Just go.
Okay.
Por favor.
Huh? No, Victor.
Go.
Eh? Mom, a tiara is a backward symbol of how women are only valued for their beauty.
And now that I'm wearing one I don't care.
I look awesome.
And it's super sparkly! - [shrieks] - [both laugh] I'm so glad you like it.
'Cause tomorrow's your quinces, and your only job is to be happy.
And you hear that rumble? Oh, yeah.
That's the sound of 183 Cubans arriving in Los Angeles.
Seventeen of whom will be staying in this room.
Er fire code-wise, I don't think that's gonna Shut it! I am going on no sleep and five Cuban coffees.
Do you really want to mess with me right now? [softly] No, ma'am.
As head of transpo you have one job.
Get the Cubans to and from the airport.
I hope you brushed up on your Spanish.
I want it on the record that your tone is very annoying.
[scoffs] [in English] Okay.
You're kidding me, right? The day of my quinces, you screamed at TÃ­a Mirtha because she brought hot pink balloons instead of fuchsia.
Fuchsia is a royal color! Hot pink is what a girl wears on a spring break, before flashing her tetas.
[arguing in Spanish] [both arguing in Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Oye, why aren't you filming this? You want me to film you two arguing? I have hours of that.
In here.
Elena, your dress is in the closet.
If you should happen to find a straightjacket there, please bring it out here, for your crazy mami.
Pen, are you kidding me? You guys are like family.
Tick tock.
I just Mami, I really need this all to go perfectly.
Elena's been through so much this year.
I mean, the divorce, she came out to us, her creepy little goth friend moved away.
Ah, pobrecita Carmen.
So whatever Elena wants for her quinces, she gets.
Tres leches cake? I got you.
And look at this seating chart.
What! I mean, I'm a humble woman, but that's art there.
And that reminds me, Victor's cousin Macho is bringing his girlfriend.
Mami, we said no girlfriends.
Apparently, they are in love.
Okay.
Fine, I got it.
We're gonna move you to the Frida Kahlo table, and the Oprah Winfrey table will go from eight seats to ten.
Between growing up Cuban and Catholic, I've got everything pushed way down.
You're welcome, mija.
Anyway, Victor knows I don't want to see him until the quinces.
And the kids still think he's staying at Schneider's because your bed hurt his back.
Bueno.
Yo [both exclaiming in Spanish] [Elena shrieks] Ooh.
[laughing] Thank you so much, Abuelita.
It's beautiful.
Exactly.
You are not sobbing with joy.
I have failed you.
I have failed my family.
I have failed Cuba.
[theme song playing in Spanish] Everything is all set for tomorrow.
And I just want to say, you have chosen the perfect ballroom.
Penelope.
Oh.
The toast is kinda my thing.
So maybe you don't speak.
Don't worry, Leslie.
Elena's quinces is going to be a very special day for everyone.
[shudders] No.
Don't film that.
Excuse me.
[speaks Spanish] Hey.
Hey, Lucy.
I'm sorry about her.
Let me translate.
She would like a larger dance floor.
Give the lady a bigger floor.
- Papi.
- Hey.
Hi.
You're here.
Yeah.
I asked Papi to come so we could practice our father-daughter dance.
Oh.
Yeah, we have to do something really good to distract the audience because the song is super cheesy.
- [Spanish song playing over cell phone] - Ay, Julio.
Let them do that.
[song continues playing] Don't worry.
I found a more modern version for us to dance to.
Oh, I kinda like this one.
Me, too.
It's about, uh, how you look away for a second and you turn back and - your little girl's all grown up.
- [both chuckle] It's actually getting to me.
[sighs] Papi, I want to tell you something.
That I'm the greatest dancer you've ever seen? [whispers] I know.
And I've changed.
- Well, not changed, but, um - Mmm-hmm.
I'm gay.
[chuckles] Yeah, and you're pregnant, too, right? [chuckling] Let's do all the shockers.
[stammers] No.
Papi, I'm I'm serious.
I came out while you were gone and I was just waiting for the right time to tell you.
I don't understand.
No, I'm not mad.
You're just confused.
I mean, you're 15.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
- [song stops] - What's going on? I told him.
Did you know about this? Yeah.
Just give us a sec.
Are you indulging whatever this is? Uh, you mean supporting our daughter? Yeah, I am.
What the hell's been going on here? Wow.
[scoffs] Okay.
Look, I didn't know she was gonna tell you, but now that she did, you're gonna have to figure out a way to be okay with it.
No, I don't have to be okay with anything.
She's mixed up, and you're her mother.
You aren't even trying to talk some sense into her? That's not how this works.
Oh, so we're all just supposed to pretend like this is cool? Because it's not.
All right? It's not.
Kinda worried he's not gonna come.
What? No.
No, he just needs a minute.
He's not good with change.
You should have seen him the first time he saw me without makeup.
Whoa! "Who are you right now? - "Why don't you have eyebrows?" - [chuckles] [speaking Spanish] Gracias.
[speaks Spanish] Don't freestyle.
Stick with the picture.
Yeah, but don't worry.
I take little power naps when I pee.
[panting] Maybe you should lie down.
[mockingly] "Maybe you should lie down.
" What's happening? [sighs] Sorry.
There's just a lot to do.
And people say they want to help and friggin' Tina's over there doing her own thing, like she always does.
Keep your eye on her.
Alvarez.
Uh sorry you can't come to the quinces, but glad you could make it to the final fitting.
Elena wanted me to weigh in on her dress.
It's gorgeous.
La Diabla lies.
I have tried everything.
I have taken away the frills, I have put on the frills, I have made it longer, I have made it shorter.
But she is being impossible.
Maybe what you're picking up on, is that I'm not really comfortable wearing a dress.
Of course, you are not comfortable.
It's called being a woman.
I am in agony all of the time, but I look amazing.
Not sure this is the lesson I want to be teaching, but I so want to check this box.
[sighs] All I'm saying is that I'm really figuring out what I am comfortable in.
Last week, I went to a thrift store and I got some jackets, some ties, a fedora, a pinstripe suit.
What? You want to look like Al Capone? Ooh, what about this? What about, instead of heels I wear my Doc Martens? I mean, all everybody else would see is the dress, but underneath there'd be one thing that's a little more me.
No more changes.
[Elena chuckles] You got it, okay! You're killing me.
Tina, baby's breath? Stop sneaking in unapproved flowers.
That's my boy.
All right, here's your last three Alvarezes.
De nada.
Can an hombre get a pastelito up in this boca? I learned more words.
[chuckles] - Hola.
- Gracias.
[both speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] [in English] I don't know these people.
- What? - Yeah.
You picked up the wrong Alvarezes.
Did you not look at the photos I gave you? I did.
But I don't want to be racist, so let's say I didn't.
All right.
Back to el Range Rover.
Hey, Pen? - [whispers] Come here.
- Uh-huh? Just so you know, Victor's still upstairs in my apartment.
Yeah, thanks again for taking him in.
- Actually, I think he's leaving.
- What? He was packing up all his stuff while he was telling me about Elena's crazy phase and how everyone's coddling her.
I didn't want to kill the bro vibe we got going on, so I said, "I know, right, bro?" But what I was really thinking was, "Hell no, bro.
That's a no-go.
" So you know.
You're not gonna do something stupid like not come to the quinces tomorrow? "Yeah, cool, Lupe.
I'll be there.
" "Oh, thanks, Victor.
" Look, I know this is all hitting you fast.
I was really thrown at first, too.
This isn't who she is, Lupe.
It's not.
It's a phase.
Oh, yeah.
That's it.
She wants a piece of that sweet bullying and persecution because being a teenager's not hard enough.
You know what? I'm not joking.
And I'm not here to fight with you.
Because this is not about us right now.
This is about your daughter.
And I know you love her.
[door closes] She's only told a few people.
All right.
Well, that's good.
Don't tell anyone else.
- I'm not gonna tell anyone else.
- Good.
Because it's not up to me.
Or you.
Â¿Un pastelito? Â¿Un pastelito? Penelope, hola.
Â¿Un pastelito? Doc, I feel like I keep asking you this, but what are you doing here? I'm not sure.
I thought I would see everyone at the quinces tomorrow but, uh your mom told me to come over tonight.
[gags] Don't do that.
- Mom, don't freak out.
- What happened? It's gonna be fine.
But TÃ­a Mimi just got a call, and you know the Fajardos? Rosita, Diana, Marta, Cristina, Juanito and Baby Juanito? Can't come because of a baptism on Rosita's mother's side? They're coming.
Oh, come on! I should have known better.
Cristina was pregnant with Baby Juanito for 11 months, and she still thinks he was premature.
I don't know if we can fit in any more tables.
We are not adding another table.
I can make this work.
[gasps] I don't feel safe.
[gasps] [Penelope screams] Gracias, estoy bien.
Dr.
Berkowitz, would you mind helping me pick this up? Oh, absolutely.
Don't drag me down with you, buddy.
Oh, uh, Leslie.
Come into my room, please.
Oh, I can't deal with this right now.
No! There's no way you're gonna be able to fix this in time.
Oh, I'm about to go A Beautiful freaking Mind up in this bitch.
I'm kinda scared of you right now, so I'm gonna leave.
Yeah, it's a Jekyll-Hyde situation, so you should run.
[grunts and pants] I got one last pickup.
You.
What is going on? The Cubans are missing, my seating chart is gone and I'm kind of attracted to you? Nothing makes sense.
Chill, girl.
Oh, that helps when you talk.
Thank you.
I am here to take you to your daughter's quinces.
So, get in that bedroom and put on all your clothes.
How did this happen? Who's in charge? It's handled, boo.
Nice work, Jay.
Tina, there's no confetti on Frida Kahlo.
Ay, Dios mÃ­o.
[sighs] Okay.
Now I'm in heaven.
Immigrants.
We get the job done.
Muy bien hecho.
All is forgiven.
Yeah, most is forgiven.
Okay.
Have you seen your papi? No.
But I'm seeing too much of something.
Hey! Everything looks amazing.
And your papi's here.
In ink.
[stammers] But it's just a few tweaks.
You won't even notice.
I should not have said anything.
- [Elena sighs] - Mira.
[sobbing and laughing] I [laughs] [Lydia] Oh! [gasps] Now, that is the response I have been waiting for.
Next time, don't make me jump through the hoops.
Hey, everybody.
[sighs] Victor and I would like to thank you all for coming.
And I'm probably gonna cry, so deal with it, mi gente.
August 7, 2001.
The doctor said Elena was due August 15th, but you know her, she ain't lettin' no man tell her when she gonna get birthed.
[all laughing] Elena has always been her own girl and now she's becoming her own woman.
When she was in third grade, she played the cherry tree in a school play.
And when George Washington swung his ax, she hit him back and yelled, "Trees are people, too!" [all laughing] And that's Elena.
Always sticking up for the underdog.
Okay, I can't hold it together anymore, so let's just bring the court out here! [all cheering] And now, let's welcome the girl of the hour Oh, I mean, the woman of the hour Elena Maria Alvarez Riera CalderÃ³n Leytevidal Inclan.
[upbeat music playing] [all cheering and whooping] Thank you.
Gracias.
You're welcome.
Are you ready? Are you sure? Carmen! Oh! What are you doing here? Schneider flew me out.
[slow song playing] How do you know all the steps? Your abuelita Skyped me every day for three months.
She was so mean, she made me cry.
I loved it.
[pop music playing] [all applaud and cheer] - Ah! [laughs] - Wow! What about the suit, huh? It was perfect.
And I could never have done it without Leslie.
- What? - Well, last night your mother said, "If you can suture, you can sew.
" So, I helped her make Elena's suit.
I was on a deadline.
I needed his nimble fingers.
Oh, such a talent! It's a shame you wasted your life as a doctor.
Okay.
QuÃ© sucia.
All right, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please, turn your attention to the dance floor for the father-daughter dance.
[applause] [guitar music playing] I got you.
I'm okay, you guys.
Thank you both for making me have a quinces.
I have to admit, this is pretty great.
" Eat it up, 'cause we're not doing this again until your wedding.
Oh, I'm never getting married, so [sing-song] I can't hear you.
The music's too loud! [salsa music playing]
Dale, Dylan, dale.
You got this! Stand right in there, don't be afraid of the ball.
- [THUDS] - [ALL GROAN] Just shake it off, Dylan! Shake it off! Yes! Way to take one for the team! Ay, por el amor de Dios it is so hot.
[SIGHS] - All right, Mami, let's do the wave.
- Okay.
[PENELOPE] Okay, let's eat.
Mami, comida.
Okay, the rice and the frijoles are in the pickle jar - and the lechÃ³n is in the butter tub - Mm-hmm.
and the cookies are in the cookie tin, but they are not the same cookies that came with the tin.
- We forgot the napkins.
- Ah! Grab some from the snack bar.
They make you buy something, so one of you needs to create a distraction.
Elena, do that thing and ask if there's high-fructose corn syrup in the ketchup.
- [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] I've been taking Spanish classes on the DL so I can be a more productive member of the family.
No offense.
Why would I be offended? You're not family.
You know I hate that joke.
Anyway, I always thought I was homolingual, turns out I'm bi.
Now I'm a little offended.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] He thinks you're my daughter.
There's something wrong with your ojos, hombre.
I mean, he's clearly a white guy and I'm clearly Latinx.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Latinx is a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina.
Okay.
And I'm clearly too young to have a 16-year-old.
- Actually - We're both offended! [BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH] [BOTH CHUCKLE] Spanish isn't exactly totes bueno so, if you want, I can teach you.
- Yeah, I don't think so.
Here we go, Mami.
- Okay.
- Here we go, papito! - [ALL CHEERING] Come on, dale, bring Dylan home.
Go! Go! [GASPS] - Yes! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [ALL CHEERING] [ALL] Dale, papito, dale! Dale, papito, dale! Dale, papito, dale! Ooh! - That's new.
Where'd you get that from? - Walmart.
Dale, papito, dale! [THEME SONG PLAYING] [WHOOPS] What a game, papito! [LAUGHING] Hello, Dodgers? You want Alex Alvarez? We'll think about it! [ALL LAUGHING] A lot of your games are a real snooze, but today was good! - And then you got that hit! - Dale! [ALL] Dale, papito, dale! Dale, papito, dale! Whoo, look who's suddenly a sports fan.
Oh! It's not that.
I'm just proud of my heritage.
Dale means "go ahead" or "you go.
" It's slang, so it's kind of fluid.
Very Cuban.
You're Canadian! Papito is the best From the east into the west He's a baseball slugger And a real good hugger Oh! That is so cute and so true! - I just made it up! - I love it! Papito is the best From the east into the west He's a baseball slugger And a really good hugger Oh, my God, shut up! Did you just say shut up to God? Did you just say shut up to me? Because that's worse.
Everything you are doing is embarrassing! That's not getting me on your side.
Well, I don't like all that crazy yelling you guys do at my games! And that song, I hate that stupid First of all, don't talk to me like that.
Second you hate that song? Okay, that's crazy.
That is a beautiful song.
My dad never came to my games.
All he ever did was put me through rehab six times and buy me this building.
Look, all I know is, none of the other parents act like you.
Come on, it's all because we're proud of you, papito.
And stop calling me papito! I'm not a little kid anymore.
My name is Alex, okay? No more papito.
- We'll call you papito.
- I will call you papito.
We call Conrad "Macho" because when he was four, he sang "Macho Man" once.
We call Francisco "Pepe Popo.
" Figure that out.
I'm called Tata, Lupita, Yoyi.
And my nickname is Pucha.
It is the way of our people! If you don't have a nickname, there's something wrong with you.
- Do I have a nickname? - No.
Anyway, it's a tradition to call you papito, so we're gonna keep doing it, okay, papito? No! You need to stop it and all the embarrassing stuff you guys do at my games.
You can't give yourself a nickname.
The Amazing Schneider-Man disagrees.
No, we're all still going to the games.
I don't know what's gotten into Alex.
He must be tired.
No, no, Lupita.
I know what this is.
Papito is making the turn.
Our sweet little Alejandro.
[SIGHS] Where did the tiempo go? RIP, papito.
He's not dead.
Isn't he though? Don't worry.
It's so much easier after they've grown.
You do everything through the lawyers.
It's been rough.
Alex is being really hard on me.
Definitely.
Anything.
Whenever possible, treat him like an adult.
If he wants to be called Alex, call him Alex.
Instead of a hug, maybe just try a cool-guy head nod.
'Sup? Maybe he doesn't want to hang out with you as much.
That's okay.
Holding on too tight is not going to keep it from happening.
[SIGHS] You're right.
[CHUCKLES] That's great advice, Doc.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
[CRYING] Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [GASPING] I'm sorry! It's just like, what you said, it made it all just hit me.
My baby being gone and turning into a man.
Why'd you say that, Doc? I'm sorry! I was just trying to help! - Don't tell your mother I made you cry.
- [SOBS] I swear it was just yesterday he was a little boy, and I loved it so much.
Next time I ask if you want my advice, just go like [EXCLAIMS] Everybody's leaving me.
Alex will be out of the house, married to his wife with her spray-tanned legs and fake boobs.
I know his type.
And then it'll just be me in my apartment with my mom.
Hey, if I'm lucky, maybe I could take her off your hands.
So I'll just be alone? I'm going to stop talking.
Oh, my God.
He is so cute.
I know I'm acting crazy.
I just Right now I just want to hold Alex and hug him forever.
[CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? I'm gonna kill that kid.
- It's not that big a deal! - Check your tone.
What happened? His class went on a field trip to the observatory, and he punched a kid from another school.
Papito! Is your hand okay? You know, I've had enough of you and your teen crap.
I'm not raising a jerk.
I'm not a jerk! The other kid's the jerk! Everyone's a jerk! It is still not okay to punch them! Whatever.
Because how is this okay? Did he hit you first? He was saying stuff! Okay, so what? So what, he called you a name? What? Stupid, dummy, goober? What grade do you think I'm in? Listen, if papito punched somebody, there is a good reason for it.
Did he prevent you from seeing the Jupiter exhibit? Because that thing is amazing.
Was it about a woman? It's okay if it was about a woman.
No, Mami, it's not.
He said, "Go back to Mexico!" So, this was just some random kid? Yeah.
Hugo and I were talking in Spanish, and the kid walked by with his friends and heard us and said it.
And, I don't know, I just lost it.
Okay.
There's nothing you can do.
None of the teachers even saw him say it.
Then after I hit him, Sister Barbara pulled me aside and him and his friends took off.
Alex, we're gonna figure this out, but you can't hit somebody every time they call you a name.
I don't! It was just this time! - Wait, this has happened before? - Yeah.
What did they say? You know, beaner, wetback, gangbanger, Pitbull.
Pitbull's the only one that's even close to accurate! Does this happen at school? No.
Just a couple of times when I'm out.
It's so stupid! Whatever.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
No, Mami, let's give him a minute.
Well, we gotta do something.
This is racist! Should we call the police? Wait, the army! No! Oprah! She'll know what to do.
Gracias for your anger, Schneider.
It is adorable.
[SCOFFS] I mean, what the hell? This is America! Yeah, this is America.
Well, I know it happens.
I'm a very aware Canadian-x person.
I know racism's a thing, but we live in LA.
It doesn't happen here.
And now that I've said that out loud, I wish I hadn't.
Yeah, because it happens here.
Yeah, maybe just a dirty look or someone saying, "Keep your voice down," which we all know is code for "Latinos are too loud.
" It's called passion! Turn it down, Mami.
Finally, you say, "Not today!" But nobody saw the other 100 times this crap happened.
They just see the one time you lose it.
Yeah, and ever since somebody decided to call an entire group of Latinos rapists and criminals, everyone thinks they can say whatever racist thought occurs to them.
So what, we're going backwards? That's it, tomorrow I'm getting on Twitter and putting a stop to all of this.
Most of it is so stupid.
People lump us all together.
I mean "beaner"? It's more of a Mexican slur.
Yes! How dare they call us Mexican! Not what we're mad about, Mami.
We are the true beaners! Not what we're mad about, Mami.
- Know what word makes me see red? Lazy.
- Oh Yeah, that just brings up "siesta" and "you people don't want to work hard.
" Yeah, I mean, either we're taking all your jobs or we're lazy.
Pick one! Thank you.
By the way, get a job.
[EXHALES] I get it.
[CLEARS THROAT, CLICKS TONGUE] There's a word people sometimes call me, too.
But you hear how it sounds? It's just dripping with privileged, rich, pale, uncool, bad dancer, Maroon Five fan which is crazy 'cause Maroon Five is the best! Sorry.
I don't know where these stereotypes come from.
Well, I have been called the worst thing that a person could ever be called.
Mami, what was it? The A-word? - The B-word? - [WHISPERS] The C-word? What? No, what are those words? No, no, no, no, no.
This word is so bad that I can hardly bring myself to say it.
- Okay.
- I will say it.
For educational purposes the word is Schneider, can you stand next to me, 'cause I am going to faint.
Here we go.
And the word is - Can I have a glass of - Mami, just say it! Spic! [GASPS] [PANTS] What? Did you not hear me say spic? - Yeah.
- [SCHNEIDER] We heard you.
No, Mami, that is definitely a bad slur.
But, you know what's weird? - You don't really hear that one anymore.
- I don't think I've ever heard it.
- What is it again? - Spic.
[EXCLAIMS] I'm sorry, Mami.
Because of my perfect legs.
" But then, your friend Valentina tells you, "No, no.
In fact, it is a hate word.
" And then suddenly, you feel very alone.
[SHAKILY] And it stays here.
- [SIGHS DEEPLY] - Mami, I'm sorry.
- Words can be very powerful.
- [SNIFFLES] Yeah, I mean, I feel really bad for Alex.
- What? - No, and hopefully you never will.
Yeah, but why are you being weird? I'm not being weird.
All right, look Um you and your brother are of different shades.
Yes.
Papito is a beautiful caramel and you are Wonder Bread.
- Am I passing? - No! Well What do you mean "passing"? It's when people of color pass as Caucasian and benefit from white privilege even though they're a minority.
Well, that's a big old sÃ­ then, seÃ±orita.
Huh? Let me explain.
[GROANS] Mami, Cubans are everything.
But we are mostly descended from white Spaniards.
How many Cubans do we know who are black? And how many Cubans do we know who are blond? [LAUGHS] [WHISPERS] A lot of them.
Saying we're white, brown, black, that's beside the point.
Exactly.
[WHISPERS] We are white.
I can't believe this.
You're saying I'm going to go through my whole life without being oppressed at all? Okay, you know that wouldn't be a bad thing, right? Yeah, I guess.
Someone told Alex to go back to another country, as though he doesn't belong in this one.
Do you know how screwed up that is for a 13-year-old boy? I don't even know what to tell him.
Oh [SIGHS] - I want to learn more Spanish.
- I'll set up a lesson plan.
Not from you! Will you teach me, Abuelita? Gracias a Dios.
I knew this day would come.
Oh, wait, can you teach me, too? Of course! And when I am done, you both can pass as Cubans.
- Yay! - Hey! Hey, you.
And I'm sorry all this stuff is happening.
I just want to go back to the way it was.
It's like all of a sudden I'm different? I don't want to be different.
Wait is that why you don't want us to come to the games? So it's not because we're crazy and treat you like a baby? Well, I don't love that.
But, mostly it's because we're too Cuban, right? I mean, I'm proud of being Cuban, but yeah.
- Sorry.
- [CHUCKLES] It's okay.
I get it.
And who you are is Cuban and American and mostly a sweet kid who doesn't hurt people.
You can't control the jerks but you can control your reaction to them.
Because this is your country, too, and you deserve to be happy in it.
But if you get angry, they win.
Okay.
[SNIFFLES] [SNIFFS] Actually, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
There is one thing that completely stops the effects of racism.
- You're right, Mom.
You need a Latinx.
Elena, what did you get? Vanilla? No! But I was able to do my whole order in Spanish! - Hey! Nice.
- Hey! Dale, blanquita, dale.
Ah-ah-ah.
[ALL] Dale, blanquita, dale.
- No! Don't call me blanquita! - Hey, you've got a nickname! Oh, yeah! [LAUGHS] - [ALL] Dale, blanquita, dale! - [EXCLAIMS] - Dale, blanquita, dale! - Excuse me! I know you're having a little fiesta over here, but you should learn to keep your voice down.
There are other people in here.
Mami, would you hold my helado, please.
And I am the lady's mother.
Not her sister.
Question.
Are you the owner of this establishment? - No.
- So then you must know that we have just as much a right to be here as you.
You were being very loud.
Yeah, I noticed you used the word fiesta.
Would you care to comment on that? - Poor choice of words maybe but - Yes, I agree.
You know what else was a poor choice of words? The other words you said to me and my family.
Because this isn't a library.
We were over there having a nice time, but for some reason, you decided that meant I was all, "Arriba! Arriba! Arriba!" That's not me.
How dare you stereotype us! I was born right here, in this country.
I'm an American.
Cuban-American.
And we come in all shapes, sizes and colors.
Mostly white.
Now you and your wife have a good night.
Still think you should keep your voice down.
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah, well, agree to disagree, sir! - That was awesome, Mom.
- [EXHALES DEEPLY] You see, if you get angry, they win.
If you never get angry, they also win.
It's complicated.
The point is, I didn't hit anybody, and we all got ice cream.
[ALL] Dale, Lupita, dale.
- [PENELOPE] Thank you.
- [LYDIA WHOOPS] [ALL] Dale, Lupita, dale.
And in case anybody else wants to know what's up? This Latin-American family is headed to their American home.
That is so cool.
Anne Hathaway just totally stood up for those Mexicans.
 [LATIN MUSIC PLAYING] - Mami! - [SCREAMS, PANTING] Mami, where's my biology textbook? I was studying, then I fell asleep for two seconds, and it was gone.
Does it have a tree and an Earth - and the lightning? - Yes! - It's in your hand.
Wait, wait, wait, what day is it? I showered on Thursday, so today must be [SNIFFS] Monday.
[GROANS] Mami! I have so much to put in my brain before tomorrow.
Why? Why does a nurse practitioner have to know about the life cycle of plants? I'm not trying to give CPR to a carrot! And we're out of coffee! And I don't have time to go shopping, because after work, I'll probably have to drive Elena to another one of her gay protests.
I'm not trying to be insulting but a lot of them are about gay stuff.
And then, after my test, I have to take papito to his cello lesson.
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we pay his cello teacher? Because she sent me three e-mails, and now I'm not sure what we owe.
I don't trust that lady, Ma.
It started off as a shower, but then I fell asleep.
I even managed to shave one leg.
I'm coming for you next, lefty.
What, what is this? When I said take the trash out, I meant out of the apartment, not out of the can.
Maybe you can show me for next time.
Maybe I can give your PlayStation to Goodwill.
I don't have time to argue, all right? Let's go.
Elena! Man, you guys are moving slower than phosphorous through biomass! - Yes! - Oh! Did you make the appointment to get my braces off? - [GROANS] - You said you'd do it two weeks ago.
All right, all right.
Let me put it on the to-do list.
Mom, after school can you drive me to march with the Lesbians Against Fracking? I'm sorry, baby, there's no way.
There's no way that's a real thing.
Queer women don't like our tap water catching fire any more than anyone else does.
It really matters! I know, baby, but so did the Women's March, the Immigration March, the Science March Ay, listen to your mother.
This is march madness! You know, I did like the Women's March.
I looked very nice in that pink pussycat hat.
Hey, guys.
Schneider, would you please knock my eyes out.
What the hell are you wearing? Oh, this? Yeah, it's my new work uniform.
You're hired.
Oh, Lydia, I was actually inspired by you teaching dance to become an educator myself.
I started teaching spinning.
[CHUCKLES] Isn't spinning riding a stationary bike? Why are you wearing a helmet? It's for my own protection.
I may have fallen off a few times.
"Murder Schneider.
" - Come on, let's go.
- Wait, I don't have my lunch.
- I don't either.
- [GASPS] Ay! Papito, lo siento! I forgot.
What about me? I was just so distracted with my dance class.
You're teaching ballet to 5-year-olds.
What do you have to prepare for? Disappointment.
Here is your lunch.
Here you go.
Why does she get 10 bucks and I get 5? Take out the freakin' trash.
Let's go.
I'm sorry, I know I'm late.
Well, no.
Actually, it's 8:00 a.
m.
On time is late.
Sorry, my personal motto isn't, "That's what she said.
" Hey.
My personal motto is, "Swipe right on life.
" So school's really keeping you busy, huh? Yeah, when are you gonna hook me up with some hot coeds? Or are they all returning students? Uh you mean people who are gonna be your boss soon? Yeah, I don't think that's how it works.
Oh, that's exactly how it works, Scott! I'm gonna go do my job.
Make me coffee 'cause I'm gonna be your boss? Yeah, you go do that.
That's what she said! What's wrong? Are you okay? Hey, someone call the doctor! I'm just so worn out.
[SIGHS] I must look like hell.
- You have been looking - Mama don't need to hear that, Doc.
Well, I know where you're coming from.
I don't do very much and Daddy's been exhausted for the last 35 years.
Yeah, let's not keep doing that Mama-Daddy thing.
Can I confess something to you, Doc? Yeah.
[SIGHS] School is hard! I got good grades in high school, but that was my mom.
She used to stand over me while I studied, and if I nodded off, she'd squirt me with a spray bottle.
Says I'm not a man unless I smell like the inside of a boot.
This whole nurse practitioner thing is a real game changer for my whole family.
There's a lot of pressure, and honestly, it is kicking my butt.
And then the professor thanked me for correcting her and the whole class applauded.
[SCOTT GROANS] We get it! I'm sorry.
One of the only joys I have is making sure he knows I am better than him.
You are, girlfriend.
You are Superwoman.
Doc, can I confess something else about school? [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] I'm kind of failing.
[LAUGHS] Right! You failing? I can see that.
"I got an A-minus, oy! Dios mÃ­o.
" Look.
All I know is, I believe in you.
Which is why I've already leased the office next door so we can expand the practice to accommodate all the new patients that you are going to be bringing in.
Surprise! What? That's the face I was looking for! [GASPS] I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, I'm putting all my eggs in Mama's basket.
Alex - [BALLET MUSIC PLAYING] - And chins up, and shoulders back.
ChassÃ©, chassÃ©, chaÃ®nÃ© turn.
Oh, that is so good.
[LAUGHS] Hopeless.
I really need to study.
What happened to finding a space at the church? I would never put God through this.
Everything is very expensive, so I'm going to wait until after you graduate and you get your big raise.
Sasha, no biting! That one is going to make it.
They will never be dancers.
Where's Alex? In my room, practicing the cello.
Oh, hey.
Oh, yeah.
No, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no.
That's my work space.
- Sorry, Mom, I really need the table.
- For what? 'Cause this ain't homework.
Are you gay? I forgot because you haven't mentioned it in the last five minutes.
Papito, trash, cello, then making fun of your sister.
Anyway I'm expecting a big pushback from the Catholic school administration.
I'm getting a jump on the protest.
And I've been practicing my angry, staring-down-nuns look.
That's more a "someone at the office stole my yogurt" face, but you keep working on it.
Not here.
I don't understand why do you need a gay club.
Move on! Abuelita, what if someone told you not to talk about being Cuban? I would kick them in the aguacates, why do you ask? Mami, did you make my braces appointment yet? No, I didn't.
Mom, have you seen that Can everyone just get off my back and do what you're supposed to be doing? - Oh, chill out.
- Jeez.
Mom, why are you so uptight? I'm sorry.
But I'm working my sweet nalguitas off, and you guys should be, too! That's why I'm at the top of my class! I'm just being real with you! CÃ¡lmate, niÃ±a.
[SCOFFS] "Calm down"? Are you the same woman who broke out the chancleta while I was memorizing the states? - 'Cause I'll never be able to forget it.
- You hit Mami with your chancleta? Oh, please, I would never.
It's just a learning tool.
No interruptions.
Let's go dance some more! Okay.
ChassÃ©.
Who can do a chassÃ©? And who can do a beautiful leap like a deer? Who can do that? Who can do a chaÃ®nÃ©? Oh! That is so beautiful! Dance with your hearts.
Dance with your souls.
Thank you for letting me study here.
It's so peaceful.
You don't realize how much noise there is until there is no noise.
[CHUCKLES] I got work, too.
[CLEARS THROAT] See, the key to effective spinning is a great music playlist.
This one I'm working on right now is tiger-themed.
So far I've got "Eye Of The Tiger" and that Katy Perry song where she says, "Eye of the tiger.
" - You wanna hear my playlist? - Shut up! Okay.
[SCOFFS] I guess it's suddenly cool to walk into somebody else's apartment and treat it like it's your own.
[SOBS] [SIGHS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Hey.
What? What's up with the spin stuff? Okay, I decided to take a break from dating.
The point is, I've broken the cycle of addiction with spinning.
Five hours a day, every single day.
I have to do it! Yeah, you don't sound addicted at all.
Get off my back! [CLICKS TONGUE] I'm sorry, I'm just [SIGHS] I'm having so much trouble focusing.
I just can't seem to hold information in my head anymore.
You know what might help you? - Do not say spinning.
- Spinning! Stay with me.
I have found that it actually helps me retain information a lot better.
This is why I wear the helmet.
[CELLO PLAYING] Oh, papito.
If Yo-Yo Ma heard you play, he would quit.
Yeah, he would.
All right! Test is done.
And tonight, I'm shaving my left leg.
What's happening here? Did the school shut down your GSA protest? Worse.
They said yes! They think it would be "a positive influence on the educational community.
Climate change, sexism, racism, there's a lot of bad things happening! Elena, what is going on? Usually when you win, you're insufferable.
You even have that dance you do.
[GRUNTING] You got that I don't know what it is, but right now, I miss it.
Whatever.
There's still plenty of people out there who hate that I'm gay.
Honey, I know that.
But society's changing.
People are more accepting than ever.
I just thought it'd get easier but it still sucks.
I know, mija.
I just I haven't gotten a call, or an e-mail It's been three months.
I just thought he'd be sorry by now, but maybe he never will be.
I had no idea you were feeling this way.
I am sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You know, not to brag but I have some experience being angry with your papi.
You have to trust me.
It doesn't hurt him, it only hurts you.
So you need to celebrate all the good things happening in your life, yeah? Yeah.
So why don't we try this again? You got the GSA.
What? The GSA! With a snack budget and a meeting room.
Come on! Come Yeah! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! I don't know what that is, but I'm glad to see it.
[BOTH LAUGH] Hey, do you guys have an ice pack? I may have overspun.
Oh, my God.
[GROANS] Hey, did you get your test score yet? - It's after 5:00! - [EXCLAIMS] [PENELOPE] They probably posted it.
Schneider, why don't you lay down, huh? Okay? - [GROANS] - Yeah.
- Uh - [SIGHS] You do it.
Come on! What is it? Don't tell me that you did so much better than the rest of the class that they are now cyberbullying you? No, Mami.
I did bad.
I did really bad.
You don't do bad.
" This is all my fault.
You needed to do real studying, and I distracted you with my spinning and beautiful globes.
No, I did study.
[SIGHS] I tried really hard and I still didn't do good.
Do "well.
" Sorry.
It's just one test, Mom.
You'll do better next time.
Mom, maybe you just need to study more.
No, that's not it.
It's me.
I can't do it.
Of course you can! [ALL TALKING] No, Mami, I can't! I obviously can't! I'm sorry.
I let you all down, and I really wanted to do this for all of us.
But I think it's time to admit it, that I tried, and I failed.
And now I think it's time to quit.
But this is this is also my dream.
You know, a great family.
I already have a great job.
When you add school on top of it, it's like I'm trying to do three things great, but I'm just doing them all badly.
So I think this is the right decision, and I think it's time to quit.
Okay.
[INHALES DEEPLY] - I can go back to showering every day.
- [ALL CHUCKLE] I can take you to protest so you can yell at people.
This is gonna be great.
Who knows, maybe after a couple years, when you guys are out of the house, and it's not so crazy, maybe I can tackle school again.
Yeah.
Sure.
Oh, my God, you guys You guys do you know what I'm gonna do tomorrow morning? I'm gonna sleep till 6:30 in the morning! - [LYDIA] Whoa! - [ALL CHUCKLING] Aw Keep it going.
I'll get there.
No.
Fire in the junkyard.
- Get up! - What the Mami! [PANTING] It's 4:30 in the morning.
I know, sweetheart.
Dale! - What's happening? - You'll see, you'll see, ya verÃ¡s.
- Ta-da! - Ah! Okay, this is nice.
What is this? We decided you're staying in school.
No, no.
No, remember, I failed.
I'm a quitter, it's fine.
You didn't fail, Mom, you just can't do it alone.
That's right! You know, you don't have to be a super woman! There can only be one such woman in a family, and that is me.
So we're all going to pitch in and help you make your dream come true.
I'll take out the trash, pack my own lunch And I am going to skip the Queer Women March Against Nukes to help you.
- What's your preferred study method? - Coffee and tears.
You are a disaster! I can fix you.
If this is what you want.
I do.
And I will be here for you, mi amor.
[CHUCKLES] Oh! I see you found your Okay! No more talk! A estudiar! Can you guys keep it down? Schneider, why are you still here? I can't feel my legs.
I might be here for another day or two.
Oh It's the scene from my snow globe.
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [ELENA] This is gonna be good.
Sounds like Alex is home.
No, Mami, that's Elena.
But I hear friends.
" Oh, 'cause peeps are candy chicks used to celebrate pagan fertility, and women are more than just baby-makers? I get it.
Maybe don't say anything.
Anyway, this is the advocacy group I was telling you about.
The Feminist Gamers of Echo Park.
We've been hanging out online and this is our first meeting IRL.
Welcome.
What's everybody's name? I'm Dani.
My pronouns are "she" and "her.
" I'm Margaux.
Pronouns "ze" and "zir.
" I'm Penelope.
My thoughts are "Huh?" and "What?" Seriously, what is happening? Well, because some people are gender non-conforming, they have preferred pronouns.
Ah! I am Lydia.
Pronouns "Ly-dee-a.
" We're going downtown to protest the release of a new video game.
Blood-splosion Six.
And the advertising strongly suggested there would be three.
Okay, just, you know, be careful.
Don't worry.
I'll be watching them.
Why would you be watching Syd? - I meant you.
- My pronoun is "her.
" - I thought she was "her.
" - We're both "her.
" Stop making this confusing.
'Sup? Ay, papito.
You are barking up so many wrong trees.
I love all the activism, but make sure it doesn't affect your homework.
- Because - I need to - build up my transcript.
- Build up your transcript.
- And crush the PSATs! - And crush the PSATs! Wha Yes! That's my girl! Okay, everybody! When we get there, she takes her team to the stairs, ze takes zir team to the parking lot, and they take their team to the corner.
He, she, they, and ze will all meet up at the fair-trade coffee shop - between the two Starbucks.
Start one liter normal saline bolus wide open, prep room two.
Page a trauma team.
Hey! I say all that.
I'm sorry.
Nurse practitioner in training.
It's my first day.
I'm a little nervous.
Don't let it happen again.
Max Ferraro? Oh, my God! Oh! I I can't believe you're here! The last time I saw you was in Kabul, right? Yeah, at the field hospital! The one where they turned the mess hall into a salsa club on Thursday nights.
Yeah, that's right.
The Kabul Cabana! - [CHUCKLES] - Have you always been this tall? You haven't seen me in a while.
Had a growth spurt at 40.
[BOTH LAUGH] - It's great to see you! - Yeah! So, how are ya? How's Victor? Uh, Victor, he, um We're divorced.
[CHUCKLES] He's in Afghanistan doing the contractor thing.
How's Amber? She's in Altadena, doing our contractor.
Anyway, we're divorced.
We should, um, get together after work sometime, catch up.
[CHUCKLES] Uh Look, I'm gonna be real with you because you are cute.
[CHUCKLES] Uh It's not gonna happen, you know.
Between work, my two kids, and school, I don't have any free time.
Until I graduate, this is my social life.
Nurse Alvarez.
We need you to deal with that anorectal abscess.
Saturday night came early! [CHUCKLES] I gotta go drain a butt.
Magnificent! Wow.
So when I get older, will I be easily amazed, too? Hush, papito.
- [CHUCKLES] Leslie has been so helpful! - [CHUCKLES] That's true.
Now Abuelita won't need you to come over and get jars down from the top shelf.
Whoops.
- [LAUGHING] My gosh! - So how did it go? Amazing! [LAUGHS] We delivered a powerful message and we were heard.
[CHUCKLES] Dani was, honestly, inspirational.
So you got them to change the video game? No.
And we will wear them ironically! Yay, us! [LAUGHS] This calls for celebration.
Why don't I cook some food for your friends? Great idea! Do you guys want to stay for dinner? - Sure.
- Oh, you guys have fun, but I gotta go.
So everybody should probably go.
[CHUCKLES] - We can meet up next week.
- Yeah.
Bye! - [DANI] Bye.
- [MARGAUX] Bye.
Now I'm terrified to speak.
Why are you smiling? I think somebody has a crush on "her.
" Dani? No, I don't! I don't even know her! You have a crush on her! [LAUGHS] No, no, no.
When it comes to detecting romance, I am like cousin Aurensio at the beach with his metal detector.
So you found nothing and you're sweating through your shirt? Don't be bashful.
I think it is fantastic to be young and in love and to flirt.
And by the way, I can teach you things because your flirting is de madre.
I wasn't flirting.
But never too young to flirt.
When I came out of my mother's womb, I winked at the doctor! I guess you always had a thing for doctors, huh? Eh, I got over it.
I will teach you to flirt.
If they say something clever, laugh loudly, throw your head back, and reveal your perfect neck.
[LAUGHING] I'm a fan of the specific compliment.
I really like your shirt.
It's a great color on you.
Â¡Gracias, papito! [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] Will you two stop flirting with each other? It's beyond creepy! Oh, welcome home! We are flirting! QuÃ© fun! Ma, when are you not flirting? Are you doing your famous [IMITATES LYDIA LAUGHING] Classic.
A crush? Uh-uh.
No.
I don't need to remind you that while you're in school, there is no time for dating.
Lupe, don't crush her crush.
[SCOFFS] You're the one who taught me this! You and Papi constantly made me focus on school.
And I hated it, too, but it ended up being a good thing.
And now I pass the annoyance on to you.
Elena, I'm sorry, but you can't date.
Why did I wear granny panties today? You can't think of anything else because you want them so much.
Well, too bad! We shut that crush down! Because we don't let anything get in the way of our education.
Even maldito crystal blue eyes! Oh, you are so strict.
And very specific.
I don't care.
School comes first, dating comes never.
Okay, whatever! Ay, Lupita, Elena can't help it if she has feelings.
Besides, flirting can be fun, and it doesn't hurt anyone.
How'd all that butt stuff go? You mean, was I successful in satisfying the requirements for my clinical studies? I was.
Okay.
You, uh, heading home? No, I'm going to the club.
Why are you being mean? I don't know.
[BOTH EXHALE] [WHISPERS] Oh, my God.
Por el amor de Dios.
Yeah, I liked it too.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Oh, my God, I did a bad thing.
But bad, bad.
It was such a huge mistake! Oh, I've seen this before.
[CLEARS THROAT] Sex, drugs, or Cheesecake Factory? I met a guy at work, and I slept with him.
What is that, like a Make-A-Wish thing? No! What? No! But it was wrong! And I'm freaking out! Okay, okay, okay, come here, come here.
Just sit down.
Just walk me through what happened.
Paramedic I knew from way back.
I mean, he's He's a really good guy.
I was thinking more, "We met in the ER.
- He gave me ten ccs of hot" - No, I'm serious, Schneider! I have never I've never done anything like this before.
I have a strict seven-date policy.
Well, this is the second guy you've hooked up with in 20 years.
Maybe it's time to update that policy.
Dating has changed since the 1800s.
Guilt, shame, and regret are things of the past.
Be sex-positive, girl.
I'm dating a mother.
You know her.
Nikki.
Finn's mom? - Yeah! - Ugh.
- Hello, Penelope.
- Hey, hi! Oh, my God! [CHUCKLES] I didn't mean anything.
Oh, please.
My self-esteem is bulletproof.
Oh, yeah, it's great.
I come over, tell him to do stuff to me, he does it, I go home.
You should get one.
Oh, no, no, no.
That is okay.
I think what Nikki was kinda dancing around is that you don't always have to have a relationship with a capital "R.
" Sometimes all you need is what the great poets of the Renaissance called a junk buddy.
Exactly.
Ah, see, I don't want that.
I can't have sex without love.
Oh.
That's so sad.
So, are you gonna ask Dani out? What? No.
It's just complicated, okay? I get it.
You don't have a crush on Dani and you don't want to talk about it.
Okay, I do have a crush! I do, I do, I do! Whoa! Act like you've been there.
Be a pretty sweet pool.
I just I assumed that coming out was going to be the difficult part, but now that I like someone, I just I don't know if Dani's gay.
What if she's not? I don't want to be the gay girl that asks out a straight girl.
That's such a trope.
Huh.
Gay dating sounds tricky.
I just toss out a couple of "sups," and see who responds.
Being a straight dude is the best.
What if she runs away or something? So instead, you are running away! Abuelita! Can't a girl have a moment of privacy? I live behind a curtain.
When are you going to understand this? Elena, love must be bold.
Well, I'm not sure I should be bold.
I've been told, by more than a few people, that I'm "a lot.
" Who? Mostly you.
It's always been easy for you guys.
What if no one ever likes me? Ah.
Well, it has not always been easy for me.
And he looked so majestic on that tractor, with a cigar dangling from his lips.
And I, looking ravishing with a cigar dangling from my lips.
And one day I decided to let him know of my feelings.
And he laughed and he drove away.
That's terrible.
Oh, I was devastated.
I salted the soil with my tears and a beautiful rose grew there.
- Really? - It's a metaphor.
And there is where I met Berto.
So you're saying you never would have met Abuelito if you hadn't put yourself out there and been rejected by Flavio? Exactly! Because in love, you have to make yourself vulnerable.
But it's just really hard.
No.
No, mira, this is what you do.
You offer Dani a cookie.
And if she doesn't want it, then it'll be like she's rejecting the cookie, and not you.
And for God's sake, who wants to be with somebody who doesn't even want a cookie? Yeah.
Just staring awkwardly and smelling her hair as she walks by.
You could do better.
[BREATHES DEEPLY] Thanks, Abuelita.
That was really nice of you to tell her that story, Abuelita.
Mentiras.
That was my sister Maruchi's story, and you know what? Frankly, I'm a little insulted that you both believe that happened to me.
- Hey! - Hey.
Hi.
- [CHUCKLES] - Can I buy you dinner? Sun Chips? Funyuns? A single $6 Aspirin? God, they gouge you here.
No, thanks.
[CHUCKLES] Then how about I take you out on a real date? Somewhere classy, where they make you pay for water.
Listen, Max.
What happened last night, that's not me.
I mean, it was me.
I don't have, like, a really sexy twin.
[CHUCKLES] But, um I don't normally do that.
So am I! That was a first for me.
I'm actually pretty old-fashioned.
[SCOFFS] Yeah, right! Look at you.
You're telling me you never jumped into bed with some cute little car crash victim? Traffic accidents aren't the hook-up spots you think they are.
Actually, when Amber and I broke up, it hit me like a ton of bricks.
But, you know, after that, I kind of threw myself into work.
Look, last night was great.
Even though we rushed into it I've had a crush on you for like 15 years.
And I want more than a junk buddy.
"Junk buddy"? Yeah, it's a thing.
Or maybe it's not a thing.
I gotta be honest, I've got some real idiots giving me advice.
It sounds like it.
Oh.
All right.
We've got a problem.
So what do we do? [BOTH EXHALE] I need a nap.
Oh, damn, that was good.
We ate an entire pizza in 17 minutes.
And we managed to tell two embarrassing stories from high school.
I'm not sure going to all four senior proms counts as embarrassing.
- But this was fun.
- [LAUGHS] - [SIGHS] - Hey, come on, come on.
Is this crazy? No! I mean, it's not ideal, but it's better than sitting in the back of an ambulance, eating chili.
Well, it's an ambulance, so I usually have company.
I guess that's still sad.
[PENELOPE SIGHS] So you'd really be okay with just 45 minutes a week? With you? I will take what I can get.
Okay, but we have to keep this a secret 'cause there's no way I can explain to my mom and kids what this is.
I'm gonna tell all my friends 'cause they'll get it.
That's cool with me.
[BOTH LAUGHING] - [MAX SIGHS] - Mmm.
Okay.
So what I'm hearing is we got five minutes.
Lucky for you, I can do a lot in five minutes.
I love these unisex shirts.
Could use more blood though.
[SNIFFS AND SIGHS] Are you looking to get your courage up? Do you want a little rum? No! I don't even want to talk to her until I know for sure that she's gay.
Mmm.
Wait, what are you doing? Excuse me, "she.
" What color lipstick are you wearing? Oh, I don't wear lipstick.
[CELL PHONE BUZZES] Ooh, my girlfriend's out front.
She hates when I make her wait.
And she just bought me a cookie! I love cookies! [CHUCKLES] She has a girlfriend.
She's so lucky.
Hey, uh, do you want to split that cookie? Huh? Wait.
Oh Oh, never mind.
Uh, I thought Sorry.
- Sorry, sorry.
- That's great.
- [BOTH CHUCKLE] Cookie? Uh Yeah.
She is terrible at this.
Thank goodness she has us.
- Mami, don't get mad - What is it? What did you do? I told you not to get mad! Which is the quickest way to make me mad! Okay, let me start again! So I've been talking to Syd Syd? I thought you liked Dani.
Dani is yesterday's news.
Keep up! Anyway, I started talking to Syd and I found out we have so much in common.
And I know you're not crazy about me dating, but I was just wondering if I could get ice cream with them.
But I have seven more reasons why you should let me do this.
Take yes for an answer.
Being a good student is obviously important, but it's not the only thing.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! Yeah.
Of course! It's important to make a little time for romance.
Otherwise, what are we doing? Mm-hmm.
- [SIREN WAILING] - [INHALES DEEPLY AND SIGHS] What? Now you like the sounds of sirens? Just the thought of an ambulance rushing towards a body that needs attention.
My clinical hours got rescheduled, and I'm free.
Squirrel attack? How many people could it have bitten? That many? Mmm.
Oh, no.
No, I just have classes and kid stuff for the rest of the week, but I really wanted to see you because I have an emergency in my - Hey, Mom.
- [STAMMERS] Thank you, Dr.
Berkowitz.
Good work phone call.
Thanks.
And I need a margarita, but it's 7:00 in the morning.
Mom, please.
I'm going to a movie.
Okay, papito.
Here.
Ten dollars.
Oh, maybe I wasn't clear.
I'm actually going to a movie in this century.
50.
And I expect change.
No, I feel your pain.
I never had enough money to go to the movies with friends.
Or enough friends to go to the movies with friends.
Oh, I know, why don't you pluck your one mustache hair, and you can get the kid price? Why don't you pluck your 20 mustache hairs? Joke's on you, because each one of these hairs is a blow to the patriarchy.
Oh, you win.
Come on, Mom.
No, that's your abuelita.
Look, my, uh, clinical hours got all squirrelly.
So I'm gonna take you to the movies and show you how to have fun on a budget.
What? No.
It'll be great.
- It'll be like a date with your mom.
- No! No, no, no.
- Stop.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
[CHUCKLES] Ay.
Â¡Ay, ay, ay, ay! Â¡Ay! Oh [GROANING] Well, don't make such a big deal of it.
I'm fine.
What happened? She tripped on the sidewalk in front of the building and hurt her arm.
[GRUNTS] I had to break my fall.
- Abuelita, how did you trip? - That stupid sidewalk was broken.
The roots of the tree pushed it up.
[GROANS] Man, Mother Nature is turning on us.
And after we've treated her so well.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Okay, I have figured out what to do about that tree.
Form a Million Abuelita March.
That adds up to, like, seven million hard candies.
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.
This is not my usual machete arm.
[LAUGHS] - Ah [EXCLAIMS] - Okay.
Let's just put this back in the machete cozy? Hey, come on.
I just want to chop off the roots of the tree.
There's something less murder-y that might help.
Uh, Proposition U.
You want to proposition me? No.
It would pay for infrastructure repairs, including sidewalks.
And there may even be enough money to replace the plastic recycling bins in Echo Park with new recycling bins made out of recycled recycling bins.
That is great.
About the sidewalks getting fixed, not your trash talk.
Okay.
The election is this Tuesday, so make sure you vote "yes" on Prop U.
I would love to, but I don't vote.
[CHUCKLES] What do you mean you don't vote? I mean that on the election day, instead of voting, I don't vote.
I didn't vote for him! Good for you.
Oh, you will never believe what we just discovered.
Mami, how many times have I told you to give that machete to the Goodwill? Yeah, I don't think a machete is really on brand for them.
No.
We found out Abuelita doesn't vote.
Oh, that? Yeah, I know.
What? How could you let this happen? Voting is the single most important thing we can do as Americans.
Don't yell at me, I know.
I vote in other ways! I take a lot of online quizzes.
Turns out I'm a Hufflepuff.
See, the great thing about having a green card is you get to live here without having to do all the stuff Americans have to, like vote or serve jury duty or become obese.
Okay, but at least you vote in Canadian elections.
Mmm No.
Even in Canada, nothing ever changes.
Clean air, sensible gun control, free health care.
The system's rigged.
But you're always talking about how this country saved you from a communist dictatorship and how democracy is a gift.
That's true.
God bless the USA.
These colores don't run.
So why don't you vote? It doesn't do anything.
[GRUNTS] Â¡Ay! I mean, I can't wait to turn 18 so that I can vote, and you're wasting yours? She's right, Mami.
This isn't one of those big elections? They're all big elections! They're all big elections, Mami! I mean, sure, some issues are more important than others, but I can think of a thousand reasons Â¡Ay, ay, ay! Okay! You win.
And if you stop talking, I win.
Yes.
I thought this was a democracy.
But this is some kind of dictatorship where people are forced to vote! Ooh, okay.
Let's find three seats.
One for me, one for you, one for the bag of money we're gonna save.
Oh, God.
Those kids are from school.
- You wanna sit with them? - No, no, no, let's stay here.
First I have no money, now I have no dignity.
Maybe, but what you do have is What? Where'd these come from? My pockets.
Is that why you're wearing cargo pants? First of all, they were very stylish in the '90s.
Second, it is the key to sneaking food past any by-the-book ushers who might narc on you.
Ba-blam! Licorice.
Where'd you get these? The 99-Cent Store? [SCOFFS] The 98-Cent Store.
Yeah, your mami ain't no chump.
See, we may not be spending a lot of money, but it's lit, right? 5-0! Dust it off.
Ugh.
Come on.
I mean, otherwise you'll just be another uninformed voter.
Yeah.
They look so happy.
Yeah.
And who wants to live like that? [CHUCKLES] Anyway, there's a lot of really serious stuff on this ballot.
Um, let's start with Prop T, "Stand Behind Teachers.
I will vote "yes" on T.
Oh, good job, Abuelita.
- You just got them all fired.
- [GASPS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SIGHS] A lot of these ballot measures are intentionally misleading.
So, Prop T would replace union teachers with non-union teachers who make half as much.
"Stand Behind Teachers"? More like, "Stand behind them so we can kick them out the door," am I right? Are we done now? No, we're just getting started! There's the school board race, the controller race [GASPS] and a very exciting sewer tax initiative.
Oh.
Did you hear the knock? I think there's somebody at the door.
But aren't we breaking the law or something? I don't want to end up in jail.
If the other prisoners ask me what I'm in for and I say "gummy bears," I don't see that ending well.
There is no law against outside food.
There's a rule, but that's totally different.
- It's okay to break the rules? - Absolutely not.
Unless the rule's nuts.
Speaking of nuts Goobers.
They're so warm.
You know how much a box of Goobers costs to make? A penny.
- You really know that or - A penny! I scored these at a gas station on Pico.
Mislabeled at 49 cents! I bought every box.
We're gonna be serving Goobers at your wedding.
I'm good with that.
- You have any soda in your pants? - No.
[SMACKS LIPS] Aw.
Ba-blam! No, no, no.
- [EXPLOSION] - [CANS HISSING] Come on, people, let's go! We gotta get there before the polls close! They close in 11 hours.
I'm excited, okay? I mean, Abuelita's never voted before.
I can't wait for my first time.
And I hope I do it right.
I was really hoping my first time would be with Hillary, but I can picture myself doing it with Elizabeth Warren.
You and me both, sister.
Hey, Mom, if you have time tonight, maybe we can go see another movie? You want to hang out with me again? The movie's R-rated, so I kind of need you.
[CHUCKLES] - But we had fun, right? - Yes, we did.
Oh, well, maybe next time.
Come on, Abuelita.
I was so looking forward to taking you to vote.
I know, and I am so disappointed to miss it.
Ah! You don't have to.
I have a wheelchair up in my apartment.
I was Stephen Hawking for Halloween.
[IMITATING STEPHEN HAWKING] People were offended.
Great news! USA! USA! US [LOCK RATTLING] What the hell is happening? Why is she locking us out? - Schneider, I need your key.
- Sure.
Here.
Thank you.
I've been trying to get this away from you for two years.
Nice try.
These are all your apartment.
- Mami! - Abuelita! - Lydia? - Abuelita! - She's probably in the kitchen.
Make that the reason.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Okay.
[SIGHS AND CLEARS THROAT] I don't vote because I am not a citizen.
What? Yes, you are.
You and Papi had your citizenship interviews - while I was deployed in Afghanistan.
- No.
We were supposed to, but we never did.
We ended up spending the whole afternoon in the park together, bird-watching.
Which is ironic, because the birds were watching us.
Stop trying to change the subject.
Especially to that subject.
How did you never become a citizen? I was busy, you know! I was working, raising a family, helping my family to raise their family! Oh, you're welcome.
But anyway, it doesn't matter because I have a green card.
I get social security, I pay taxes.
Whoa.
You have to pay taxes with a green card? [GROANS LOUDLY] I am a permanent resident.
[SIGHS] This actually makes me so much happier, Abuelita.
I understand.
It's not that you don't want to vote.
You can't.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Then this is great! Because green card holders can become citizens easily.
You just have to take tests.
No, thank you! She is so infuriating! I know, but right now she's embarrassed, and you being all over her is not the answer.
Let her calm down.
I'm gonna go vote in this very important election, and we're gonna talk later.
Okay? - Okay? - Yeah.
Whoo! Okay, it's fine.
I'm all good, guys! I texted my accountant, and he said 'cause I'm in the highest income bracket, I don't have to pay taxes.
[LAUGHS] USA! USA! USA! USA! [WHISPERS] Do I look suspicious? No.
You look very fashionable for the '90s.
I can't believe she never told us she wasn't a citizen.
[SIGHS] Some people just carry around secrets.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [PLANES HOVERING] - [PLANES ROAR] - [CANS HISSING] Perfect.
Now let's break out those hot dogs while they're still warm.
Although, I could always warm 'em up.
You're gonna love this.
I improved on what you taught me.
They'll stay warm.
- [FOIL CRINKLING] - No, don't! That's too loud.
[EXCLAIMS] - It smells like bacon! - I brought bacon.
No! The usher's coming! Get rid of that evidence! Give it.
- Excuse me - Shh.
Movie.
Ma'am, we don't allow food that was not purchased at our concession stand.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Oh, shoot.
[CHUCKLES] I'm gonna have to confiscate that food, ma'am.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, ma'am.
- [WOMAN SHUSHING] - Seriously? [USHER SHUSHING] Let me tell you something.
I get that you're trying to do your job.
But come on.
I'm a mom out with my kid.
[WHISPERS] I don't know her.
And yeah.
Yeah, we broke your rules.
- Security.
- No! So yeah, I will leave! I'm gonna leave.
- But I will leave with my principles! - [PEOPLE SHUSHING] And a fully-loaded baked potato! Thank you so much for dealing with that Alex! Come on! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Perfecto.
And your accent is hysterical.
Abuelita, can we talk? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Okay.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] that was going to get me out of it.
Abuelita, you need to become a citizen.
This is a big deal! Everything's a big deal to you! If I light a candle, I am killing the air.
This is not a joke.
We live in very anti-immigrant times! Baby, it's not that serious.
Yes, it is.
Carmen's parents weren't citizens.
Yeah, but nothing like that's gonna happen to Abuelita.
She's not gonna get deported.
She could be.
They're deporting Cubans now, too.
Things keep changing.
I mean, it's way worse for some other groups, but still.
Carmen lost her parents.
I lost my best friend.
[STAMMERS] And I just don't want to lose you.
[SIGHS] What if one day they decide to send all non-citizens back to where they came from? No! I can't go back to Canada! It's just so cold! So become an American citizen.
Both of you.
Elena's right, Mami.
[MIMICKING LYDIA] I know you do.
So what is the problem? When Berto and I learned that in order to be sworn in as Americans, we would have to renounce our Cuban citizenship, we could not bring ourselves to do it.
- Cuba is home.
Home-home.
- [SIGHS] But you've been here for almost 60 years, Mami.
This is your home now.
I know you miss Cuba.
But you know there's no going back, right? Even now that Castro's dead, nothing has really changed.
My papi made sure that I had the deed to our house.
And I still have it.
Just in case we ever go back there.
Mami I know.
It's silly.
But becoming an American citizen would be like giving up.
[SNIFFLES] I just wish you could have seen it like it was.
[SIGHS DEEPLY] I'm sorry.
That will never change.
That's what we are.
Me, Elena, Alex.
You brought Cuba here and you gave it to us.
It's true.
Whenever someone asks me what I am, I always say I'm Cuban.
I don't even think about it.
Yeah.
So please, Abuelita.
I hear what you are saying.
And I love you.
And I will think about it.
[SIGHS] Well, I've made my decision.
I'm gonna become a citizen.
Now, the English test should be a breeze, but as far as the civics test goes, I'd better put on my thinkin' toque, stock up on Timmies and study like a real keener, eh? I don't mind people moving here.
I just wish they'd learn the language.
And I'm so sorry I put you through all that.
And I didn't have to go back to take all those ketchup packets, but what, are we gonna buy Heinz at the store like the king of England? It's okay.
You taught me something important.
Good.
I need to get a job and work hard so I can buy real snacks and avoid looking like a total nutjob.
That's exactly the point I was trying to teach you.
Mom, have you seen Abuelita? Prop U passed and I want to tell her the good news.
I don't know where she is.
[LYDIA] Aw.
QuÃ© fun.
[CHUCKLES] My granddaughter is dating a box.
Actually, I'm the TARDIS.
Oh! "TARDIS.
" Elena said I must never use that word anymore.
Uh, it's from Doctor Who, Abuelita.
The TARDIS is a time-traveling police box.
Next to being able to rap in Klingon.
Ay, pobrecita, you are even more of a nerd than Elena.
Ah.
You guys look great.
And, Alex [CHUCKLES] You look so handsome.
It's my first Bar Mitzvah.
I don't want to look like a schlemiel.
Dr.
I'm plotzing with nachas.
Ay, papito, I can't believe it's your first sleepover.
Yeah.
Only eight short years after all my friends had their first sleepover.
Hey! Be thankful that Abuelita and I are being so cool about it.
I vetted the mom.
She was in the Israeli army, super strict.
No guns in the home.
She gets it.
Okay, I color-coded the panel schedule so we can hit as many as we can before the Dungeons & Dragons session.
Roll a D20, with a plus-five to fun! Blink twice if you need help.
You're not gonna have time to talk to each other.
This is our first date, okay? I really like Syd.
I want them to like me back, so I packed our day full of stuff so I have no time to be awkward.
That's what's so brilliant about this schedule.
We never have to talk.
I bet you Doctor Who even talks to his patients.
He's not that kind of doctor.
He is a Time Lord, everybody knows this.
What's your costume? The Wicked Witch of the East Side? Don't make jokes about witchcraft.
It's like SanterÃ­a.
I don't believe in it but I respect it.
We're catching Pagliacci at the San Diego Opera House.
For some reason, I've always empathized with sad clowns.
I'm gonna miss you guys, but you gotta beat the traffic, I gotta hit the books.
Ah, I'm gonna pull an all-nighter, make those little flashcards.
I'm gonna do some highlighting.
All right, I'm gonna miss you guys so much! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Okay.
Yes.
You look good, girl.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hid in the hallway until your family left, like a secret agent.
Then I did a shoulder roll.
Uh, you don't want to meet those people.
How about for now, you just say hi to the girls? I thought you had a son and a Oh.
- [BOTH LAUGH] - [PENELOPE] Mmm.
Wait, hold on.
- Okay, let's go.
- [LAUGHING] [BOTH MOANING] [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTING] No.
That's my mom's room.
There's crosses, pictures of the Pope, and my dad's ghost's in there.
Otherwise known as Echo Park in July.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] We're in pursuit of a dangerous suspect.
He is armed.
Everyone, go back inside, and do not leave your building.
Think your family made it out? - [LYDIA GRUNTS] - [PENELOPE GASPS] Lupe! There is a murderer running loose.
Get in there.
Okay, coming! [PANTING] Coming! Yeah.
Okay! Oh, you guys are back.
They're not letting us leave.
- Why do you look so nice? - Oh, this? This is what I wear when you aren't here.
You just never see it.
I have never been more proud of you.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] For your safety, please remain inside until further notice.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] We're going to miss the masquerade and the dance party.
And the Firefly panel, the Zombie Run, the Buffy sing-a-long, and the super-gay Supergirl meet up.
But this lockdown is awesome.
Exterminate.
" Actually, this seems like a pretty serious situation.
But it's okay.
We'll just hang out and talk.
[CHUCKLES] Talk? Yeah.
Wait.
Keep the costumes on, and go up to Schneider's.
He's a man-child who lives off his parents, and likes dressing up in weird outfits.
- [LYDIA SIGHS] - I'm sorry we're going to miss the opera.
Let me see if I can get a refund on our tickets.
Hey, hey! Why are you going in here? Because it's where you make me live like a dog without a door.
Actually, Mami, why don't you make everyone something to eat? There are over three people, and no one is cooking.
What kind of Cuban are you? That's true.
Mala cubana.
Hey, kids, why don't you go to your rooms and wait until dinner? - Cool.
- [CHUCKLES] You want us to be alone in my room? Me and my date? Leave the door open.
- No, ew.
- Come on.
[LYDIA SCREAMS] [PENELOPE YELLING AND PANTING] My succulent died! Oh [KNOCK AT DOOR] - Ay, who is that? - [STAMMERS] It's probably one of those shirtless door-to-door salesmen.
[PENELOPE AND DR.
BERKOWITZ SCREAM] Hey, guys.
Why are you wearing a gas mask? Why aren't you? With all that's going on out there? Oh, man.
Now, look, I prepared us a survival kit.
It's a little bare-bones.
- We were safe when you weren't here.
- Okay.
But can I stay? I'm all alone up there.
Do you have any idea how scary it is being a wealthy white man in a lavish apartment? [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] I'm a target! Of course you can stay, Schneider.
Why should this night be different from any other night? - [SCHNEIDER SIGHING] - [SPEAKING HEBREW] Nailed it.
[WHISPERS] Schneider, come here.
Max is here somewhere.
Unless he's Houdini.
- [EXHALES SHARPLY] Shag City got shut down by the po-po.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been following him on Instagram.
Seems like a super cool dude.
Great abs.
[SIGHS] I know, right? [CHUCKLES] But it's way too soon.
Nobody is meeting him, especially not my mom.
One look at him, bam, she's sewing me in a wedding dress, and you'll be my maid of honor.
He hasn't seen me with zit cream on my face, and inhaling a bag of Cheetos like it's nothing.
And I don't know if I want him to.
I just wanna keep climbing him like a beanstalk, and never reach the top.
That's it.
I don't even wanna know his middle name.
Vernon.
Can I have my shirt? He looks shorter than I thought.
So, I guess you're stuck with me.
- Yeah, it's stupid.
- It's my favorite book.
- Stupid how much I love it.
You okay, there? Yeah.
I'm just super hungry.
For food.
Uh, how about we be normal and get snacks? - Elena, can you help me? - Shurbly-burbly.
- What is up with you? - Nothing.
You're good at talking.
People say you're charming.
People are right.
I'll work some magic.
Just because I'm missing the Bar Mitzvah doesn't mean I can't be a mensch.
Okay.
[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] Here, quick, Schneider, help me.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[BOTH GRUNTING] - Just go, just go.
- Go, go, go.
Yes, go.
All right.
Okay.
- [LYDIA SCREAMS] - [PENELOPE GASPS] Is that the killer? Leslie, stay behind me.
Wait.
No.
Thank you? Who are you? [STUTTERS] This? Him? [STAMMERS] Go ahead and tell them who he is.
This is Max, my sponsor.
From Alcoholics Anonymous.
So, forget I just said his name.
So great to meet you, Max.
Why don't you two head over to Schneider's apartment? - Yes! - Sounds great, Penelope.
It is Penelope? - Yeah, good guess.
Bye.
Ridiculous.
We are in lockdown.
You must stay for dinner.
Okay, Double-A Alex Alvarez and Syd Vicious coming at you from hashtag, lockdown.
- See anything? - [HELICOPTER HOVERING] I see a fire escape, easy access for zombies.
You guys are my witnesses.
Alex, if I get bitten by a zombie, promise me right now that you will take me out.
Do not let me turn.
I'm out.
Oh, Alex, Alex, wait! Your brother's really cool.
He peed his pants once.
Recently? When he was a kid, but I thought you should know.
Dinner! Yay! Food! A group activity.
Let's do this! [MUSIC PLAYING OVER PHONE SPEAKER] Dang! Bubbe is dancing the Hora with Cousin Irving.
You guys are Jewish? [CHUCKLES] No Kids, don't be alarmed by this stranger.
This is Schneider's sponsor, Max.
Hey.
Doesn't she make beautiful children? Mm-hmm.
So, tell me, Max, does she make you want to, uh, fight a duel in her honor? I would kill a thousand men for the pleasure of her smile.
I like you, Max.
Well, I feel very welcome.
Although this is not what I had planned for the evening.
Well, I'm sure you can make it up by doing what you had planned two times on another night.
[CHUCKLES] Mmm.
Did you help cook this, Doc? As a matter of fact, I did.
Your mom and I, we work well together.
We're like two peas in a pod.
Yes, it was fun.
It was like cooking with one of my sisters.
Just the comparison I was hoping for.
I wish I could cook, but, uh Oh, no, you are too busy being a real man.
Oh, you would've been perfect for a younger me.
Actually, Lydia, I am seeing someone, but she's really hard to read.
I don't know if she's serious about me.
She says she just wants to climb me like a beanstalk.
Drop that loser.
Yeah, man, that is insane! Who wouldn't want all this? Those sick tris and strong core, it's like looking in the mirror.
Yes.
Max, you deserve someone with beauty and brains, and shares the same passion you have to help people, like a nurse.
Remind me, honey, what is it you do every day? Price one-way flights back to Cuba.
Someone like my Berto.
Someone who can protect you, who can kill spiders for you, who can make passionate love to you to celebrate the death of a spider.
[ELENA SIGHS] Abuelita, come on.
You're putting things in such absolute binary gender terms.
It's reductive and it perpetuates toxic myths about masculinity.
Yeah, stop perpetrating and stuff.
You look cute on that high horse.
Uh, okay.
Thanks so much for dinner but I'm not really that hungry, so I'm gonna chill till the lockdown's over.
They are walking away from my meal? This is your fault.
[HELICOPTER HOVERING] What are you doing out here? Pretty clear you didn't want me in the apartment, so [ELENA SIGHS] [GRUNTS AND SIGHS] - I'm sorry, I just - It's cool.
Uh, message received.
What message? What did you receive? That you aren't into me.
It's okay.
I'm cool with being friends.
I don't want to be your friend.
No, look, it's the opposite.
I like you so much! Like, so, so much.
Yeah? You have a really weird way of showing it.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing and I don't wanna mess this up.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] Please go back inside! Kissing teenagers, please go back inside! In a minute! - Don't worry.
- [CHUCKLES] I'll protect you.
No, I'll protect you.
[OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] Remain inside.
We have an armed suspect still in the area.
Wow, they still haven't caught him.
Don't worry.
We have a man to protect us.
It's like we're invisible.
I'm glad you're here, too, dude.
That guy breaks in, you could take him.
The police will take care of it.
And no one is fighting with anyone.
Your papi would! He once fought a waiter for stealing a look at me in the reflection of a spoon.
That's different.
Maybe a million years ago in Havana, you could get away with that stuff.
That was ten years ago in an IHOP.
Fighting is not the only option.
Whatever happened to running away? It's a Berkowitz family tradition.
Aeneas ran away from Troy and founded Rome.
The Pilgrims fled England, and all they did was start a little country called America.
Shaggy and Scooby always run away from the bad guys.
But then, they solve the damn crime! The only reason why you know about a dead hero is because a live coward was there to tell his story! In this case, I think you're right because that guy out there has a gun.
And that is why I always felt safer knowing that your papi had a gun.
Whoa.
Really? Wait, are you saying there was a gun in the house while I was growing up? Oh, well before that.
It was a wedding gift from the Fajardos.
Guns aren't safe.
That's why we don't have one in this house.
Okay.
Mami.
Why did you say "okay" like that? Where is it? Don't know what you're talking about.
There is a little something in my nightstand.
It's not very big and it certainly will never replace your father, but it does the job.
Is it weird that I hope it's a gun? Dang! Abuelita's packing heat! Mami.
Your papi had it to protect me.
And now, I have it to protect us.
I can't believe this.
For the last decade, I've been the annoying parent that asks other parents do they own a gun.
Well, you didn't ask me.
I don't understand why you are so horrified.
Let me tell you something.
In Cuba, I saw the government turn against its own people.
Who knows what terrible thing could happen? You can justify this any way you want, but it doesn't matter.
More bad things happen because you own a gun, not because you don't.
- That is why I hid it away.
- But that's what everybody says, Ma.
"I locked it up.
I'm careful.
I know how to use it.
" Everybody thinks they're the exception.
And things that aren't accidents.
We have teenagers in this house.
We have a gay teenager in this house.
We have a veteran with PTS.
This is the last house that should have a gun.
I didn't think of it that way, Lupita.
I am sorry.
[SIGHS] It's fine.
- We have a gun! - No, Mami, no! No, no! No.
[SIGHS] The police station.
Tomorrow.
Okay.
We're getting rid of the gun.
Can you put this at your place until tomorrow morning? I'll put it in my panic room.
- Why didn't you go there? - I panicked.
[PENELOPE SIGHS] Heck of a night to meet your family.
You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
Although, someone did grab my butt tonight.
It was either your mom or Schneider.
[SIGHS] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] Attention, the suspect has been apprehended.
You may come out of your homes.
The lockdown is over.
Well, I did it.
I got us through this.
So, should I just get your number from Penelope or Oh, we're really doing this? All right.
Syd, I'll give you a ride home.
Uh, do you mind if we listen to Pagliacci in the car? I must warn you, I weep from start to finish.
That's cool.
Nothing can make me sad right now.
[ELENA CHUCKLES] I will walk you out to make sure you are safe.
I still have these guns.
You know, Lydia I bet ya I could nurse this cactus back to life.
Oh.
Oh, and goodbye, Max.
And I hope that idiota that you are dating realizes what she has.
Thank you, Lydia.
Me, too.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Well, I don't know, Max.
I'm sure that girl's more into you than you think she is.
Maybe invite her over for dinner Saturday night for Thai food, 7:45, and wear those boxer briefs you know she likes? And if you wanna talk, I'm sure she'd be down for it.
Okay.
[CHUCKLES] I was gonna tell you.
I really was You're gonna get rid of it? What? Your gun.
Under the floorboard in your bedroom.
In the safe.
How do you know about that? I thought maybe it was Christmas presents.
I figured out the combination, I'm sorry.
- Did you touch it? - No, I only looked at it.
I was trained how to use it.
Not everybody is.
When your papi left, I didn't wanna find ourselves in a position where we needed one and didn't have it.
You always say that's what everyone says.
But I'm different.
I know how [SIGHS] I'll get rid of it.
Okay.
Good.
Thanks, papito.
 I am crushing it.
I've never played so well.
I am burying you.
You realize you're the top half of the screen? No! Ah! I'm glad you're here, Schneider.
Finally.
I knew I'd hear those words one day.
The lights in the laundry room are out still.
A year later, I gotta change it again.
I mean, what are we doing here? That's mine.
Anyway, I'll fix the lights.
I gotta call my guy, Butch.
So, do that.
Don't micromanage me! What you need to do is to study with me for our citizenship tests.
Are you going to sit on that couch, eating junk food, watching TV all day? Or are you going to be an American? Please.
I'm very patriotic.
Check me out! Oh Sweet kicks, papito.
Abuelita, take a picture for my Insta.
Gonna stare this way so it doesn't look like I know you're doing it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- [PHONE CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] What's going on south of your ankles, buddy? Aren't those the expensive sneakers I said you couldn't have? They were a gift from an admirer.
Mami I can spend my money how I want to.
How about contributing to the rent? I'm a senior! I'm on a fixed income! Mami, I'm trying to teach Alex the value of a dollar.
Ah, what's the point? I get some money, I spend some money.
I mean, what are we doing here? Preach.
Alex, those shoes stay in your closet until you find a way to pay Abuelita back.
Okay.
Fine.
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh [DEEP INHALE] Your debt is forgiven.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] Stop pampering him! Scott and Lori are on vacation.
Dr.
Yeah, I'm okay with that.
- You start tomorrow.
- [SIGHS] You're so unfair! Alex seems very upset.
I'm gonna buy him something.
[LAUGHS] What are you laughing at, freeloader? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I told you three times already you need to get a summer job.
Yeah, I know.
And that is why I got one.
You did? Just hear me out.
[LAUGHS] Oh, my God.
You had me there for a second.
You did.
No, no, no, no.
It's a real thing.
It's like what they say, "Do what you love, and the money will follow.
" Ay, baby.
That's for rich white ladies who want to make jewelry.
Hey, can I be your unpaid intern? - What are your qualifications? - This is all my stuff.
- You're hired! - Yes! Elena, you need to get a real job.
One where you sweat, get blisters, wear an ill-fitting polyester uniform.
Those things don't breathe! [LYDIA] Yeah.
Listen, when I was your age, I had three jobs.
Courier, seamstress and I sold Avon door-to-door.
[PENELOPE] Thank you.
When I was your age, I was scooping ice cream.
Almost died.
Get a job.
All right.
Mom, look.
I have a plan.
If I get 1,000 subscribers, I'll make more than I would doing any minimum wage job.
Just give me a chance.
Okay.
Come on.
We better get back to work.
We're all going to hell.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Thanks, Doc.
This is gonna be great for him and for me.
I loved the summer I worked with my papi.
On the drive home, we'd have these long talks, and they were the closest times we ever had.
When I go out with my daughters, they make me follow in a separate cab.
Here's my urine.
Okay, sir.
Penelope, thanks again for squeezing me in on short notice.
Money's tight and it was great not to miss a day of work.
Ugh.
I hear ya.
Oh! This is right out of the oven.
[LAUGHS] So, we talked about your protein levels.
If every nurse were more like you, people wouldn't hate going to the doctor.
You're just saying that so I give you a lollipop.
- And here you go.
- [CHUCKLES] Ha! You hear that, papito? I got followers in real life.
[LAUGHS] Papito? Come on! You are missing all the action.
That guy just said I am the BeyoncÃ© of nurses.
Okay, but I made a really good playlist.
It's all songs with "boy" in the title.
When we're at work, we work.
This is not a dance party.
[SINGING IN SPANISH] [LAUGHS] What are you doing here? Well, you left so quickly this morning that I didn't have a chance to spritz papito with violetas.
No, no, Mami.
This is a doctor's office.
You cannot be spraying that.
Ah, damn it.
Hit me.
Hi, Lydia.
Oh! Hi, Leslie.
I forgot you work here.
[CHUCKLES] Don't mind me.
I just brought papito a working man's lunch.
So, we got a roast beef sandwich, a ham sandwich, a turkey sandwich, half of a rotisserie chicken, the other half of the rotisserie chicken and a whoopie pie.
[CHUCKLES] - What'd you bring me? - Here is yogurt and some rouge.
SiÃ©ntate.
You're not gonna start with the magic tricks, are you? No, practicing medicine.
I've been a little bit on edge about our "relationship.
" - Why'd you put that in quotes? - She asked me to.
I get it.
I was hoping Alex could see me do my thang, too.
But so far it's just been cold cuts and hot pee.
No, no, I get it.
If someone would just drop dead and I could revive them in front of her, really give her a show! Papito, there is mustard on your chin.
Come on, it was your first day on the job.
What was the most interesting thing that happened? I saw a folder for a guy named David Davids.
That was kind of weird.
What? That's hilarious! [LAUGHS] Actually, Mr.
Davids passed away.
We should probably shred that file.
Anything else you took away from today? Yeah.
It must be hard to be a nurse.
It's like you're an accountant who also has to look at boogers.
I don't know how you do this every day.
Yeah, you can put the headphones back on.
This is Blanquita16, and we are about to get started playing in VR mode.
So as you can see, the graphics are amazing.
That 4K is really working its magic.
Schneider the intern, checking in.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Stop it! I'm trying.
How are women not distracted all day? I cannot believe you two.
Talking to peoples who aren't even there.
[SCOFFS] Can you believe this, Berto? Anyway We're about to battle, but first, let's check out those lifelike reflections on the floor.
[BOTH] Oh [BOTH EXCLAIMING] But I'm a lady! - What the hell is going on? - I'm working, Mom! Penelope, tell my third stepmother I loved her! Not the second one, though.
She was kind of a jerk.
Say goodbye to your whole stepfamily, 'cause you're [EXCLAIMS] finished! Okay, guys, subscribe to my channel.
This is Blanquita16 signing off.
This is obviously work.
It's like watching a business class at Harvard.
It's going great.
I'm up to over 100 subscribers.
Yeah, Elena is legit.
She's gonna be a mogul, have an entourage, probably a jet.
Mogul, entourage, jet? Those are my things! Elena, give papito back his things.
She's been working really hard at this.
- You have a job.
- No, this is just an internship.
- Fix the lights.
- I'll call Butch.
Whatever! Look, Elena, I'm glad this is going well.
- But how much money have you made? - Seven thousand magic pebbles, redeemable for virtual stickers.
Elena, a real job is much more Boring.
Papito, no.
The other day, this guy came in with a rash that looked like a smiley face.
[LAUGHS] Come on.
I'm gonna return the shoes.
No.
You have a job.
And I hate that job.
I wanna do what Elena's doing or anything else.
You can't quit after one day.
Ew! I'm going to teach you a very important part of medicine.
How to take a patient history.
So, why don't you pretend to be Oh, I don't know your grandmother? That's weird.
But I'm super bored, so sure.
Great, great, great.
Okay.
First question.
Uh Age? [IMITATES LYDIA] A lady never tells.
Any allergies? My Cuban blood is far too strong.
Man, you are good.
Okay.
Okay.
- Favorite flower? - [IN NORMAL VOICE] That a medical thing? It's related to the allergies.
Just answer the question.
- I guess gardenias.
- Perfect.
Not so available.
Be busy sometimes.
And that is why you always wear gloves.
- Nurse Alvarez, do you have a second? - Yeah.
Of course I do.
Come in.
What can I do for you? I wanted to come back and tell you that you totally screwed me over.
[CHUCKLES] Excuse me? My insurance company is charging me for my physical, because it happened in the same 365-day period as my last one, and I'm covered for one a year! I'm sorry that's happening, but you did call and ask to be seen as soon as possible.
Mazzara from now on.
Send my stuff there.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll do that.
Try not to screw that up, too.
So, um, how was your day? Wanna talk? Nah.
I'm good.
What was the most interesting thing that happened? Okay, I'll go first.
[SIGHS] So, how about that guy that went off on you? [SCOFFS] Does that happen a lot? Sometimes.
[SIGHS] It's part of the gig.
Gotta put up with crap you don't want to.
Some days you're taking blood pressure, and you just wanna keep squeezing, and squeezing and squeezing until their stupid eyes pop out of their stupid head.
Dang, Mami! It's fine.
Put those headphones back on.
[SCREAMS] - I didn't push play yet.
- [EXHALES] Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm finally on pace to beat this speed run.
Only 57 failed attempts.
No big.
[CHUCKLES] Elena, what are the first few words of the Declaration of Independence? Leave me alone.
I know that's the gist of it.
Abuelita, I'm working.
Okay, fine.
I don't need you anyways, because I have Cuban tricks to remember American facts.
The American flag has 50 stars.
And Cuba has one.
Me.
I'm recording! What is going on now? I'm working and you're in my office! Elena, I had a long day at work.
Can I have five minutes of peace and quiet after I walk through the door? The usual? No, no.
Leave the bottle.
[SQUEALS] Elena, when is the last time you slept [SNIFFS] or took a shower? Those aren't options when you're building a brand.
I can help.
My subscribers expect constant content.
There's this couple in Bulgaria who are just waking up that I can't disappoint.
Dobro utro, Mr.
and Mrs.
Berbatov.
Wait.
Dude, you're in the final castle.
I know.
Butch was busy, so I was doing a little sleuthing on the electrical panel.
Question.
Did the power go off for a couple seconds? I have to start over.
I'm gonna kill you! - Whoa! You seem stressed, boss.
Coffee? - Get over here! [SCREAMING] [PENELOPE] Stop it! Yeah! And, girl, you smell rank.
And like violets? - Get out! - Okay, all right.
Breathe.
Come on, baby.
Last time I went to the bathroom, 18 hours ago, I looked in the mirror, and all I saw was a wildling.
I tried to swipe her away, but I couldn't.
And she was trying to swipe me.
Yeah.
You're not doing this anymore.
It's over.
What? Actually, thank you so much.
I thought playing video games for a living would be amazing.
Yes.
It's okay.
You're 16.
You don't need to build a brand.
You need to make a little money, so you could feel good about yourself.
I know I told you my first job was hard, but, um, was it? I spent the whole summer eating free ice cream and flirting with Joe Camarda.
Sounds pretty good.
Especially if Joe were Jodi.
And you will.
'Cause when you're an adult, work is terrible.
When you're not taking someone's pee, you're taking their crap.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR] Ay, Leslie.
For me? Hi, Lydia.
I forgot you lived here.
Penelope, you remember Liese Aucoin? She was the patient with all of the back pain.
Yeah.
And we discovered it was lymphoma.
But we caught it early, she made a full recovery.
And just last week, she had a baby girl.
She said that she never would've had a daughter without you.
And so she named her Penelope.
Oh So, what I'm hearing is this is not my gift basket? Mom, that's awesome.
Yes.
You see? Work isn't always terrible.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I got something for you, young man.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Good work this week.
Thank you.
See? When I asked you to come work with me, Alex, these are the things I wanted to share.
- You know, this is what's important - Oh, my God! $80! Yeah! Okay.
That's important, too.
Check me out, I'mma make it rain.
It's more like a drizzle, but all right.
Congratulations, papito.
Man, I worked so hard and I never even made any money.
Here you go, sweetheart.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, Schneider.
I noticed you finally fixed the lights in the laundry room.
Bravo.
Ah, it was the least I could do.
Also, I didn't do it.
See, I realized why I wasn't happy at work.
Because you never push yourself and you have the soft, white hands of a geisha? Oh Arigato.
Check it out.
I'm Butch.
- [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - [CHUCKLES] Mmm! "I love you.
" From P.
Who's P? Papito.
I text myself encouragements.
I love you, too, papito.
Look at you, all in love with your secret girlfriend.
[CHUCKLES] Hey, come on, no phones at dinner.
- [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - [CHUCKLES] What? This could be Dr.
Berkowitz.
But you laughed.
Leslie's jokes are not funny.
Knock, knock.
Who's there? Who cares? Well, he was nice enough to let me come home early so we could eat together.
He had plans, so it worked out.
Why do you care anyway? Aren't you two just friends? SÃ­, of course.
Did he turn right or left out of the parking lot? Just look at his Facebook.
He checks in everywhere.
Last week, he checked in at his attorney's office and wrote, "Hashtag, my daughter is suing me.
" Syd and I would never stalk each other on social media.
I don't want to stalk him.
I want to know exactly where he is and follow him there.
- Show me, papito.
"Hashtag, just checked in downtown at the opera.
" But I always accompany him to the opera.
[SCOFFS] It's not like he took another woman! [ALL LAUGH] You think so? Mami, no.
Because that's ridiculous.
He probably took a family member.
Yeah.
Like his daughter, who is suing him.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] take whoever he wants.
Â¡Carajo! Yeah.
That ain't chill.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] I'm going to the opera.
Mami, really? You're gonna go spy on Dr.
Berkowitz? How are you going to hide looking like the Latina Breakfast at Tiffany's? I'm not wearing earrings.
He will never recognize me.
My God, Mami, this is crazy.
Also, opera tickets are expensive.
For the longest time, I thought she was saying, "Your father is with Rebecca, that horse!" I need to put on my lipstick.
Okay.
So your secret girlfriend is P Pearl? Patricia? Padmini? Ooh Maybe P's not a student.
Mrs.
Perez, the lunch lady? Yeah.
I have a thing for hairnets and tater breath.
I am going to find out who your secret girlfriend is.
Papito, if you have a secret girlfriend, I need to know about it.
But, um [CLICKS TONGUE] We doin' real good.
[CHUCKLES] All right.
So you guys exclusive? Yeah.
Of course.
I mean, I Well, I think.
I keep him pretty busy with our regular once-a-week thing.
Let me just check my calendar.
Yep.
He has a full-time job.
- You met him at work, didn't you? - Why don't you shut up? [SIGHS] Is this something I should worry about? Max probably has women throwing themselves at him.
Can't argue with you there.
He could have anyone, but he chose you.
Okay, I know that's not the end of that sentence.
So, Schneider, are you ready for the opera? You mean our secret spy mission, Lydia? The name is Bond.
James Lydia Margarita del Carmen Inclan Maribona Leyte-Vidal de Riera Bond.
[INSTRUMENTS TUNING] Do you see him? No.
He's sitting next to a woman! [GASPS] What does she look like? Old.
Very old.
It's like someone wheeled in her coffin and dumped her into her seat.
Must be his mother.
I'm glad there's nothing to worry about.
Can we stay? We haven't even heard the fat lady sing.
That's where that comes from.
No! [STUTTERS] What's happening? I was wrong.
What's next? Throw a mint julep in his face? I am going to grab him by the aguacates and feed them to that soprano! Not as fun.
But I'm down.
[MAX MOANS SOFTLY] [CHUCKLES] That's nice.
Especially that.
I came over here to talk.
I want to talk about what's going down.
The sitch.
Ya feelin' me? - I would like to be.
[GRUNTS] Yeah.
We never really talked about it.
It's not a big deal.
Whatever.
But are you? - Yeah.
- [SCOFFS] Since when? Since last night.
But don't worry, we just cuddled.
[SHUDDERS] That is so much worse! [SIGHS] This is Luna.
[SCOFFS] You really got me going there.
I was about to go all psycho on you.
I was looking to see what I could set fire to.
I had my eye on that football.
But it doesn't matter.
What's important is you're not sleeping with anyone.
Just me, myself and I.
I still need to hear you say it, though.
Ew.
Do we have to call it that? That's what you want, right? To be a couple? A couple of people who don't sleep with anyone else and don't need labels! [CHUCKLES] It's still 45 minutes once a week.
Ten minutes of blah, blah.
ten minutes of eats and drinks, five minutes of [KISSES] fifteen minutes of [GRUNTING] And five minutes of "Where's my bra?" Up top! Hey, Alex.
You won't tell us who your secret girlfriend P is.
So, we pulled up your Instagram and narrowed it down to 15 possible girls.
Incidentally, "15 possible girls" would be a great name for a genderqueer punk band.
I know she's crazy, but, Syd, come on, you're better than this.
- Is it her? - No.
- Is it her? - That's Selena Gomez! I wish.
Me, too.
What? I have a type.
Wait, it didn't occur to me until now, but P could totally be a boy.
[ALEX SIGHS] Elena, I've been waiting for the right time to tell you but I'm straight.
Feels good to say it out loud.
Come on, Alex, let us help you.
[CHUCKLES] I'll say.
Please don't say.
If I tell you some stuff, can you leave me alone? I can't guarantee that, but spill! [SIGHS] Okay! Her name is Paige.
She doesn't go to our school, she's at St.
Teresa's, and she's left-handed and lactose intolerant.
She seems interesting.
She's flawed and she's comfortable announcing it.
- I like her.
Oh, good, 'cause I really cared.
- Why have you been keeping her a secret? - It's not respectful.
Um None of my friends like her and I wish we could all hang out.
So if you like her, then who cares what other people think? What do you want, Alex? I want this to end.
But I'd also like to keep seeing her.
Then do what makes you happy.
Thanks, guys.
That actually does help.
What are you doing? You said to do what makes me happy.
So, peace! I cannot believe that Leslie is with that woman.
And she is letting him hold her hand like a Dirty horse? [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] Let's make him jealous.
Dale, put your arm around me.
[LAUGHS] Ay, no! Now, I am going to drop my program and you will check out my fondillo.
What's a fondillo Oh, there it is! So, look for me.
What are they doing now? Uh Well, she's letting go of his hand.
Ooh, looks like she's heading for the bathroom.
Is it Scarlet Sunrise? - Yes, it is.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] How did you know? - It is my shade.
[LAUGHS] - Ah I really like those heels.
Marshalls.
Worth $50 but I got them for $10.
Never pay full price for fabulous.
So are you, eh Are you here with your husband? On a date.
With a very nice doctor.
Mmm.
- [CHUCKLES] What does he do? Did I mention he is much younger? [SIGHS] I should get back.
- Me, too.
It was very nice meeting you.
- Mm-hmm.
And what is your name? Esme.
It was a pleasure to meet you, too - Lydia! - [GASPS] How do you know my name? I know everything about you and Leslie! You're the wallpaper on his phone! I tried to make him delete it, but neither of us knows how.
EstÃºpido smartphone.
I'm Puerto Rican.
And I'm Cuban! [EXCLAIMS] When did you arrive? In '62.
[CHUCKLES] What about you? In '74.
That's great! it seems Leslie has a type.
I'm like the younger, taller, more attractive version of you, who is smarter as well.
Well, I look younger than you.
And I feel taller than you.
And after me, they broke the mold.
And that is me! Ah, you think so, huh? - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [GASPING] - [CACKLES] - [SCREAMING] That shade has been discontinued! I know.
I bought a case of it before they sold out.
- [EXCLAIMS] - [LAUGHS] Stay away from my friend! I spoke to Max and he is not seeing anyone else.
Oh, good.
So, he's not sleeping with or dating anyone else? Why'd you separate those things? - What things? - Sleeping together and dating.
'Cause they're different.
No, they're not.
Are they? [GROANING] Oh, my God.
That's so weird you follow him, 'cause you don't even follow me.
So I can read your boring inspirational quotes? "You can spell impossible without 'I'm possible.
'" My cousin, Christina, texted me and told me she needed that! Okay, so I don't see any pictures of women on here.
- That's a good sign, right? - Not necessarily.
We need to check out what he's tagged in.
- Oh - What? What? What is it? I don't think I should tell you.
Women in your family don't handle these things well.
The manager of the opera said your mother was the biggest diva he's ever seen.
At the beach, where she's falling out of her bikini top! Wow I don't think Meggy's ever seen her leggies.
Are those all things you got from Dr.
Berkowitz? Who? And yes! [LAUGHS] Remember when he bought you this jar opener at the Dollar Store? That's what that is? I thought it was a ThighMaster.
[SIGHS] Ay, Mami I know you say you're just friends, but admit it.
You have feelings for him, don't you? Bueno, I will admit that I am sad to lose him.
The cheater! - Who is just my friend.
- [CLICKS TONGUE] But you can't really be mad at Dr.
Berkowitz.
- But I don't want him to.
- But you can't control that.
- But I don't like it.
- But it's not fair to him.
- Oh - What's wrong? I just realized I'm you.
One can dream.
Okay, so, I know you're not sleeping with anyone else.
But are you dating someone else? I don't know if you know this, but those are two separate things.
But I want more.
Right.
So, I mean, do I like you? Yeah, I do.
A lot.
Why do you think I have a bottle of rosÃ© in my fridge? Or DVR Scandal? Or have a throw? I'm not a rosÃ©-drinking, Scandal-watching guy with a cold lap.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] But on the off-chance you want to spend some actual time together I have all those things ready.
What was that? You taped Scandal for me.
[CHUCKLES] I'm four behind.
Can't you look into my eyes and see what I'm trying to say? Guys can't do that.
You gotta say it.
[SIGHS] Fine.
I want to be your girlfriend.
And that would make me your Boyfriend.
Oh, my God.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [SIGHS] So When do you think you might tell Leggymeggy35 to beat it? Later tonight? Or right now is as good a time as any.
Ooh, I could, but my family's gonna be really upset.
- Mmm.
When do you think you'll tell your family we're dating and I'm not Schneider's friend? 'Cause that's an embarrassing thing to have people think.
Okay, everybody, I have an announcement.
All right, everybody, I'm seeing somebody.
- [LYDIA] Oh - [ELENA] Ooh! Who is he? Or she? Or they? [SIGHS] She's been like this all day.
It is a man.
Oh - It is a stallion! - [SCOFFS] Everybody say hi again.
- Hi, Max.
Did you want a wedding in a church or a wedding on the beach? There is a right answer.
Okay, everybody say bye to Max! - Bye.
- [ELENA] Bye, Max! We'll have you over for dinner real soon! Okay.
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Hey.
Hi, everyone.
We all have stuff to do, right? Yeah, I'm actually meeting a friend for pizza.
Oh.
[DOOR CLOSES] I suppose I owe you an explanation.
No need.
This is my curse.
Everybody falls in love with me.
They can't have me and it drives them to do crazy things like date women who look like me after being hit by a typhoon.
I'm sorry if I hurt you, Lydia.
The only reason I went out with Esme is that you made it very clear that you wanted to just be friends.
And I want more than that.
But to tell the truth I could never really give my heart to you because it already belongs to someone else.
Berto.
[SHAKILY] He is the love of my life.
And I cannot see myself being romantic with anyone else.
It is how you say I am exclusive.
[SNIFFLES] I understand.
And, you know, things really don't have to change between us.
We could still be friends.
We had some wild times, didn't we? Yes.
And the opera.
[INHALES DEEPLY] [SPEAKING SPANISH] allow you to take a more beautiful and elegant woman who is smarter as well.
So I I guess it's over? Oh! Wait.
Wait.
I have something to give you.
It is Scarlet Sunrise.
For your new friend.
I'm so glad.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Hey, you know, maybe one day the two of you could be friends.
I would rather eat my own hand.
I don't get it, Syd.
I mean, he took his lactose-intolerant girlfriend for pizza? [CHUCKLES] Clearly we have more work to do.
All right.
Keep you posted.
Papi? [DOOR CLOSES]
- So that's a yes.
- [CHUCKLES] Yeah.
Can't believe they're letting us take her home.
Last time I changed her diaper, I left my watch in there.
I know.
I heard her butt ticking and thought it was going to explode.
And then it did! Since you're recovering from a C-section, no intercourse for six weeks.
Six weeks? Six weeks! I don't know if I could wait six weeks.
I may never have sex again.
[SIGHS] Sorry, I was told that this room was empty.
This is usually where I come to cry.
Oh, look at your beautiful baby! Thank you.
They're so great at this age, before they can talk.
My girls, they're off in college.
That's nice.
Now my wife can yell at me in peace.
BERKOWITZ CHUCKLES] - That's funny.
- [CHUCKLES] I'm Doctor Leslie Berkowitz.
I'm a GP that works in the building.
But I love coming down to the maternity ward.
I find it so comforting.
Especially after I've lost a patient.
- Ugh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, don't worry.
And now, here come the tears again.
I I'm just going to find a broom closet somewhere.
Everything's fine.
[CHUCKLES] Wow.
Yeah, I pity the sorry-ass nurse that has to work for that guy.
[BOTH LAUGHING] - All right.
You ready to go? - Wait.
What about the car seat? - I installed it perfectly.
- Of course.
And then your mother reinstalled it again.
And then they started arguing, and then they started making out.
When I left, they were salsa dancing in the parking lot.
[GRUNTS] You know what we need? A safe word.
For when our parents start invading our space.
We'll make it military so they don't understand.
- How about FUBAR? - Oh! My mom'll think it's a Chinese nightclub.
It's good.
[EXHALES SHARPLY] If this one ever gives me lip, I'll say, "They sliced me open, put all my organs on a plate just to get you out of me, so zip it.
" I like this.
You're the bad cop.
Which means I'm the good cop.
[SIGHS] I can't even imagine making this girl mad at me.
- Don't talk to me! - Calm down! - You're totally overreacting.
- Overreacting? Hey, hey! What's going on here? He's been lying about having a girlfriend.
The "P" in his phone was Papi.
He's been sneaking around and seeing him.
What? Your papi's back in the country? Since when? About three weeks ago.
He has a month off and he's staying with TÃ­a.
You've been seeing him without telling me? It's not as bad as it sounds.
I knew you wouldn't like it, so I made up a girlfriend, then met Papi in secret so you wouldn't find out.
No, that's as bad as it sounds.
Papito, you're making me side with Elena, and it's very upsetting.
I'm upset because you lied to me.
Papi said it was easier this way.
You all hate him, so why make trouble? - This way everybody's happy.
- We are not happy! I should be smothering you with kisses right now, but instead I am frowning.
Ay, my lips are so confused! I thought you had my back.
You know what he did, but I guess you're fine with it, huh? - Elena - I will never forgive you for this.
[SIGHS] What are we supposed to do, Mom? Ignore him forever? [SPEAKING SPANISH] I have not spoken to my sister Mirtha for over 20 years.
What she did was unforgivable! You don't remember what it was, do you? She knows what she did.
We will get you a new one.
[SIGHS] Pero, Berto, this shawl is from Spain! It belonged to my abuelita who stole it from her abuelita's sister.
Mi amor.
Put away your anger.
Let's focus on our beautiful granddaughter, and enjoy seeing our Lupita in the glow of motherhood.
[SPEAKS SPANISH] I may have just peed.
Anyway, I'm sorry I was gone so long.
I fell asleep in the lobby.
It is embarrassing! How will they know it's a girl? Perhaps the pink bow, pink blanket, pink cross around her neck And the earrings tie it all together! It only takes two minutes to pierce one ear.
It takes six minutes to pierce the other because they know what's coming.
- Get me a piece of ice and a safety pin.
- Papi, no! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Wassup? You guys are Mexican, right? I recognize the lingo.
Actually, we're Cuban, Sugar Ray.
I love Cuba! I've been there four times.
You guys get back a lot? No, we were forced to flee our homeland.
Respect.
Now don't get attached, job's just temporary.
- My father owns the building.
- [ALL EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH] Yeah, I'm just doing him a solid.
I'm really a musician.
Play a lot of rap-rock-ska.
I'm like a male Gwen Stefani.
A Glen Stefani.
How intriguing! - May I ask, do you speak Spanish? - Not a word.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, cool baby! Wow.
How old is the little guy? - She is five weeks old - [BABY CRYING] and awake again.
Will someone tell my precious angel to go to sleep? I don't know why, but every time I put a dress on her, she spits up! So you're a single mom? Happily married to my husband who just got out of the army.
Yeah, I'm seeing somebody too.
We both just got out of the army.
My husband is starting up a security business with some of his buddies.
I'm going back to medical school to become a doctor.
Why am I telling you all these things? I'm so tired.
Word to the wise.
When you're hiring a nanny, make sure she's not too hot.
That's how I met my fifth mom.
So nice of you to stop by! [CHUCKLES] - Anyway, okay.
- [MOUTHING] Okay.
Yeah, hiring a stranger to watch my kid would bring shame to my people, so Okay, but I had four nannies and look at the results.
I promise you, that bobo will never set foot in this apartment again.
Ay, Mami, Mami, is she sleeping? Yes.
I just got out of the army.
I'm strong.
I escaped Cuba.
I am stronger.
Yeah, you're both very macho.
Can you put the box of pillows over there, please? Hey.
I just talked to Brian and business is heating up.
- Good.
Did the nurse say six weeks? 'Cause now it's seven.
Okay, I think we're good.
You guys can head home.
Hey, wait, this box says "Lydia's clothes" on it.
"Box one of 13"? It's time to talk.
Um Your mami and I have a proposal.
We're moving in with you.
What? Mi vida, you have to put it in the form of a question - so they think it's their decision.
Are we moving in with you? Yes.
It's not enough that we're close by.
You need Double A, 24/7.
- "Double A"? - Abuelito and Abuelita.
[CHUCKLING] You are so clever.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] FUBAR! Okay, I mean, we could convert the dining room into a bedroom.
- Put up a curtain.
- What? A curtain? Never! A curtain is just a wall with no self-respect.
We said all that before we realized how hard this was.
I'm opening a business.
You're going to medical school.
Look how tired you are! I just have my eyes closed so I don't have to see that.
Hey.
What's the big deal? We're Cuban.
Literally everybody we know who has a baby lives with their parents.
'Cause I just wanted to be the first, you know? Like the first Cubans to go to the Moon.
But we are not living with them, they are living with us.
Whatever you need to tell yourself.
Hey, Double A's.
We have decided that you can move in with us.
A toast.
To you, Victor, my darling Lupita my sweet angel Elena.
Truly, today is the first day of the rest of your lives.
Gracias, Papi.
And I promise we will stay out of your hair and we will respect your boundaries.
- Gracias, Mami.
- Mm-hmm.
[COOS] Did you pierce Elena's ears? [LYDIA] She didn't even cry.
She was one tough baby.
I want to be mad, - but she looks so cute.
- Yeah.
[ALL USING BABY TALK] - She looks so cute.
In my defense, I didn't think I'd get caught.
Victor, cut the crap and explain yourself.
It was just easier this way, okay? You don't want to see me, I don't want to see you, I got to see Alex.
He can't be sneaking around on me.
He's my son.
He's my son too.
I have a right to see him.
You do.
- Gee, why do you think that? - I know what I did.
I was mad! But I told you to keep this gay whatever thing between us! You parade her in front of my family and friends in a suit? Come on.
You were telling everybody.
[SCOFFS] I am not going to explain to you why all of that is so wrong.
Good.
I already heard it from Alex.
Well, good for him.
But even if you still have issues with me, what? You're just never gonna talk to your daughter again? Of course I will.
Back when she was a baby, I have never seen a person love someone so much.
[BREATHES SHAKILY] [SINGING IN SPANISH] All right.
This isn't working out.
How about "Bootylicious"? Oh, my God, babe.
Have you heard of this thing called sleep? After you do it, you're not tired.
Big fan.
Highly recommend it.
Yeah.
- [LYDIA LAUGHS] I just discovered this.
It is fantastic.
It makes everything so dramatic! [CHUCKLES] - I'm glad you're happy.
- I'm more than happy, Lupe.
This apartment is heaven.
I will never leave.
I like this thing too.
[BABY CRYING] Let me get her.
- [CRYING STOPS] - [VICTOR] All right, yeah.
- Okay.
I'll get breakfast too.
Although that looks good.
Yeah.
I'm real sexy right now.
Get out of here.
Okay, you eat, while Mommy finds out where in the world is Matt Lauer.
So all of this is unconfirmed.
And, of course, speculation of a terrorist attack is unconfirmed, although that is what some Pentagon officials are saying.
Babe, come here.
- What's wrong? - Look at what's happening in New York.
[COURIC] Let's go to President Bush.
[PRESIDENT BUSH] Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America.
I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington None of us will ever forget this day.
Yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.
I spoke to Brian earlier.
- Does he know anything? - No, but he's re-enlisting.
Oh.
All right, you can run the business by yourself.
Lupe, I'm re-enlisting too.
[SIGHS] Yeah.
I have to.
I get what you're feeling, babe, and I'm feeling it too, but we had a plan.
That was yesterday.
All the training, and the drills, and the sacrifice That was in case something like this happens.
- We have a five-week-old daughter.
- Yes, and she is why I'm doing this.
Look, she's so pure, and innocent, and perfect.
There's no way I'm gonna let her grow up in a world where that happens.
[SNIFFLING AND CRYING] If this turns into war, you're infantry.
And then you could Baby, baby, baby.
And that's what a father does.
Okay? Then, I'm going to re-enlist too.
- No, you don't have to do that.
- I know.
But I want to.
We'll move back on post somewhere.
It's the best chance for all of us to be together.
Hopefully, this doesn't turn into anything.
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] I don't think I can tell them.
I get it, but they'll understand.
They had parents that had to make difficult decisions so they could be free.
We're doing the same for Elena.
It's all about her.
Who knows where you and I might be if I think about that every day.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR] - Elena.
- Elena No.
[SIGHS] 'Cause I've decided that there's no point in focusing on the negatives.
I'd rather think about the good things that came from this.
Like, um [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You taught me a really valuable lesson.
Just because I'm gay, people will hate me without knowing anything else about me.
[BREATHES DEEPLY] [ELENA] I always knew that was part of the deal.
I just I never expected it from my own father.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] But now I know not to expect the best from anyone.
So, thanks, I guess.
Like I'm tough.
I'm really tough.
And when I do stumble, I have the most amazing mom who is always right there to pick me up.
So whatever, dude.
I'm moving on with my life.
I'm gonna be fine.
I'm just really bummed out for you.
[SNIFFLES] You're gonna miss stuff.
Yeah.
[VOICE BREAKING] Yeah, you are.
[WHISPERS] I'm sorry.
[VICTOR INHALES DEEPLY] - Abuelita, are there batteries in here? - Hmm? What is this? Some kind of shawl? [GASPS] No! No! It is not a long-lost mantilla from Spain that nearly ripped the family apart! I should call Mirtha.
Meh.
- Alex - What'd I do now? Everything.
[BREATHES DEEPLY] We just saw your papi.
He said you were trying to mend things between him and your sister.
Building bridges.
You know, Papi even said you called him a typical cisgender male.
- I couldn't be more proud.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So, is everything cool with you guys now? Mmm I don't know if we're cool, but we're talking.
That's a start.
Come here.
[CHUCKLES] [PENELOPE AND ELENA SIGH] Can everybody stop hugging me? SÃ­, back away.
I haven't had my turn.
I love you, dumdum! See, this makes me so happy.
I couldn't stand seeing you mad at each other.
You've always been so close.
[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] Hey.
[GASPS] Meet your new baby brother.
Alejandro Alberto Alvarez Riera Calderon Leytevidal Inclan.
I hate him! I don't want a baby brother! I want a puppy! Well, she better get used to it.
We're not getting a puppy.
Dang! A tequila shot.
But it really burned.
And it got my shirt all wet.
My hero.
Thank you, Lydia.
If you were my medic, I would've faked an injury.
Stop it, Max.
Just kidding.
Even though you are the embodiment of the alpha male, which normally I find [RETCHES] Looking at you up close with your chiseled features and your blue-green eyes with speckles of gold I get it.
I like it here.
Okay.
Can my mother and my daughter please stop trying to seduce my boyfriend? It's kind of annoying how easy it was for you to charm them.
[GROANS] I'm off my game.
Took me the whole dinner.
With you, it was three minutes of small talk, then, boom.
Okay, yeah.
Well, it's your turn next week.
Elaine and Bernie Ferraro are excited to meet you.
Heads up, my dad's been listening to Spanish language tapes, so I'm not sure what that's gonna be.
My mother almost open-mouth kissed you, so the bar is low.
- [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - Oh.
I got it.
- "Pill time"? - Yeah.
That is a reminder for somebody.
She doesn't know how to use this thing.
Okay.
So, Mami, you'll remember to take your pill, right? In the mouth this time? SÃ­.
SÃ­, of course.
I take pills because I am so forgetful.
Where am I? This is not Cuba.
- Okay.
- [PENELOPE] That's great.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
I don't want Max to know I'm on antidepressants.
Oh, pero, of course you don't want to tell him.
It's humiliating.
- It's not humiliating.
- Oh, no? Then I will tell him.
Oh, shut your mouth! Or I'll tell him you don't have eyebrows! [GASPS] Okay.
Things we really need.
- Mami, your pills are to prevent a stroke.
- A stroke is all up here.
- You need to keep taking those pills.
- Okay! I'll stay a druggie.
- But I need some help.
Max? - Â¿SÃ­? I have to take a pill.
But as we both know, I am old and weak, so can you carry me to the bathroom? Okay.
But yesterday, I was in the cookie aisle and I was sweating.
Too many options.
Next thing you know, I'm hyperventilating in a bag of Milanos.
Then I had to buy those.
- And I don't have no money for Milanos.
- [ALL LAUGH] Okay, this is why you need to keep using the coping tools we've been talking about.
Meditation, exercise, doing service Or maybe just stay out of the snack aisle, girl! [LAUGHS] I'm sorry, Pam.
Tools are great.
Yes.
Sometimes our brains lie to us.
I knew I needed help when I heard a recording of myself played back.
I was wasted, slurring obscenities at a toaster about my abandonment issues.
I did the same thing! Except, instead of a toaster it was a cop.
Recording our thoughts is a very useful tool.
Hearing them played back gives you some perspective, as though someone else were talking.
So, like, "Hello, Penelope.
Trust me.
It helps.
Wait, you haven't shared yet today, Penelope.
Which, for you, is unusual.
Well, I gotta be honest, guys, I'm feeling great.
And my toolbox is closed and under the bed.
Well, it's wonderful to hear that you're doing so well, but No, not just "well.
" Freaking fantastic! Like, school, work, the kids It's all amazing.
He is.
I'm actually gonna meet his parents next week.
And my family loves him.
And I'm gonna stop talking because it looks like Ramona might wanna punch me in the face.
You're not wrong.
But I'm happy for you.
- Hello! - Hi! Hello, Mami! Okay.
Are you going to put me in a home? - No, Mami, we don't do that.
I just really need your advice on something.
Okay, mi vida.
What problem can I solve for you? Well, I'm meeting Max's parents soon and I want to make a good impression.
- So you want me to come? - No.
I need you to tell me what to wear! [LYDIA SPEAKS SPANISH] Okay.
This one shows off my tetas, this one shows off my nalgas, but we can find one that shows off both.
Ah, sÃ­! Give the people what they want! - [WHOOPS] - [BOTH LAUGH] Maybe we can go dress shopping Tuesday night.
Perfect! Oh, no! Isn't that when you're having your cuckoo party? You mean group therapy? Yeah, well, actually, I've decided to stop going.
Now I have more time for the kids and for you and me to hang out.
Let's go shopping! I might need a new lipstick.
- What's the matter? Are you tearing up? - [CRIES] You really are my daughter.
There was a period of ten seconds when the doctor took you out of the room and I have always wondered.
But no more! - [CRIES] - [CHUCKLES] - [PENELOPE] Thanks, Sister Barbara.
- Great CPR presentation, Mom.
Yeah, Mom, the presentation was amazing.
If this whole thing wasn't about saving lives, I'd say you killed it.
[CHUCKLES] Somebody asked if you were a sister.
As in of Christ.
Why do you feel the need to ruin people's joy? I went too far with the Sister Barbara joke.
No! Are you kidding? Everyone thought it was hilarious.
Yeah.
Even Sister Barbara laughed.
I had never seen her teeth.
I always assumed she had fangs.
Teachers have it hard enough, and then I make a joke at her expense? Like, "Great! Make a teacher feel bad about her job.
Nice work, Penelope.
" Mom, you did great.
Don't worry.
- I don't think before I speak.
- Who does that? Yeah, Mom, it's all good.
Let's go eat.
- We'll go get our stuff.
I'm kinda amped up, and You know what? I'm gonna go for a run.
What? Why? I've wanted to get back into exercising and now I have time.
- I'm just gonna jog home.
- Now? Yeah! It's only a mile and a half.
- Oh, hey, Pen! - Hey.
Wow, you're all sweaty.
Oh, my God! If you joined an adult kickball team after saying you were too busy to join mine, you are on a long road to forgiveness.
- [SNIFFLES, PANTING] I went running.
I can't talk to you right now.
You don't want to talk to Max? What's wrong with you? Do you know how hard it is to get him on the phone? I've left like 60 voicemails.
I'm just in a weird mood.
I messed up the presentation at the kids' school, verbally abused a nun.
I'm adjusting to being off my meds.
I'm having caffeine late in the day.
I'm just a little stressed out.
Definitely want to hear about the verbal nun smackdown.
It was time.
It's fine.
Sure, sure, sure.
But is that really a DIY situation? I'm a nurse.
I know what I'm doing.
Do you know you just ran a 5K in scrubs? Why am I talking to you about this anyway? Your idea of stress is when your chest waxer goes out of town.
Roberto is the only one who doesn't make it sting! I would kill to have your problems.
Too much money, too much free time, too many parents.
- Hey.
I've been around enough to know when people are not okay, and you don't seem okay.
I get where you're coming from.
You have no idea where I'm coming from! You've had everything handed to you! You had to get hooked on drugs just to be interesting! You don't sound like yourself.
I'm gonna go.
[LYDIA CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS] Lupita, wake up.
I'm up.
Bueno, it's 7:45.
I was delirious and no one even noticed a difference.
I can miss work for one day, Mami.
You don't feel fever-y.
I don't feel well.
I know my body.
Please, just let me sleep.
Okay, mija.
I made you some sopa with fideos.
Let's cure this once and for all.
This cannot be cured with Vicks VapoRub.
Everything can be cured with Vicks VapoRub! It cured your TÃ­a Neni's appendicitis.
Her appendix was removed.
Who's to say which treatment helped her the most? I'm gonna go back to sleep, Mami.
I'm tired.
[SPEAKS SPANISH, SIGHS] I'll leave this right here.
Good, you're up! I hemmed your dress so it's ready for tonight! It's sexy but not too sexy.
I shouldn't have bought that dress.
It was stupid.
I spent too much money.
Now it's hemmed, and I can't take it back.
No, it's okay.
You deserve a nice dress.
No, I don't.
[EXHALES DEEPLY] I can't do this.
Let me help you.
You can't help me.
I don't understand what's happening.
Everything is so good! I mean, papito is perfection.
Elena is very smart.
Max is an Adonis who loves you.
And then there is me! Your life is full of blessings.
[SHAKILY] I know.
There is something wrong with my daughter.
And I don't know what happened.
She was doing so well that she stopped going to therapy, finally.
Things have never been better between my daughter and me.
And now I can't get her out of bed! - Did you try the Vicks VapoRub? - [SCOFFS] Of course! So your daughter is depressed? Oh, oh, yes, yes.
She's even taking medication for it.
You know, I don't understand these things.
Depression, anxiety, OCD I was just thinking about them the other night when I got up at 3:00 a.
Well, just because you don't feel those things, uh, doesn't mean they aren't real for her.
I wish I could take away her pain and feel it for myself.
That is what mothers are for.
SeÃ±ora, taking on someone else's suffering is not possible.
But is that not what Jesus did? Okay.
Good point.
I mean, you can't know and fix everything, including your daughter.
You can only be there for her while she fixes herself.
Good.
And remember, you are not God.
Ay I know that is true, but it's still hard to hear.
Hello, Penelope.
It's me, Penelope.
[SCOFFS] [SIGHS] This is so stupid.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR] Oh, hi.
You here to yell at me more? Maybe insult one of my mothers? Whoa.
What's going on? I did this thing where I recorded myself thinking out loud.
Can you just listen with me, please? [OVER SPEAKERS] Hello, Penelope.
It's me Penelope.
[SCOFFS] This is so stupid.
Isn't it so weird to hear your own voice out loud? You want me to listen to the whole thing and then comment? Gotcha.
[PENELOPE OVER SPEAKERS] I can't sleep.
It literally feels like the weight of my life is sitting on my chest.
[EXHALES] And then I see those kids [EXHALES] Those beautiful kids and I'm so tired.
But I can't teach them how to do that because I don't know how to do that myself.
I'm failing them.
I'm failing them.
They deserve so much better than me.
It's like when people tell me, "Be happy.
You have a great life.
" It makes me feel like garbage because I know.
But what's wrong with me that I can't appreciate that? That I can't feel it? And what's the point of living if you can't feel anything? [SIGHS] You were right.
I know.
But I think you know that healthy brains don't go to that place.
[SIGHS] You need to go back on your meds.
I don't want to be on a drug for the rest of my life! I shouldn't have to need it! I shouldn't have to need these either, but I do.
To see.
And to look rugged but also smart.
- It's not the same thing.
- Oh, no? Okay.
I'd been sober for a while, so I thought I'd celebrate with a beer.
Woke up three days later in an alley.
Then the bowling ball hit me.
I was in the gutter for a long time.
It's really slippery without the shoes.
That was the day I truly accepted that I can't have alcohol or drugs, ever.
Not a beer, not a glass of wine, not even six hits of acid at a Grateful Dead show, no matter how well it makes me dance.
I kinda get where you're coming from.
[SHAKILY] I'm really sorry about all the crap I said to you.
Ah! I can take it.
We're best friends.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, man! I think you might actually be my best friend.
Now I'm really depressed.
- Hello.
- Ay, Mami! Jesus! Mami, I thought you were a ghost.
Please, you cannot see ghosts.
Plus, the kitchen sink is not going to Fabuloso itself.
Are you feeling better? Not yet, but I'm gonna be.
Oh? So, not only did I stop going to therapy, but I also went off my meds a few weeks ago.
But I'm gonna go back on them.
And I'm going back to therapy.
I know my Cuban brain should be able to fight off the crazy like a matador in a bullfight or whatever.
But, Mami, I really I don't want to hear it.
Okay.
Hold on.
Is this some sort of reverse psychology? [SCOFFS] No.
I do not believe in psychology.
For me.
Thank you, Mami.
I love you, nena, and I just want you to be happy.
Hi! Got your text.
Glad your phone works.
We did not get what we wanted.
I hope you'll let me explain and make it up to you physically.
You have the floor.
I need to tell you something.
After you hear it, you can decide whether or not you still wanna be with me.
What is it? You have kids and live with your mom? 'Cause those are deal-breakers.
That [SIGHS] And I have depression and anxiety.
And I take medication for it.
Maybe you get it, maybe you don't.
That's what happened when I stood you up.
I tried to go off and [INHALES SHARPLY] Anyway, the meds help me stay in control of my life.
I'll probably have to be on them forever.
Okay.
So what's the thing that would make me not wanna be with you? 'Sup, bestie? Oh Making out with other bestie.
It's so awkward when your two best friends start dating.
What do you guys wanna do tonight? Oh, I got it.
My abuelita taught me how to make this when I was a little girl.
The key is to add just a little bit of cigar ash.
My abuelita used to put Vicodin in her coffee.
And her lemonade and her sandwiches.
Maybe she had a problem.
Okay, I'm finished.
No more leak.
Wow.
" By the power vested in me - by the Guild of the Custodial Arts - Not a thing.
It is a thing.
I'm the president.
I dub thee handyman.
Eh, check this out.
I was actually thinking "Handy ma'am.
" Oh, my [BOTH MIMIC EXPLOSIONS] Mami, where have you been? I've been cooking these frijoles for 20 minutes.
Ugh, I try to make a house a home.
That big one either hates me or is in love with me.
Either way, I don't like it.
- Why don't you just park in your garage? - What? - We don't have a garage.
- Yeah, you do.
It's part of the lease.
I figured you were using all the garages for storage.
Don't be ridiculous.
I use my garage for pickling and sea horse breeding.
It's [GROANS] Oh There seems to be a misunderstanding.
See, um [CLEARS THROAT] Little parched.
Let me just hydrate here.
[GULPING] Why did I not know I had a garage? I may have put a few things in there.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] [SCOFFS] I cannot believe that you've been hiding this from me all this time.
Oh? I thought I had mentioned it.
It rained for 17 days in a row this winter.
I walked from my car every night! Oh, I wish you had told me that.
Now I don't have to keep those traffic cones in my trunk to fake out my parking competition.
- Does that work? - When I wear my yellow vest, it does.
Come on, everybody, let's get this junk out of here so I can park my car! No, no! This is not junk.
I need everything here.
Really, Mami? You need a whole box of gardening gloves? We don't even have a garden.
What if papito wants to be Michael Jackson for Halloween? [IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON] I'll be Spider-Man.
There are, like, four boxes of dusty old magazines.
We could at least recycle them.
There is.
I'm not letting this go, Mother.
I'm done parking ten blocks away and being chased through the park by the geese! Ay, Lupita, relax, huh? Ah, mira.
Put this on and the geese will not chase you when they see what you have done to their friends.
Okay.
I will get rid of some stuff and papito will help me.
You make sure she does it.
Ooh.
Apartment 301.
Herb and Sherb McGurb.
Sherb? Her real name is Sheryl, but she gets a kick out of Sherb.
Ha-ha.
Hello, Herb, Sherb.
Schneider.
[GIGGLES] This is Elena Alvarez, my handyman mentee.
Or handy-manatee.
This is her first job, but don't worry.
I taught her everything I know.
- So, you good? You got your plunger? - Yes.
- Got your toilet snake? - Yes.
- Got your snack? - I'm not going to eat a snack while I plunge and snake a toilet.
The toilet is a cruel mistress.
[SIGHS] She is flush with complications.
She's ready.
No matter how much you're tempted, do not put them in your mouth.
So, did you get rid of some stuff? Even better than that.
No.
Papito helped me arrange everything so there's plenty of room for your car.
A little to the left.
[EXCLAIMING] [SPEAKS SPANISH, LAUGHS] Perfecto.
Can the garage door even shut? Uh, kind of.
See? Now back up so I can get out.
Since when do you do bonsai? [SCOFFS] Bonsai's for dorks.
This is penjing.
The gentle Chinese art of tray scenery.
Now that you're working for me, I finally have some leisure time.
Oh, look, there's little people.
Wait, is that my family? Could be any Cuban family.
I just came to tell you that I'm done fixing the McGurbs' toilet.
What? You were there for 20 minutes.
You must have done something wrong.
Actually, I noticed you just replaced the flapper, which is more of a Band-Aid.
So I went ahead and installed a pressure assist flush valve and now it's fixed for good.
You must have done something wrong.
Look, it's nothing against you.
I'm just a really quick learner.
Maybe I could help you be better.
[STAMMERS] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I was about to leave and I noticed that somebody clipped it because I had to park it with its big ol' butt sticking out of the garage! Oh, I was afraid of this.
The garage does not like you.
So, it's taking out its revenge.
Mami, no.
I've had it.
Now we have to spend money we don't have to fix the car.
Enough is enough.
You have to get rid of your junk.
I cleared out the exercise bicycle.
The lawn chair.
Even my old fabrics.
And you said there was no room for these things.
[CHUCKLES] Don't you feel foolish? [SIGHS] - You wanted to see me? - Yeah.
- You're fired.
- What? Why? I got a call from the McGurbs.
Herb is very perturbed.
I was completely polite and professional.
Yeah.
Those aren't the words Herb used.
For a pastor, he knows some salty language.
Anyway, walk me through everything you did while you were there.
Okay.
Well, they offered me some lemonade, and I said, "No, thank you " What? Always take the lemonade.
That's Handyman 101! [GROANING] Oh, my God! Okay.
- Is that some kind of Chinese proverb? - Probably.
[SIGHS] Elena, growing up, I had everything.
But I was always alone.
I don't want my tenants to feel that way, so I, I do more than just fix stuff.
Apartment 306, macramÃ© with Mrs.
Watson.
201, lose at chess to Mr.
Roth.
[SIGHS] That's the difference between being a handyman and a super.
Understand? Yeah, I guess.
I feel bad.
Should I go apologize to the McGurbs? Uh, during NCIS? Don't make it worse.
Okay, I feel weird.
My heart's beating out of my chest, my upper lip is sweating, and I feel like hiding and trimming a tiny tree.
Is this what failure is? Hey, hey, hey.
I know you'll do it right next time.
It's cool, right? Never said it before.
And I've heard it a lot.
Check it out.
Abuelito's guayabera almost fits me.
Ay, papito, you look so handsome! Just like your abuelo.
- [SOBS] - Abuelita, are you okay? [VOICE BREAKING] Just happy tears, papito.
Happy tears.
[SNIFFLES] Lots of very good memories.
That's not weird.
Don't listen to her.
You could be a model.
[LAUGHING] And you know what? We could be in a JCPenney catalog.
Hello.
I always loved Papi in this.
He always looked so elegant.
Ah.
Ay, thank you, Lupita.
You know, I was thinking about what you said and perhaps I don't have to keep everything.
Ah? [EXCLAIMS] I'm so glad to hear you say that, Mami.
Alex, bring up the Vanidades magazines so I can look through them and decide which to keep.
Actually, Mami, why don't you start with your VHS tapes of The Love Boat? Who died and made you Captain Stubing? We start with the magazines.
What? Okay.
So I didn't think you'd be reasonable about this so I took your Vanidades to the thrift store.
[GASPS] Mami, you were being impossible! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Ay, por favor, Mami, stop being dramatic.
What? They were going to mature soon.
And I was going to use the money to help me with Elena's college and papito's Barbizon Modeling School.
Mami, why didn't you keep them somewhere safe? Oh, you mean keep them in a secret garage, where even my own daughter didn't know for two decades? Ah, silly me.
I didn't see anything like that.
Come on.
There's no way you sold four boxes of dusty, old Spanish magazines in two hours.
I just sold a guy a used retainer.
Can you please check again? - Of course.
Oh, you want to play hardball? Okay.
Alex, how about we try on a bunch of clothes and put none of them back on the hangers and leave this place a freakin' disaster? This is a charity store for cancer patients.
I did not know that.
Look, if they're not in the store, they might be in the dumpster out back.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I am so sorry for what I said.
I am a nurse.
Okay, hop in and find the magazines.
What? I'm not going in there.
This is how most Law & Orders start.
Well, I'm not going in there.
But you're always talking about how strong you are.
"Oh, I'm a badass!" You know why you should go in there? I am a badass.
Ah.
I am sorry you are sad about your job.
that Julie, the cruise director, was so openly gay.
[SPUTTERS] What? Huh? All right, Mami, we got the Vanidades! [SPEAKING SPANISH] - Did you get all of them? - [PENELOPE] Yeah.
[LAUGHS] Okay, I'll start dinner.
Wait, where are you going? We have to find your savings bonds! Everybody, grab a stack and start looking.
Mami, come on.
Let's find the bonds! There are no bonds.
Excuse me? The things you're looking for? They do not exist.
Ha-ha! You You lied to me? Do you think if I had secret money I would be shopping at Marshalls? The answer is yes.
But what about my college? You'll get a student loan.
- What about my modeling school? - You'll get a scholarship.
Are you freaking kidding me right now? Don't mess with my stuff.
We spent the day in a dumpster! "We"? You threw away tu mami's most cherished cositas! Oh, I'm about to drop a match in mi mami's most cherished cositas! And I'm about to take a baseball bat to your precious car! Try me, vieja.
Ooh, ooh I will.
And I have six bats to choose from in the garage.
Wood, Wiffle, metal Mami.
I work my nalgas off to support this family, and I deserve a place to park my car! And besides, you never use any of this stuff anyway.
I know, and it's called Dancing with the Stars and it is fabulous! I meant Hoarders.
It is a sickness to keep worthless things.
I came to America with nothing! - All is valuable when you have nothing! - I get it [STAMMERS] But this broken lawn chair? A cracked teapot? Mami, what is this? This ratty, used umbrella.
Mami, what kind of value could this possibly have? I was at the park with your papi one day.
We were having a picnic to cheer him up because he had lost his job.
He was so worried about money, and I knew that the news I had to give him would not help.
So [INHALES DEEPLY] I took a big swig of rum and a slow drag on my cigar, and I told him I was pregnant with you.
It was the '70s! Anyways, it began to rain.
" And that was the first moment we spent as a family, under this umbrella.
That's beautiful, Mami.
You want to know what papi and I did on this lawn chair? No.
It may sound silly, but even those old magazines mean something to me.
Because it was all I could read when I got here, because they were in Spanish.
And they made me feel like a girl again, instead of just an exile.
[SIGHS] So, what do we do? You want to keep these things that matter to you, I need to park my car without being bitten by a goose.
I don't know how to fix this.
Ay, sÃ­.
They solve everything! [SIGHS] Ooh, and I didn't just build shelves in the garage, I built shelves in their souls.
That only works for toilets.
But I'm proud of you.
What you did here is really super.
Ooh, and I made us something.
I'm pretty excited about it.
[GRUNTS] Bam! We have handy caps! Yeah, we gotta talk about our branding.
Okay.
Ooh, Lydia, I think we moved the china to the other garage.
Other garage?
 Lupe, Max will be here soon.
Have you finished packing for your romantic vacaciÃ³n? Almost.
But we're gonna have to stop at the outlet mall on the way to Palm Springs because the only desert wear I have is this.
You need clothing? What kind of romantic vacaciÃ³n is this? - The kind that won't get us arrested.
- That happened one time.
School dances are barbaric events designed to make less popular kids feel bad.
They're for total narcissists.
Okay, eyes on me.
How fly are my vintage threads for the dance? [PENELOPE] Ooh.
Papito, you look so handsome in your abuelo's outfit.
- Who did you decide to go with? - This older girl, Emma.
She's older.
By two months.
It is not polite to talk about your girlfriend's fondillo, no matter how big it is.
No, Abuelita.
"Big ask.
" It's the way kids invite each other to dances now.
It's a whole obnoxious performance.
I am so glad Syd is home-schooled and not into this stuff.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, hey, Syd.
What's happening? I don't know, but I think Syd is wearing their grandpa's outfit too.
I thought we were going away for the weekend, but are we moving to Palm Springs? No.
This one's empty.
Yeah.
It's for the mini shampoos and soaps we're gonna snag from the hotel.
And this is for the free breakfast we're gonna swipe so we don't have to spend money on lunch.
I'll pay for lunch.
Maybe even splurge for Quiznos.
Damn, I didn't know I was dating a rich guy.
- [CHUCKLES] - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Don't answer, it's probably another bad singer.
[LAUGHS] Little privacy here? You knocked! Oh, yeah.
Nikki has some stuff she wants to tell you.
[BOTH CLEAR THROAT] As an active member of the St.
Bibiana PTA, and presidential candidate "Don't be picky, vote for Nikki.
" It is my duty to inform you you failed to complete your mandatory family volunteer hours.
- You done? [CHUCKLES] - Yeah.
Oh, stop that! I'm sorry.
But lucky you! I'm short on chaperones for homecoming tomorrow.
Come get your salsa on, chica.
That's not convincing me.
But I can't, because we're going to Palm Springs.
So you can just pay the fine.
It's $50 an hour.
And you're behind 20 hours.
So it's $1,000, no bigs.
I guess I'll see you at homecoming then.
It counts for five hours.
Bye! [CHUCKLES] I'm not voting for her.
- [POP SONG PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Whoa! School-schools are way bigger than home schools.
I can't believe it has its own ballroom.
This is a gym.
What? I'm gonna hit the restroom.
I cannot wait to meet all of your friends.
Why would Syd think you're popular? - You're only friends with the teachers.
- And the principal! I just I maybe didn't correct some false assumptions.
Syd knows I'm president of a lot of clubs and it's not my fault people hate powerful women.
The same thing happened to Hillary.
You can't say that about everything.
- Okay, how will you pull this off? - With this.
I can skim Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat and find a few facts about these ding-dongs to make it seem like we're friends.
I'm gonna talk to my actual friends, but I'm gonna leave you with this thought.
I had my blender packed and everything.
So that was the buzzing coming from your suitcase.
- I was worried slash excited.
- Oh! Well, thank you for doing this.
With your five hours, my mom's five hours, I'm almost caught up.
Happy to be here.
[GRUNTS] God! This place takes me back.
My first homecoming dance, Sister Barbara caught me hiding boxed wine in my top.
- Hello, Penelope.
- [EXCLAIMS IN SPANISH] Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Sister Barbara.
That's a very red dress.
And also, I see your bosoms have rounded out.
[LAUGHS] Oh We had our fun, didn't we, Sister Barbara? I know I was a bad girl, but I'm a nurse now.
And I was in the army.
Pride is a sin.
You know, all chaperones are required to wear black.
Did you receive my e-mail? I sent it through the Internet.
Oh, I don't use e-mail.
That's the devil's work.
[CHUCKLES] No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
Anyway.
Oh, bless.
Is he simple? Well, the Lord made you strong.
[SCOFFS] What the hell was that? Sorry, I have a thing for nuns.
- You do? - Yeah.
Small women that boss you around, make you do stuff.
Hot.
Why do you think I like you so much? [CHUCKLES] Hello, Sister Barbara.
Blessed be the fruit.
We're not married yet, but we've promised ourselves to each other.
Wonderful.
Is everyone ready for their assignments? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey.
How about if Max and I do dance patrol? We all know what goes on in the middle of a dance floor.
The farther you are from the chaperones, the freakier the freakin' gets.
We have a strict anti-freaking policy.
I don't think the situation would be helped by you in that dress.
Emma? Your teenage date? Nice to meet you.
How is she in ninth grade? Was she held back? Like, nine times? Seems like it, right? Let's get a picture.
[SIGHS] - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - Next! Oh.
Don't worry, guys, I'm here! Hey, Connor.
Remember when you had so much fun in Cancun in 2007? [CHUCKLES] I mean, you pet a stingray? Crazy! Elena, how come I never met these guys? You don't know my life.
Just take the picture.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - Got it.
- Hi, I'm Syd Okay.
You guys want one without her? [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Oh.
Hello? I cannot stop looking at you in that nun outfit.
- It is a choir robe.
- Eh, I can make it work.
See, this sucks.
I like to be near you when you're being pervy.
Oh, I gotta go.
Okay.
Hey, Doc.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
You're my last five hours.
Of course.
I have never been to a school dance before.
My mother was afraid I'd contract mononucleosis.
I never did.
Aw [CHUCKLES] Could you take over the photo booth for a minute? - I need to talk to Max.
Like this guy.
- Lupe? - What? Why is Leslie here? Is he stalking me? I asked him to come help finish my hours.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You said you were okay with him dating someone new.
Of course I'm okay.
It's him I am worried about.
I mean, seeing me look this fabulous? It is so cruel.
Where are you going? Mami, I think I just heard Max say he loves me.
I know! I can't stop thinking about it either.
On one hand, Nikki is a terrible person.
On the other hand, is it time for me to get married? [SIGHS] Excited to see this next chapter of your life unfold.
Bye! Hello, you.
Hey.
I'm just keeping an eye on Alex and his date.
He got pulled into the booty-dancing jungle and a loose woman told me that's where the freaking takes place.
Hey, good looking out.
Why have you abandoned the photo booth? The children are taking pictures of their rear ends.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was I was just keeping an eye on the dance floor.
You know, showing the kids what not to do.
Yeah.
Hey, kids, don't do this.
[GRUNTING] I do not like it! Elena! - Hey, Mrs.
Wallace.
[EXCLAIMS] You are really capturing her handsome severity.
- You're friends with your teacher? - No! She does this.
It's weird.
I'm friends with her! Hey, Suehee! Do I know you? Girl, your one-year anniversary since your braces came off? Hashtag, time flies.
- Let's just go dance over here.
- By the trash? Yeah.
I need some empty space to pop and lock.
[TANGO MUSIC PLAYING] Finally.
How is Esme? The woman whose name I refuse to mention.
Well, Esme and I actually have been taking dance classes.
Oh, really? Well, I guess she ruined you as a dancer.
She did not.
I was already ruined.
It's not her fault that She's so irresistible But all the damage she's caused Isn't fixable Every 20 seconds you repeat her name But when it comes to me We can't.
It is forbidden.
Objection I don't want to be the exception To get a bit of your attention I love you for free And I'm not your mother But you don't even bother Objection Oh, this used to be my spot.
Now that we are alone, I wanted to ask you something.
Earlier, on the phone, I thought I heard you say "I love you"? Yeah.
I did.
Why'd you say that? 'Cause I love you.
Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to choreograph that to a Billy Joel song? No.
Boyz II Men.
I wasn't planning on telling you at a school dance, across the room, on the phone.
But I've been thinking about it for a while and there you were in that sexy nun outfit.
- But you were planning on telling me? - At dinner in Palm Springs over a beautiful bottle of wine I won on the radio.
- Tell me what, exactly? - Come here.
I love you too.
Oh You know what I could use right now? Here? - Okay.
- [GASPS] Oh, I can't believe they're still here.
[GASPS AND LAUGHS] Whoa! Are you sure you want to do that? Those are 20 years old.
And they're cigarettes.
Hey, as long as I'm being a bad girl Oh, yeah.
You're on the rebound.
That's the best time to get married.
You don't have time to think.
Aw, that's so stupid.
But what about all that boyfriend stuff you said to Sister Barbara? I was trying to impress her.
I'm running for PTA president.
Hello? I told everybody else you were my manny.
So you were never thinking about me? My emotions? My feelings? - Oh, God, no.
Smoking in the hallway? And that's not all, Sister Barbara.
We knew each other.
Biblically.
And while we were doing it, she took the Lord's name in vain.
A lot! [UPBEAT SONG PLAYING] Whoo! I am all popped and locked out.
- And look at that, it's almost 10:00.
- It's 8:30.
And you're not wearing a watch.
- You do? - Yeah.
You're embarrassed of me.
What? No, no, no.
I'm not embarrassed of you.
I'm embarrassed of me.
I don't have very many friends.
Like, if I were to count them, I wouldn't say any numbers.
- This, it really isn't my thing.
You must have worked on that song for forever.
Actually, I just really got in the zone.
The lyrics were sort of writing me, you know? I pretended that these people were my friends, but, honestly, for some reason, I'm not that popular.
Hey, planet killer! Recycle that! I don't know what it is exactly.
I'm sorry I let you believe I was someone I'm not.
[SIGHS] Elena, I'm home-schooled.
My only classmate is my chinchilla.
[CHUCKLES] And Roxie's a total mean girl.
[BOTH CHUCKLING] We should probably make some friends.
Actually, I do have one friend here at the dance.
I haven't been kind to her tonight.
Hey, Mrs.
Wallace.
Elena.
I want you to meet my girlfriend, Syd.
Syd, this is my friend.
- I'm really sorry.
- I get it.
I was a teenager once.
Of course, I didn't have teachers as cool as me.
[BOTH CHUCKLING] Ooh, can we have this dance? Uh, yeah.
Let's show these losers how it's done.
Time after Sometimes you picture me I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me I can't hear what you've said Lydia.
Esme and I broke up.
[GASPS] Â¿CÃ³mo? Why? Because I realized you're the one I want to be with.
In whatever way it means to you.
Look, I don't know how much time I have left on this lonely, spinning space rock we call Earth but I know I don't want to spend it without you.
Ay, Leslie we're going to be friends again.
[LAUGHS] Come over tomorrow.
We will sit a respectable distance from each other and watch the Property Brothers.
[CHUCKLES] Now I'm blushing.
[LAUGHING] So, just to be clear just friends? Well, friends who occasionally hug.
Whoa! Keep your earrings on.
Dude, you are not looking at this the right way.
A ninth-grade girl, who I swear was on The Bachelor last season just used you to make another guy jealous.
And it worked.
You gotta be pretty cool for that to happen.
- [CHUCKLES] You think? - Are you kidding? And now you got that whole sad-puppy-dog thing going for you.
Girls eat that stuff up.
Hey! That's true, though.
They already know.
And just like that, he's back.
Can I have this dance? I am very impressed.
You were really great with Alex right now.
Oh.
Well, he's a great kid.
So is Elena.
Probably has something to do with their mom.
I can't wait to have kids.
Hey, here's to you guys.
- Ooh.
Tomorrow, you will be American citizens.
This is my last night with a bunch of foreigners at my table.
- [LAUGHTER] - Yep, finally ready to renounce free health care, economic prosperity, and diplomatic respect for Oh, God, maybe I didn't think this through.
And tomorrow I will be as American as El Pollo Loco.
Salud.
You can't drink.
You have a test tomorrow.
Ay, please.
In Cuba, we had the four "R" s.
Reading, writing, 'rithmetic and rum.
Plus you only need to get 60% right to pass.
So basically, to become an American, you have to prove you're a D-minus student.
Yep, it's the same requirement as it is to become president.
- [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] - [ELENA] That's weird.
[ALEX] What's wrong? Syd just sent me a text.
It's the dancing girl, salmon sushi and prayer hands.
Okay, don't panic.
Why would I panic? Now I'm panicking.
Relax.
When you get confusing emojis, you just need to send even more confusing emojis back until someone breaks.
You're in an intense game of emoji chicken.
Aw.
Poor Elena.
So hard being a teenager in a relationship.
Yeah, kids.
Take 'em or leave 'em, right? Seems to me like you kinda love kids.
These two, they're always at each other's throats.
Alex, you are the best.
Thank you so much.
You know how you sometimes have a great, healthy meal, and two hours later, you're over the toilet with fire shooting out both ends? That's my life right now.
So, Penelope, I'm sensing some stress.
Uh, you think, Pam? Yeah, I'm freaking stressed.
[LAUGHS] Everything was going so great with Max.
I mean, you should see this guy.
Imagine if Bradley Cooper was stuck in a gym for almost a year with nothing to eat but hotness pills.
Okay, yes.
Maybe if Bradley Cooper was stuck in a gym with Charlize Theron and Bradley Cooper left.
Yeah.
You hop up on a stool, you look him in the eye and you be tough.
Make him think you could burn down that garage, but you don't actually do it.
I wish somebody would've given me that advice.
If he breaks up with you because of that, that's on him.
He'll find someone else.
Does he like Korean barbecue? Sorry, super-duper Bradley Cooper, I'm only a human woman.
Well, of course, if we did have a baby, it would be like a tall me, so it'd be pretty hot.
- Pen - No.
I'm almost 40, okay? What am I going to do? Have one kid in college, one kid in high school, and one kid hanging off my boob? Honestly, these just started looking normal again.
There were a couple of years there where it was like [CLICKS TONGUE] And, you know, my mom's not getting any younger, and soon I'm gonna have to take care of her too.
No.
No.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Maybe you need to tell Max that you're making decisions that privilege self-care, even if that leads to a conscious uncoupling of your relationship.
What's that mean? You gotta throw truth at him, girl.
Even if he bails.
You're right.
I have to lay down the law.
Ugh.
- What am I thinking? A baby.
Smelly.
Loud.
- Mmm-mmm.
Drains all your life force away.
[CHUCKLES] - [ALL] Aw.
Congratulations.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Abuelita, you're still studying? Don't you know everything by now? Of course.
I'm just trying to avoid getting propositioned by all these guys.
The process is a breeze.
There is nothing to be nervous about.
[SCHNEIDER SIGHS] They didn't call my name yet, did they? What the hell are you wearing? I'm trying to look more American.
Is it not working? [SCOFFS] I should have brought a gun.
Drug, sobriety, vision, IQ, smog.
You name it, I fail it! Relax, pobrecito Schneider.
Look, look, look, you go in, they ask you a few questions, you come out.
Fricky-fracky.
American.
See? Oh, my God! They're gonna send me to Gitmo! Hi, folks.
I'm looking for Lydia Margarita Del Carmen Inclan Maribona Leytevidal de Riera.
Ooh, that's fun.
Listen up, people, because I'm only gonna say this once.
First name is a little, uh, smudged.
Uh, something Schneider? You'll do great.
Go get 'em.
[CHUCKLES] You like my outfit? [CHUCKLES] Oh, boy.
He's screwed.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss him.
Are you okay, Penelope? Yeah.
Oh.
We cannot make mistakes like that.
Now I have no pudding.
[SIGHS] I'm sorry.
I guess I've just been a little distracted.
What's up? Believe it or not, I've been thinking about having a baby.
[CHUCKLES] It's crazy, right? What do you think? I think I've never been so flattered.
I'll do it.
[LAUGHS] No, I am not talking about you, Doc.
I'm talking about Max.
Well, if that's the way you want to go.
But seriously, Doc, be honest.
Having a baby at my age, it's crazy, right? No, not at all.
I There is risk, but modern medicine has come a long way.
You're in great health.
With proper prenatal care, you could have babies for the next decade.
Look, you're gonna have to make up your mind, but if this is something you want to do with Max, you could.
Thanks a lot, Doc.
Now, when I come back after nine months with a healthy Latino Bradley Cooper baby, it'll be your fault.
All righty, your application looks complete.
Beautiful penmanship, by the way.
Thank you.
[CHUCKLES] When you are a dancer, even your fingers sashay.
I'm a dancer myself.
I can tell by the fire in your eyes.
It's my allergies, but thank you.
Why don't we do-si-do into your civics test? Okay.
Name three of the original 13 states.
Oh, I can name them all.
But I will go for my favorite three.
Eh, South Carolina, Georgia and Rhode Island.
[CHUCKLES] Where is the Statue of Liberty? New York.
Uh, but I'm guessing her butt's facing New Jersey.
[LAUGHS] I'm from New Jersey.
Great town.
[IN NEW JERSEY ACCENT] Forget about it.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Beautiful cat.
That's my daughter.
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Would your daughter like to go out sometime? Or is she an inside daughter? Have you ever been convicted of a crime? My beloved Berto and I once made love in the park.
Well, uh, that's certainly naughty.
A crime that no one saw us.
Have you ever been arrested? Does public nudity at a hockey game count? There is, uh, no mention of a public nudity charge in your file.
Oh, you just go to YouTube and type in "Zam-boner.
" Well, if it's not in here, we may need to re-run your background check.
Oh, no.
Are you in handcuffs? No, I passed! - Yay! - Congratulations! [SCHNEIDER LAUGHING] Please read the underlined words.
No problem.
[IN HEAVY ACCENT] "The fox is on the bitch.
That's what I said.
Mm-hmm.
Well, you are a delightful candidate for citizenship.
- Ooh.
- And friendship.
[GASPS] - [CHUCKLES] - So, let's just Oh.
That's interesting.
Everything about me is interesting.
Oh.
Okay.
In the, uh, waiting room? [CHUCKLES] Ooh, here comes Abuelita.
- Felicidades.
Muy bien hecho.
- All right! Way to go.
What? What? Is something wrong? I don't know.
He said to wait here.
She told me I passed in the room and then I showed her my YouTube video.
Don't look for it.
I answered every question.
I aced the English test.
Did I do something wrong? [ELENA SIGHS] This is because you're Latinx.
The white guy goes in there and cruises to citizenship, despite having nothing to offer this country.
That's right.
Wait, are you talking about me? Could I lose my green card? - [GASPS] - [ALEX] No.
You would not be the first proud immigrant who got treated like a criminal.
I cannot believe this.
It is this government today.
This whole country has changed.
It has turned to caca.
This has been my home for more than 50 years, and they don't want me? Well, I don't want them.
Oh, Lydia, sorry, we just had a typo in your social.
You passed.
[LYDIA CHUCKLES] [KNOCK AT DOOR] - Hey, Schneider.
- [SCHNEIDER] Hey.
Hey! Mami told me you somehow passed.
Congratulations! Oh, thanks.
Yeah, they didn't specifically ask if I got drunk and tried to ride a moose, so after that I was golden.
Hey, can we talk? [SIGHS] I need a man's perspective.
How important is having kids to you? Never really thought about it.
Then why are you holding one? Oh, this thing? [CHUCKLES] This is Mikey McGurb, the McGurbs' grandson.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Oh, it's my cousin Gordy.
He still thinks I'm full-on Canadian.
I gotta ease him into it.
Could you just - Oh, no.
Is he gonna be okay? - Oh, yeah.
You're all good.
- [BABY COOING] - [CHUCKLES] Gordo, ya hoser, how you doin', eh? [COOING] Babies are so stupid.
Why you so stupid, huh? - Hey.
Oh, yes.
Oh, my goodness.
You are pretty stinking cute.
All right, good news is Gordo bought it.
Bad news is I'm judging a poutine festival in Saskatoon next week.
[SIGHS] You okay? Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
It's just everything I've been going through with Max.
- [SIGHS] When I hold this little nugget in my arms, I think it's not so bad.
- In fact, it's kind of amazing.
[CHUCKLES] - [COOING] Wow.
Well I don't know what you want but I do know that if you choose to have another kid, you'll be incredible.
You're the single greatest mother I know.
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from a guy with five moms.
And thank you, Mikey McGurb.
[BABY COOING] [BOTH CHUCKLE] He likes you.
- Max, we need to talk.
- [SIGHS] I have been obsessing about something you said the other day.
Oh.
I just think Arby's is underrated.
Not the best, just solid.
No.
Not that.
I'm talking about when you said you wanted to have kids.
[CHUCKLES] I knew something was bothering you.
[SIGHS] I shouldn't have said anything.
We're so new and I didn't mean to freak you out.
I was just talking.
But you were serious? Well, yeah, I see myself becoming a dad someday, but it is way too early to have that conversation.
No, no.
See, that's the thing.
[SIGHS] I didn't know you were stressing about this.
I'm really sorry.
No.
I don't want you to be sorry.
Don't be sorry.
I get that you want kids.
It's a great thing, it's the best thing.
But I know that because I've already done it.
Uh, okay.
Yeah, no, I mean, no, I understand, you know.
Being a father was something I always wanted.
You know, babies and watch them grow up.
[GRUNTS SOFTLY] All those firsts.
But, hey, hey, hey, if it's a deal-breaker, I can let it go.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Really? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Yeah.
[SIGHS] Look, I just want to be with you.
Ah! Good, you are here.
[SING-SONG] I want to show you something.
Oh, great.
I guess Schneider told you that I was thinking of having a baby.
- What? - You're having a baby? No! I'm not having a baby.
I told Schneider that Max wanted kids, and obviously, Schneider told Abuelita because he's a chismosa at heart.
No, Schneider did not say a thing.
This is what I want to show you.
[EXCLAIMS] No, Mami, not happening.
Never say never, Lupe.
I said I would never be anything but Cuban, but here I am, Miss America.
[VOCALIZING "THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"] Okay.
Well, Mami, I am certain that I'm not having a baby with Max because we just broke up.
No.
[SIGHS] I knew he was too pretty to be straight.
Okay, we can salvage this.
It's my decision.
I know you guys really liked him, but it is for the best.
He wants kids and I've already had my kids.
Even though he says he's okay with that, I know down the road, he is gonna regret missing his chance to be a dad.
And I love him, and I don't want to deprive him of the experience because I know how amazing it is.
I'm sorry, Mami.
It sounds like you did the right thing.
Plus, the last time you had a baby, you got it right.
[CHUCKLES] I love you dopes.
[CHUCKLES] We love you too.
- Homework.
- [BOTH GROAN] You are making a mistake.
Mami, don't.
A good man is hard to find and you have found a good man.
Lupita, I have spent so many years alone.
It's not something you want.
I can take care of myself, okay? Yes, but you shouldn't have to.
I mean, mira, if down the road, Max wants a baby, pfft, y qué? A baby would be wonderful.
A gift from God.
I've got to do what's right for me.
If you love him, you can make it work.
How dare you say that? Come on.
This is the hardest decision I've made since I left Victor, and you're making it even harder.
Oh, you are just mad because you know I am right.
I am not just some pushy old lady.
- [SCOFFS] - And I know you.
I know you better than anyone on this Earth and I am telling you this is a mistake! Then it's my mistake to make! And it's not a mistake.
So you know what? If you've got any more advice, keep it to yourself, 'cause I don't want it.
Or anything else from you! Â¡Ya! Good night, Lupe.
Maybe you will have more sense in the morning.
[SPANISH SONG PLAYING] Mami, I got up early to get us pastelitos and coffee.
We gotta get going.
[SIGHS] Mami, whatever, we gotta get going, we have [GASPS] Mami! Mami!
[THEME SONG PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] - Hi.
Hey, Pen, I got Lydia's stuff you asked for.
Fuzzy Afghan she likes, picture of the Pope, picture of a different Pope, picture of your dad, picture of the family, picture of me with the family, picture of me by a waterfall.
I'm just gonna keep talking 'cause I'm not good in crisis situations.
This isn't a crisis.
Everybody, the surgery went well.
It prevented a stroke.
She's gonna wake up, right? Yes, of course.
But you know this woman can't be rushed.
My wedding started half an hour late because she needed to adjust her tiara.
Yes, she wore a tiara to my wedding.
She wanted to match a little figure of herself on the cake.
No.
Up, up, up, up.
There will be no crying.
She did once tell me tears are the pee-pee of the face.
- Good vibes only.
Okay? - [SIGHS] - Good vibes.
- Good vibes.
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Hi, Mami.
Look who's here.
Alex, put this on her.
These your kids? Oh, no.
These are children I picked up outside, so I can show them what a coma looks like.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Funny.
Did you know that your mom is also a nurse? I do.
She's only told me, like, a hundred times.
- This is running low.
- That's literally why I'm here.
That's why you brought a refill, right? I'll be right back.
I'll hang out with Abuelita.
Okay.
Okay, Abuelita.
It's only you and me now.
Just the way you like it.
[SIGHS] I know you haven't had time, but your nails are a disaster.
Don't worry.
I got you covered.
Mami, me, even Elena.
And, no, she didn't burst into flames.
I thought you'd like that one.
Anyway, Padre Jose did the homily.
And I actually learned something.
"To whom much has been given, much will be required.
" That's from Luke.
But it's also from Spider-Man.
I made sure to record El Amor y la Sangre.
You will not believe what Rosalita did to Maria Luisa.
No spoilers, but Francisco estÃ¡ vivo.
[VOCALIZES] [SIGHS] Okay, that's all I'm gonna give you.
Okay, I think we're good.
Te quiero, Abuelita.
I know you'll wake up soon.
[DOOR OPENS] Hi, Alex.
"Would you tell a rose to bloom faster?" [CHUCKLES] Oh, hi.
I'm a friend of the family.
Dr.
Leslie Berkowitz.
Oh, she has her own nurse, she has her own doctor.
Should I pull up a chair for her dentist? - Oh, hi, Doc.
- Hey.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Yeah.
TÃ­o Felix is on his way with sangria and a karaoke machine.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, okay, so this is probably a good time to tell you that visiting hours are almost over.
[LAUGHS] Okay.
Uh, this is probably a good time to tell you we're Cuban.
Great.
I am from Pittsburgh, but visiting hours are still almost over.
You don't get it, Nurse Wally.
And then we all got pink eye.
So that's what's up.
You got it? You're little, but I'm afraid of you.
Good.
I gotta prep this bed.
I am definitely not hiding.
Alex, come with me.
Elena said the cafeteria food is a conspiracy to keep people sick, so it's all aboard the Panda Express.
Oh.
Her nails are drying, so no hand-holding.
[SIGHS] I gotta say, Lydia, you even make a hospital gown seem glamorous.
But something is missing.
- Uh-huh.
- [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] There you go.
I'm so sorry this happened on your big day, Lydia.
Strange seeing you so still and quiet.
Everything is dramatic and exciting, and in a language I don't understand.
And I never want the show to end.
You are my favorite diva.
You make me feel like a young man of 45.
And I haven't felt 45 since I was 22.
So I don't care what we call our relationship or friendship or whatever.
My time with you is the only thing that makes me happy.
And I know that Berto is the love of your life.
I hope that's okay with you.
Oh, drat.
I've Yeah, yeah.
Messed up a nail.
Uh [EXHALES] Alex is gonna kill me.
We'll just hide this.
- [SIGHS] - [DOOR OPENS] I made it halfway to the restaurant.
I forgot my purse.
Stat! [SIGHS] Thank God she didn't wake up.
Isn't that what we want? [INHALES] She must never know.
I was talking to the head nurse.
She gave me all these treats after I gave her this treat.
Two could play at that game.
I'll just give her money.
[SIGHS] Elena, want some Jell-O? Jell-O is made from boiled down cow carcass.
Ooh.
[SIGHS] I'm no expert, uh, but I think we have another beauty emergency.
[SIGHS] Abuelita, I'm putting lipstick on you, so you might wanna wake up and see this.
Mejor.
[SIGHS] Did I ever tell you why I stopped speaking Spanish? One day, uh, you sent me to school in a puffy yellow dress with a big red bow in my hair.
I looked like Ms.
Pac-Man.
And so, at lunch, uh, I "accidentally" flushed that bow down the toilet.
Took two flushes to get it down.
[SIGHS] I mean, I heard you, I just didn't want to hear you.
[SIGHS] So, instead of answering back in Spanish, I just looked at you like And you started yelling at Mom.
[IMITATES LYDIA] "Your daughter cannot speak Spanish anymore.
She has lost her Cubanidad.
" [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So I had an out.
I pretend I can't speak Spanish, you ain't great at English.
It was perfect.
Except I screwed myself because I lost my Spanish.
[SNIFFLES] And you surprised me with your acceptance and your love and your support.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You even helped me get a girlfriend.
I know men love you, but you could crush it as a lesbian.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So now I feel stupid because all I wanna do is talk to you.
You're exactly who you are and you don't care if anyone gets it or not.
And you're loud and opinionated.
You always think you're right.
You are so stubborn.
[SNIFFLES] Because you're my hero.
Y te quiero.
[WALLY CRYING] I'm sorry.
[SNIFFLING] I kept trying to leave and then something emotional would happen.
And then something even more emotional would happen.
You guys are very emotional people.
In Pittsburgh, it's, "Steel Town, Steel Hearts.
" [CRYING] Oh, God.
I haven't cried since I was six and my rabbit Tupac died.
For years, all those tabloid headlines saying Tupac was alive just toyed with my emotions.
I brought some stuff to make it homier for her.
I'm gonna need ten minutes.
Oh, yeah, I should probably go anyway.
The guy in 404 has been waiting, like, an hour for a sponge bath.
He must be freezing.
[CRYING] Wow.
We'll go together when you're back on your feet.
It's so crazy how we're both immigrants.
I mean, I would never compare my story to yours, but the parallels are spooky.
You were 18, I was 18.
You left your family behind.
I left four step-families, a maid, a butler, a chauffeur, and a horse groomer who really got me.
[SIGHS] But Father was expanding his business to the US and so I had to go.
I remember, at the airport, I was crying.
You don't know how dirty a dirty look can get until you're crying for a whole plane ride and you're not a baby.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I really didn't wanna be in America.
So I drank.
And I recreated the snowy plains of Canada with cocaine.
[SIGHS] I'm told I attended classes at Pepperdine University, but I will have to take that on faith.
So, I'm in a detox center in El Segundo.
This was my fourth rehab.
My re-re-re-rehab.
[CHUCKLES] You told me, "You eat this, you get some sleep, and tomorrow, you try again.
" And then you tucked me in and kissed me good night on my forehead.
Forehead kisses are wildly underrated.
Just something really comforting about 'em.
Then again, it might just be you.
Dad never did that.
Or my horse groomer.
After I got out of rehab, I started hanging around your apartment a lot more, 'cause it helped.
'Cause now you're my family.
Don't worry.
I haven't legally changed my last name to Alvarez.
My lawyer said it was a whole thing, so Anyway, Pen said no crying, so I'm not gonna.
[SNIFFS] Actually, for once, I agree with Father.
Only losers cry.
And we're not losing anybody today.
Let's hit that oath ceremony soon, okay? Whoa.
But it's beautiful.
[KNOCK AT DOOR] Hola.
Okay, I'm gonna stay cool, but there's definitely an exorcist guy in here.
Hi, Padre.
He's just here to do last rites.
Yeah, no.
I gotta go.
[SCHNEIDER SIGHS] Look, I'm just having you do this because God forbid something happens and she doesn't get into heaven on a technicality.
Thank you.
Lydia, through this holy anointing, may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.
May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up.
Amen.
Wait.
There is one more thing.
Vicks VapoRub.
I blessed it.
Well, you must love this.
All these people coming in here, telling you how much they love you.
I mean, Schneider basically made you a stage.
You are the star of your coma, Mami.
But let me tell you something, viejita, I'm not part of this.
You're not getting a tearful bedside speech from me because I'm still mad about our fight last night.
I know you like to have the last word, but this is dramatic, even for you.
You can't have a stroke to win an argument, Mami.
[SIGHS] But you were being so you.
Then when you told me I was making a mistake breaking up with Max, I remembered another time you told me I was making a mistake.
It's when I enlisted in the army.
You remember that? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] We have had a lot of arguments, but that one is definitely in the top three.
Right after, "Don't get divorced," and, "Brown lipstick is for hoochies.
" Here is the most patriotic woman I know.
A woman who, every Fourth of July, makes us sing the national anthem while eating red, white, and blue flan.
Then, on my first day of basic training, Papi drove me to the airport alone, while you stayed home, pouting.
But I was leaving for boot camp, I was 18 and I was scared and you weren't there for me.
You know what pissed me off even more? Knowing your story about how, when you left Cuba, how your mami held your hand the whole car ride to the airport.
Kissed your forehead, and sang "Cielito Lindo" so you wouldn't feel afraid.
How you felt so loved.
Thank God that Papi was there for me, because you weren't.
I didn't know if what I was doing was right or not, joining the army, but guess what? It turned out to be very right.
Because I met Victor and I had those great kids.
And because I served, I get to go to school and live my dream.
Kind of the best decision I ever made in my freaking life.
And I did it without your blessing.
So I guess I didn't need your support then, and maybe I don't need it now.
[CRYING] Mami, please, wake up and argue with me.
Please, Mami.
I'm not ready.
Not yet.
[SIGHS] I'm not gonna say goodbye.
And I forgive you because now I'm afraid.
And I'm not gonna say goodbye.
But instead, what I'm gonna say is this.
You did a really good job being my mami.
And because of that, we're gonna be okay.
I love you so much.
But if you need to go, it's okay.
It's okay.
[GASPS] Ay, Berto.
- You really kept me waiting, mujer.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You know I cannot be rushed.
- Would you tell a rose to bloom faster? - [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] If I didn't know any better, I'd say you did this to remain a Cuban citizen until the end.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Are you suggesting that I am being - dramatic? - [CHUCKLES] - SÃ­, that is what I'm saying.
- [CHUCKLING] Lucky for you, I like it.
And I am not the only one.
- Tell me about this Dr.
But I like that you are jealous.
I am jealous, amor.
But I cannot blame this man for having excellent taste.
- [CHUCKLES] - Ay, mÃ­rala.
When she's sleeping, she still looks 12.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah, but I'm still mad at her.
Ay, mi vida, why? Because she had a good man and she let him go.
All about whether or not to have a baby.
[CHUCKLES] It's true.
Lupe said she was too old, but I would have had a baby with you at any age.
- Hmm.
- Fifty.
Sixty.
We could make a baby right now.
Don't tempt me.
Actually, if I remember correctly, I wanted to have many more babies, but you wanted to go back to dancing.
[CHUCKLES] Ay, Dios mÃ­o.
You have lived one hell of a life.
That's true.
And I managed to be glamorous to the end.
I knew I could do it! [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Fue maravilloso.
- Mmm.
[SIGHS] And now, Elena's going to be graduating from high school, then college, then graduate school, then a doctorate.
I just wish I could be there to say, "You can't go to school forever.
Ay, Dios mÃ­o, ese niÃ±o.
[SIGHS] He just gets me.
You are my soul mate, but he is my other half.
I will miss him getting married.
I would have looked so good on top of that wedding cake.
[SMACKS LIPS] Pero Lupe What's the matter? Are you worried she won't be okay without you? No, no.
That's just it.
Obviously, she will be devastated and her bereavement will be written about in the history books.
She is a spectacular mother and woman and nurse and fighter and healer.
Our daughter heals people, Berto.
And that is a tribute to your mothering, mi vida.
Yes.
My work here is done.
And let's be honest, God could use my help.
So, mi amor is it time? Not yet, mi vida.
Not yet.
Hello.
[LAUGHING] "I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
" Mai Ling.
Lydia Margarita Del Carmen Inclan Maribona Leytevidal de Riera.
- Yeah! - [CHEERING] AsÃ­! [LAUGHING] Dale, Abuelita, dale! Dale, Abuelita, dale! [VOCALIZING] - Dale, Abuelita, dale! - Ay! There are more people.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
James Rose.
She's dead.
Oh, my god, Mami.
That's terrible.
Who is she again? We can't remember either.
Okay, is she the tia that always wears yellow? That's tia Big Bird.
Is she the one that always finds new ways to insult you? Pfft! That's tia Bitchy.
So none of us can remember who she is? Oh, tia Ophelia.
What a tragedy.
Ophelia was the tia with the eye patch.
tia Jack Sparrow! Aha! I called her tia Blackbeard, but then that got confusing because we have another tia with an actual black beard.
[laughter] [Elena] Sorry.
At least we'll get to see the family at the funeral.
Everybody will be there.
Mimi, Maruchi, Rosita, Tio Juanito, Baby Juanito, and now his baby Gordito Juanito.
Aah! It'll be good to see everybody.
Except, of course, La Diabla.
Who Mami has been mad at for 20 years because of a stupid mantilla.
Mami, Mirtha said she doesn't have it.
- That's because - She's a liar.
But didn't you Rightfully accuse her of having it all these years? Because she does.
- Go comb your hair.
- I don't have to.
[groans] So, what's a mantilla? Is that like a trans-tia? No.
But I like that I'm in your head.
That is why we will never speak to Mirtha and her family ever again.
Right, Lupe? No.
This ends now.
As a matter of fact, I'm hosting the reception after the funeral here.
La Diabla at my house? She will never make it past that cross.
Mami, the only thing we're burying at this funeral is your feud and tia Amelia.
- [all] Ophelia.
- Aye! Whoever! [Lydia] How can you not take my side? Family is everything.
Come on.
This cost me my relationship with Estrellita.
[whispering] That's Mirtha's daughter, your mami's cousin.
She used to be my best friend.
She even taught me the entire choreography to Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation" video, which got me mad props in the Army.
I don't think those are Janet's moves.
Shut up.
We improvised.
Well, then you agree.
You don't want your name changed to tia Any-Day-Now.
- [theme song plays] This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [sobbing] Penelope, linda.
Hi, tia.
I see you're still enjoying your mother's tostones.
[chuckles] Hi, tia.
Hello, Elena.
Still just the one eyebrow? I guess that was tia Bitchy.
This funeral is like The Walking Dead of tias.
I mean Oh, oh, oh.
There's tia Pilar.
I've always wondered if she's gay.
Elena, you think everyone is gay.
Pilar is just eccentric.
She rides a motorcycle.
She owns seven cats.
Mami, what's that? All right.
Pilar is definitely gay, but nobody talks about it.
Everybody's like, "Well, you know Pilar.
She's just" - That is so offensive.
- It is? It is.
I'm woke.
This is ridiculous.
I'm just gonna ask Pilar if she's gay.
Like a lesbian Jesus? I love that.
Because I have long hair, and I'm a really good carpenter, and I look really good in Birkenstocks.
Hey, baby, nobody looks good in Birkenstocks.
Besides, it's none of our business, and it would be rude to ask, so don't.
- Okay? - Okay.
Looks like you need a man on the inside to get you intel on Pilar.
A double-o seis.
Double-o six? [counts in Spanish] Whatever! The point is, I know Spanish, but nobody expects it from Tio Handsome Gringo.
You are not fluent, Schneider.
Neither are you.
[gasps] [Lydia] There is my sister.
La Diabla herself.
With her lizard eyes, and her vulture claws, and her gray roots.
I am here.
Ophelia, you can now finally rest in peace.
I could take her.
[inhales deeply] I'm going in.
- Mirtha.
- Lydia.
- Estrellita.
- Hi.
[gasps] Oh, God! There's so much to catch up on.
I got divorced.
Stronger now.
What are you doing? Just rocking my natural curls.
You don't like it? No.
I mean talking to me.
We're not allowed.
- It's not safe.
- Okay.
It's okay.
I talked to Mami.
I don't know what just happened.
But, uh, this ends today.
We will be together again.
Don't make promises you can't keep.
And I love your curls.
Always have, always will.
[both sigh] [Penelope inhales sharply] Mami, I thought you said you were going to apologize to tia Mirtha.
Paciencia.
Hi, Pilar.
Elena.
How are you, honey? I'm gay.
I came out at my quinces.
Yeah, I know.
I was there.
I jump started your mom's car off my truck.
So, how's school? Well, as a gay student, it's going great.
So, how are you? Well, my aunt just died, so Right.
Right.
Right.
Oh, look, anyone else.
Poor Ophelia.
[mimics sobbing] I know, I know.
Oh, sequin eye patch.
Nice touch.
It's time to do what we talked about.
No! Please, there must be another way.
There is no other way.
Does anybody want to see pictures of me at Homecoming? Me and the Cuban girl who I will probably marry.
Don't touch the hair! She looks Puerto Rican.
[whispers] Mami.
You had the mantilla this whole time? No, she had it! Ay, Ophelia.
You were the only one who could ever truly see me.
Do you know[clears throat] she had her eyes on it for a long time until 1952, then she had her eye on it.
Ay, Lydia, all these years I blamed you.
Oh, and I blamed you for blaming me, but can you blame me? I would say I'm sorry, but I cannot without hearing our mami calling me weak from her grave.
Te quiero, Mami.
And I am sorry too, and I also will never say it out loud.
All is forgiven.
Hug it out, viejitas! [laughs] We're back! [cheering, laughing] Oh, my God! There's so much to talk about! Cage started a new school, magnet.
Dead tooth, fixed.
So, now I'm rocking my natural curly too.
Oh, God! - I missed this so much.
- Me too.
What are you doing? Obviously, we don't want the mantilla to go down in the dirt with Ophelia.
- You're right.
- Yeah.
Our great-grandmother got married and executed in it.
That was quite a quinces.
Everyone speaks Spanish so much faster than on my tapes.
[Elena sighs] I did hear something about Pilar moving to Tampa though.
What? No! She's probably moving because the family doesn't accept her.
I have to do something about it.
She's the only other gay in the family.
Elena, can I borrow your ChapStick? Pero if it's not Fenty by Rihanna, then I don't even want to look at it.
Not now, Flavio.
[huffs] We might be Cuban, but we're still citizens of the Rhythm Nation.
We didn't always nail it, but we could sell it with confident face.
Also the face we used to sneak into R-rated movies.
- Do you remember what happens after this? - We steal wine coolers from our parents and kiss magazine pictures of Leonardo DiCaprio.
- Yeah! - [laughs] I forgot how much fun we had together.
Best years of my life.
You know, I still have all the letters your wrote me while I was in the Army.
- You do? - Yeah.
'Cause they mean a lot.
I can't believe I have my best friend back.
Me too.
I was in the hospital for a week.
Ay, Mami, I can't tell you how happy I am that our family is back together again.
I want to kill Mirtha.
She's bragging about her little cancer scare.
Cancer is scary, Mami.
Oh, it was nothing.
And then I told God, "I would rather die than lose my beautiful locks," and God said, "Nobody knows this, Mirtha, but on the seventh day, I wasn't resting, I was creating your hair.
" And the next day, the cancer was gone.
[all gasp] The nerve of her making a big deal of her cancer.
I had a stroke! Well, Mami, you could tell people if you wanted.
Never.
I would not be caught dead having a stroke.
Pero Mirtha Oh, Mirtha needs all this attention.
I'm surprised she's not singing.
She sings like a donkey.
Un cocotazo.
Mami, no! Mami, no! Lydia, won't you join me in this song? Well, I don't know if I can sing as beautifully as you do.
Ave MariaÂ  Gratia plenaÂ  Hi! [tongue clicks] Really don't pick up on social cues, do you? So, I wanted to apologize for earlier because I was going on and on about myself, when really I'd like to know more about you.
You and Susan.
You have been friends for a long time.
Are you thinking you might do, like, a friendship ceremony sometime soon? Maybe you can have something old, something new, something borrowed, and something flannel? What are you getting at, Elena? Okay, so I just feel like maybe you can't live your life as who you really are because you're afraid of what the family might think.
Am I right? Okay, I have been hiding something.
What? How are you Jewish? I converted for my wife, Susan.
Oh! I see what you did there! You got lesbian jokes! No, but really.
I'm so excited that we can talk about this.
And I'm so sorry that you've had to keep being gay a secret for so long.
Oh, it's not a secret.
I'm out to the family.
It just does not stick.
[sighs] My mom keeps telling them I'm afraid of men because I was attacked by a man in college.
It was not a man.
It was a squirrel, and it was female.
Okay.
So your mom needs to stop making up these stories.
You should go out there right now and come out to the entire family.
Make them accept it.
Elena.
[chuckles] Mira, these viejitas, they're not gonna change.
Look, I know how being gay goes, right? When you first start to figure it out, it's like, "Oh, no, I might be gay.
" And then it's like, "Oh, I'm gay.
" And then it's like, gay, gay, gay! Rainbow underwear! But eventually, you realize you're just a person, and it's really empowering not to have to be defined by who you want to make out with.
Oh, wow.
I might be the lesbian Jesus but you're a lesbian God.
[sighs] Yes, I have been called that before.
[both laugh] Well, I don't want to lose touch with you when you move to Tampa.
I'm not moving to Tampa.
Ave MariaÂ  [all cheering, clapping] Oh! I am so happy that stupid mantilla crap is behind us.
- Right? - Yes.
Where is it anyway? It's in Mami's bag.
Don't worry, we'll keep it safe.
Oh, you know what? We can just take it.
I didn't have it at my wedding and I'd love to get mine and Juan's name stitched in it.
Oh, okay.
And then you'll just give it back after? Oh, are you getting remarried? I mean I could [chuckles] but my kids are the oldest and the next in line to get married, so it just kind of makes sense.
Make me, tia Gray Tooth.
- [gasps] I got it fixed! - It doesn't match.
- I got it.
- You better give that back! No, never! I am getting mine and Juan's names on here, and taking yours and Victor's off! - What? - She couldn't keep him tied down.
Why should the mantilla? Oh! Oh, that was nasty! Te la juro! You know what? Monica is no longer tia Bitchy.
You are.
Ha! Who calls me tia Bitchy? Tell her to let go.
That mantilla belongs to us.
I meant I had a stroke of genius.
Mami, there are no names stitched on here.
No.
[gasps] This is not a mantilla.
She's right! This is just some random piece of lace.
So, you stuffed some worthless piece of caca into the casket with Ophelia? You knew? Of course, I knew.
No one gets buried with a mantilla.
We're Cubans, not ancient Egyptians.
How dare you call me mentirosa when you walk around acting like that is your hair color? [gasps] Oh! Well, at least I can still salsa without breaking a hip.
Well, I'll admit that you are light on your hooves.
But I would like to show you what that step looks like when you don't have feet like a chupacabra.
[vocalizes merengue music] Eso! Just admit you have the mantilla.
Wait.
The mantilla is what you all have been fighting about? Yes! I have it.
Susan and I used it at our wedding.
You were all there.
We should all be ashamed of ourselves.
Look at what this has done to us.
Mami, you lost your sister.
I lost my best friend.
Yeah, Lupe is right.
I have missed you, Mirtha.
I've missed you too, mi hermana.
I was in a coma because I had a stroke.
Ay, pucha! I'm so glad you're okay.
Let's put this all behind us.
Who knows how much time we have left? After all, I had cancer.
You are right.
Even though a coma beats cancer.
[Lydia sniffs] If there's one thing we can take from Ophelia's death is that life is too short.
We shouldn't spend it fighting.
Yeah, we're gonna have differences, but what does that matter? We're family.
[indistinct chattering] I am so glad we're good again.
Promise me that we'll keep in touch.
Of course, because we love each other too much to let anything get in between us again.
I wanna make a toast.
[Penelope chuckles] To Ophelia.
At least she got to see our President make America great again.
I'm sorry.
What? [theme music playing]
Why don't we make it a goal to see the sun today? Go down to the lake, get in a leaky paddle boat, make out with your girlfriend.
Whoa, what'd I say? Is paddle boat insensitive to motor boats or something? I can't keep up.
No, it's just, we're not calling Syd my girlfriend anymore.
To be clear, Elena's okay with me calling her my girlfriend.
- I like hearing it.
- I like saying it.
Focus.
Since Syd identifies as non-binary I want to call them by a term that's more acceptable and inclusive.
Nope, you gotta reel that in.
Oh, you know what I always thought was so cute? "Better half.
" I don't wanna call Syd half a person.
[gasps] What if I tell people you're my better whole? You're not saying that.
Don't you have anything better to do than sit around and think of names to call each other? Alright, I've been brainstorming names all night.
"Main Squeeze," "Person Friend," "Your Gay of Sunshine.
" Schneider, we didn't ask for your help.
In fact, we specifically said, "Do not help us.
It's like when people call themselves woke.
But I am woke.
I'm wide awoke.
Let me just bounce some ideas off ya.
- "Partners"? - We're not lawyers.
- "Lovers"? - We're not gross.
"Longtime Companion"? We're not two 70-year-old men suing each other over the custody of a bulldog.
Can't you do this somewhere else? Alex took his girlfriend to the museum.
Oh, It's probably on his Finsta.
Your favorite book is Chamber of Secrets.
Why can't you keep them? - What's Finsta? - I don't know.
- Yes, you do.
- Okay.
So everyone has a public Instagram where they post pictures with their mom and sunsets and other pretend nice crap.
And then they have a secret Instagram for their friends, a Finsta, where they live their real lives.
How did I not know about this? I have a F-Linked-In, a F-witter and a F-Facebook.
You said a lot of words that sound fake.
But okay.
It's not fake, and it is way hot.
[chuckles] My Finsta is exclusively my chinchilla in drag.
I am requesting to follow.
- Well, what's Alex's? - I don't know.
It's a private account.
Private? Pfft! There's no privacy here.
Fine, I will show you my Finsta.
Girl, I don't care about your nerdy crap.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [Dr.
Berkowitz] Hey.
I get why you're wound up.
But kids, they keep secrets from their parents.
That's how it is.
My daughter got married.
Well, my kids don't keep secrets from me.
Supposedly, Alex is at the museum with Chloe to see the Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit, - but who knows? - Yeah, he's there.
It's all over his Finsta.
He lets you follow him? Yeah, we're co-workers, and bros.
Bro-workers.
Show me.
- Sorry, bro-workers before - Give me that! Oh, okay.
It's mostly pictures of sneakers he can't afford.
Nice pull, Alex.
Really? You're saying that about a 15-year-old girl? [sighs] I guess not.
And I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable in a work setting.
What's with him? We took that sexual harassment seminar.
And I'm putting all I learned into action.
You probably noticed how I've tamped down my toxic masculinity.
It's been refreshing.
Yep, me and Doc both learned that we can never say anything nice about any woman's body ever again.
Ah, yeah.
That was a good one.
[laughs] Comments like that are definitely inappropriate, and it goes both ways, which is why I started wearing an undershirt.
Which is ridiculous, Doc, because you have a rockin' bod.
Thank you.
Wait.
No, thank you.
What kind of janky-ass seminar was this? All I know is I feel for Alex.
" [phone dings] AhOh.
Another pic of Alex and Chloe.
"I got hoes in different area codes.
" Well, that's not good.
Yeah, your long distance bill is going to be nuts.
Well, I don't love his language, but Whatever.
He's trying to be cool for his friends.
It must be so hard to be a mom of a teenage boy right now.
It's not hard.
That's what she said.
No, the woman at the seminar.
Come on! Well, I just wish I had some parental guidance about how to talk to women.
I learned everything on the streets.
I remember once a bunch of us went out and the guys were chatting up the gals and they were so confident.
And I didn't know how to be that way.
And finally, I just said, "Leslie, let's do this.
You grew out of that nonsense.
This was last month.
The bar scene can be tough.
I was at synagogue.
[phone dings] Okay.
Alex posing with a statue, and honking its boob.
Oh, man, that's not cool.
That statue doesn't even have arms to push him away.
[laughs] Like.
Syd's your "Queer Dear.
" [both] No.
Your "Non Bino-saur.
" [both] No! Your "Mighty Morphin Power Ganger.
" Ugh, it's too '90s.
That's your problem with it? Hi, Mami.
How was your day? Great.
Oh, and Alex is a perv.
Que? What are you talking about? Check out his Finsta.
How did you get into it? I took Scott's phone, I think it gave me HPV.
Look at Alex's post.
[all gasp] Alex! He's pretending his water bottle is his dingle.
[chuckles] That kid isa filthy monster.
I can't believe my own brother has such disrespect for women.
And the planet! I mean, a plastic water bottle? He should be using a reusable dingle.
Well, I had a wonderful time at the museum exposing myself to art.
I saw your Finsta.
What? But Scott told me bro-workers before Nope! Look, it's not a big deal.
Everybody has one of those.
Does everyone post pictures of themselves running around like a goose honking everything in sight? What? Honking boobs! Alex, Alex, Alex.
I mean Tweaking tatas.
Fondling fun bags.
Grabbing gazungas.
Well, it's not cute, Alex.
Especially how you were treating Chloe.
She is right, Papito.
I have taught you better manners than that.
Actually, I taught you better manners than that.
Because I taught you better manners than that.
Pero in this case, I feel responsible.
Because I am the reason that he got the date with Chloe in the first place.
But What did I tell you? I said, "You keep trying.
Wear her down.
Don't take no for an answer.
" And ticky-tocky, now he has a girlfriend.
Mami, you literally told Alex no means yes? Oh, no, no.
What I said was, "Every no is a yes in disguise.
" Oh, my god.
Abuelita, you are an enabler of toxic masculinity.
No, it's how society has encouraged men to define their maleness as being aggressive, unemotional, sex-obsessed.
You're just describing a man.
Mami, maybe in your day, but times change.
Men need to be careful about how they talk to women, or else they'll get in trouble.
Oh, poor men! "Now I can't yell from a passing car that I think a woman has sweet tatas.
" I know, it's a shame.
In my day, when I walked down the street, I would hear a symphony of compliments.
You were being harassed.
Mami, maybe you're comfortable with that type of attention but not everyone is.
You know what, then they are crazy.
Women want to be wooed.
Like you TÃ­a Mimi.
Well, when she met your TÃ­o Rico, she did not like him because he was feÃ­to.
But Rico was not stopped by his unfortunate face.
You see, he had a beautiful farm.
And one night, he broke into Mimi's room, and blindfolded her and they went for a "drive.
Pfft! Anton says Rico took off her blindfold, and she swooned.
Because it was dark and it was working for him.
And then Rico says, "This can all be yours.
Mimi.
Will you be mine?" And ticky-tocky, they've been married ever since.
That is romance.
That is the plot of Taken 2.
And "ticky-tocky" seems to smooth over some really horrifying things.
Oh, boy.
Women are beautiful.
The curve of their neck, the way that they move, everything.
Preach! That's why I'm an ally.
No means no.
Yes means yes.
But it's more complicated than that, Schneider.
It can't just be a yes.
We will show you.
- Mom, can I please go to my room now? - No, honey.
I think it's important that you watch this.
Really? Syd, may I place my hand on your shoulder? Yes.
May I place my hand on your waist? Yes! Oh, boy, I can feel the heats.
May I lovingly caress the slope of your cheek because it feels like home? Come on.
Is this really what the kids do? - Yes! - No one's ever done that.
Be real, this is how your first kiss went? Oh, no, not at all, this one just went for it.
I remember she pulled that Doctor Who scarf around my neck.
- Okay, Syd.
- Kinda chocked me actually.
- Okay.
- The cops had to break us up.
Okay! I gotta admit, I'm getting kind of confused.
Oh, my god, me too.
What if someone says, "I am not sleeping with you tonight?" And then an hour later, they're like, "Eh, fine.
- Now I'm really confused.
- I know.
It's confusing.
I hate to admit it, but I feel sorry for men.
This consent thing is tricky.
No.
Women always blame themselves, and then the man never has to take responsibility.
During rape prevention week at school, all the signs are aimed at women.
" How about, "Hey, guys, don't rape.
" Oh, my god, why are we talking about that? I took a couple pictures as a joke and Chloe thought it was funny.
Did she? Or did she feel like she had to laugh, 'cause she don't know what else to do with your hand on her boob? - Okay, Elena, take it easy.
- No.
He thinks what he did is cute.
You are basically a predator.
You're basically a psycho.
Wow, you too.
A couple of weeks ago, Syd and I were coming home from the movies on the bus, and we were holding hands.
And we noticed these guys staring at us, and then we got off the bus and they followed us.
What? Yes.
And they were going, "Come on, you guys, kiss.
We really wanna see it.
Just kiss.
" They thought that was really funny, too.
It was actually really scary.
Since then we've just stayed here.
Which is such a bummer.
Because it felt so good to be out as a couple and we had such a good day.
Elena, I'm sorry.
That sucks.
- I freaking want to kill those guys.
- No.
I don't want you to bloody your beautiful hands.
I didn't say anything.
Baby, you did the right thing.
In situations like that, you just have to keep yourself safe.
I know, but still.
I mean, you would never put up with that, Mom.
Well When I was in the Army I had a mentor and he was my first sergeant.
He thought I was a great medic and he took me under his wing.
He assigned me to a trauma room in a tactical field hospital and that was a big step for me, and I really wanted to make him proud.
He said "We should have a drink.
We've been working so hard.
" And he said how it felt right the two of us together.
And inside, I was like, "What?" I mean, this guy was like my work dad and I didn't know what to do.
Then he got close to me.
He grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch.
Oh, my god, Mom.
Well, you know me.
Dang, Mami don't play.
AssÃ­, right in the aguacates.
Mami, please tell me that guy got kicked out of the Army.
I wish.
My platoon sergeant offered to file a complaint, but he was honest.
It would take forever.
Plus, honestly, I didn't want people to know.
Because then that's all they know and that defines you.
But I was scared.
So I said nothing.
Lupita, honey, don't feel bad.
You got through it because you are strong.
Yeah, but I still feel guilty about it.
See, this is the problem.
If you don't say something, you carry it around inside.
If you do say something, you carry it around outside.
And maybe you want to put all that righteous anger into becoming a lawyer.
That's all I'm saying.
You would rock a pantsuit in a courtroom, is all I'm saying.
Part of me doing better is making sure you have it better.
Making sure you do better.
And you a little less ticky-tocky.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I don't want to make anybody feel the way those dumbasses made you feel.
It's okay, Alex.
I know you're a good guy.
Yes, you are.
Just remember there's a heart behind that boob.
Got it.
Who wants chicken boobs for dinner? Sorry, wrong crowd.
Well, I just got done calling all my exes.
I can report that all of my romantic moves have been 100 percent consensual.
Oh, Schneider, you didn't have to call anyone for that, we're right downstairs.
Would it cheer you up to know that we found the perfect relationship name? "Nerds"? It's flattering, it's non-gendered, and it's fun to say.
Syd is my SO.
"Significant Other.
" Or are they your "Syd-nificant Other"? Oh, my god! That's genius! Hey, girlfriend, wanna go out somewhere? Hell, yeah, Syd-nificant Other.
Yay, they're going outside! Hey, wait, is there something you guys wanna call me? Starts with an A.
Don't say the first thing you thought of.
[mambo music plays] Abuelita! No dancing! You heard what the doctor said.
Sit your crazy fondo down or you're gonna die.
I don't trust that doctor.
The first thing she did was weigh me, and after that everything she said was clouded by jealousy.
Abuelita, you are on blood thinners and you need to start using your cane to walk.
Why should I have to use a cane when I am so able? [chuckles] Read the Bible.
I'm serious.
I want to see you using that cane.
Okay.
Ame.
[mambo music plays] Don't enable this! You're lucky I talked her out of the fishnets.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Auction item number 32.
Spa in a box.
Hmm.
Two soaps and a bottle ofÂ rosÃ©.
Somebody's gonna be a real clean drunk.
Maybe me.
It's the third year in a row of us doing all the work setting up this fundraiser.
Oh.
What's the traditional gift for that? Do not sayÂ vaginal rejuvenation.
[women laughing] You know, this would go a lot faster if we were getting any help from the Sisterhood of the TravelingÂ Implants.
I'm just gonna say it.
I miss Matt Lauer.
Hey.
What's up, ladies? We are so close to finishing up.
And if you could grab ten baskets, we could be done in like one minute.
[clears throat] See, I can do math too.
Nikki, are you eating an auction item? Relax, Penelope, they're gluten-free.
Anyway, I wish we could help, but we're on our way to the gym.
Hmm.
This is a gym.
Yeah, and lifting baskets can be your workout.
[laughs] No, it's not an arms day.
[in Spanish]Â The maid is at the house with a body.
The woman is crazy.
[chuckles] You two are so cute, with your secret language.
You sign her up for the pervy dog, I'll put her down for the vag tune-up.
Abuelita, if you are gonna do laundry, you need to use your cane.
You are right.
Can you hold it a little higher? Abuelita, you can fight this all you want, but I'm not letting up.
Schneider's in thereÂ installing a bar in the tub as we speak.
Not that kind of bar.
Hey! Hey! Hey! So youÂ can avoid repetitive stress, I put your curtains on remote control.
[motor whirs] You should have let me die.
Okay, I installed the shower bar.
- I'll straighten it later.
- Appreciate that.
And then, oh, my god [laughs] Mateo did this funny Nikki impersonation.
"Hi, I'm Nikki.
Enough about Mateo already.
Just admit it, you like him.
Yeah, of course.
He's my buddy.
No, but you like him.
You guys should have seen her, smiling and laughing.
Ooh! So, you're crushing on a DILF, eh? You want me to talk to him? DILF to DILF? You're not a dad.
And you're definitely not an ILF.
Oh, that thing you do every year where Nikki outbids everyone, and you two go home together? That only happened three years in a row.
This year is different because I know better.
Nikki's toxic, and after spendingÂ time with her I always feel like I'm drowning in shame.
Yeah, you're going home with Nikki.
[sighs] I know.
So? What's wrong with this Mateo? Nothing, he's just not my type.
He's nice.
He's kind of a dork.
- Ay.
- No.
[chuckles] It's fine.
It's just I like a guy who can handle his business.
Someone who can take charge when I need him to.
And look, he just doesn't give me that [groans] - Mom, no! - Stop it! I get it.
I would look across the room at your father and I would go [groans] No! Stop making sounds and moving! No, it's a feeling you get in your stomach.
It's deep, it's physical, and once you feel it you can't ignore it.
Anyway, Mateo and me, no, - never gonna happen.
- Yeah.
You're in the friend zone anyway.
Can't crawl out of that.
Oh, I could if I wanted to.
I have a foolproof move I've been using since high school.
Spill a little liquid on the girls, then suddenly my eyes are no longer up here.
[chuckles] There's this kid in my class, Joe Kamacho, who has to wear a hearing aid.
I need them for the auction tomorrow.
I took them.
You can't wear high heels anymore.
Excuse me? The doctor was very clear.
You are on blood thinners, you are prone to dizzy spells, so you can't wear high heels anymore, y ya! You do not "y ya" me.
I "y ya" you.
Y ya! [motor whirs] Thank you for wearing flats, and thank youÂ for agreeing to auction off knitting lessons instead of dance lessons.
And thank you for always knowing what everybody else should do.
B.
you only come up to his armpit.
Yet she still looks down on me.
- And you love it.
- I do.
Okay.
Ah, the library is only open for one more hour, and I feelÂ the need, the need to read.
What a novel idea.
I thought Elena hid all of your heels.
No, these are my emergency heels.
My abuela taught me to keep a pair in the freezer in case of fire, flood, or flamenco.
Oh, still cold.
Elena is going to see you in these shoes.
Not if I stand behind my table.
And, Leslie, snitches get stitches.
But she's going to see that you're taller than my armpit.
- Look at you.
- Look at you! You ditched the cargo shorts, huh? Yeah, I'm trying to dress better.
My son said I look like a dork, who no one would ever date.
What? I unloaded all the heat lamps in the parking lot, okay? The parking lot? No, we need them on the quad like an hour ago.
Sorry.
Hang on.
Stu? Here's what gonna happen.
You're gonna move them on to the quad, and because you were late, you're gonna take another 20 percent off.
Sorry, sir.
I'll take care of it.
What? Nothing.
Oops.
What up, klutz? Here's a napkin.
Hey, Pete.
What the hell, guys? Hi, Schneider.
No.
Okay.
While I appreciate your business, this year, can we give a chance to someone who wants me for what's in my tool belt and not Well, this metaphor's not working out.
Just don't bid.
Oops, too late.
That's just a drawing of a This is a school! [typewriter dings] [keys clack] Is that a Remington Deluxe Model 5? Good ear.
His name's Belmondo.
That's crazy.
I have a hammer named Lorenzo.
And I am Lorenzo's colleague, Schneider.
Avery.
So are you a parent or a teacher or a student? Please don't say student.
Well, I'm I teach kindergarten.
But really I'm a poet.
I'm selling custom poems.
No kidding.
I type them onto paper I make at home from recycled phone books.
- How's business? - Not great.
Oh, a customer! Catch you later, neighbor.
Hi.
Did I eat soft cheese? Let's see how many bids we have, huh? - Ay.
- Oh, sugar.
These boots were not made for walking.
Leslie, back to the corral! Elena's coming.
Dr.
You're not some kid at the Havana club anymore, you're an old woman.
And you think an old woman could do this? [vocalizes in rhythm] Woo! Fine.
Clearly you don't care what Mom or me or the doctor says.
I give up.
That was very impressive.
Most women your age would have twisted an ankle.
[hoarsely] I did.
[groans] [clears throat] Is Belmondo acting up? Sure is.
Let me take a look.
You're really good with those tools.
Oh, thanks.
I like pretty much anything mechanical.
To me, all these gears, springs, and levers working in unison is like poetry, you know? I do.
Plus, with a typewriter, you can create something that lasts forever.
Something permanent you can you can hold and cherish.
[typewriter dings] Belmondo is fixed.
You win.
You're free to make your own choices about your health, even if those choices are stupid and can put you back in aÂ coma.
You finally get it.
[winces] [chuckles] Interesting items.
Abuelita.
Did you hurt yourself? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm simply interested in vaginal I hurt my ankle.
Okay.
Can you please give us a hand? We need to get her to the car.
Of course.
[yells] [Dr.
Berkowitz] I might need some help as well.
I've been outbid.
You have? By who? By me.
Well, I have a tradition to maintain, so Well, I'm not much for tradition, so I've had this dream.
This is getting boring.
Will you excuse me for one second? Yeah.
No, Nikki.
No, no, no.
I'm breaking this cycle, this dance of death that we do.
I know Avery and I just met, but she's making me feel things that I've never feltÂ before.
Okay, bring her.
Really? No, no, no, no! [exclaims] [clears throat] So Um, did you really mean what you said about me? Yeah.
I had a really nice time meeting you and Belmondo tonight.
Oh.
This is really experimental.
[chuckles] That's my phone number.
Got ya.
Thanks.
I will be calling.
Wow, it's justit's so refreshing to meet someone at one of these things that isn't a a privileged, rich, trust-fund baby.
We are so on the same page.
[both] Woo-woo! Yeah, we did such a great job that Nikki will take all the credit for it at theÂ PTA meeting.
Hey, you know what? I was thinking that you and me, we should go out sometime.
Go out? Yeah, you know, grab a drink, see a movie.
Call the heat lamp company, start yelling.
I don't know, date stuff.
Um I don't think we should.
Okay.
I mean, you're the only parent here I actually like.
- Right? - Right, yeah.
Then we'd be stuck with each other for four more awkward years.
Yeah, no, totally.
But I am so flattered.
- 'Cause you - Yeah, I know, all good.
I hope I didn't make it weird.
No, come on, no.
All good.
Thank you.
Now can we talk about getting rid of the high heels? - [sighs] - Elena, please, give the woman a moment's peace.
I'm just used to taking her side.
I don't even know what you guys are talking about.
Abuelita please.
I haven't slept since I saw you lying in that hospital bed.
I am so worried that something is going to happen to you, and you're beingÂ stubborn about a silly pair of shoes.
Mija.
I want to be who I am.
My abuela, Maria Luisa.
She wore her four-inch ruby stilettos everywhere, even snorkeling.
Oh, boy, she was a strong woman.
And she remained elegant.
In spite of living in the world that was not always beautiful.
And she was who she was.
Until the day she died.
So do you think that she can be who she is in a slightly lower heel? For me? For you? Maybe she could try.
If the shoes are sufficiently stylish, with a little platform, and a bit of sparkle.
Deal.
Okay.
And you know, maybe sometimes you can use the cane.
- Take theÂ win.
- Okay.
I want to make an announcement.
So what's your announcement? I realize that there are many things I still want to do with my life.
So I made a bouquet list.
Do you mean a bucket list? No, that makes no sense.
It is a bouquet list because it is an arrangement of all of the beautiful things you still want to do before you kick the bucket.
What'd you put on it? To sing in front of a big band again, hold myÂ grandchildren's children, have someone explainÂ Star Wars to me.
Okay.
"A long time ago - in a galaxy far, far away" - Check.
Done.
I remember.
I said I wanted to protect the friendship.
Yeah, that happened like an hour ago.
I remember stuff, I'm not freaking Memento.
I actually don't want to be friends with you.
Okay, well, that could have been an email.
Sorry.
I'm not great at this.
Huh! Interesting.
Go on.
And then you asked me out and I panicked.
I mean, I haven't been on a date since I split with my wife.
Mateo Are you asking me on a date? I am.
I actually started thinking about it and I don't think it's a good idea.
Remember five seconds ago when you asked me out, I said no, but I meant to say yes? [Lydia] Stop toying with the man! Invite him in so he can see what you will look like in ten years! [theme music plays]
Man, I'm so jealous.
It's called a "suite.
" Fool, I've seen Basketball Wives, I know what a suite is.
- We never go on vacation.
- Oh, yes, we do.
You just don't know because last time we went, you were too young to form memories.
Where do you think your Mickey Mouse ears came from? The Dollar Store.
They're not even Mickey Mouse, they're Ricky Rat.
Can you whine about your sad little life somewhere else? I'm doing my SAT prep.
That's three words, dingus! Hey! Can I have five minutes of peace with you two? It is true.
Those two have been fighting a lot.
Elena, stop it.
Maybe we do need a little R&R.
Oh.
Oye.
Why don't we go visit your brother in Seattle? It is on my bouquet list.
Mami, Tito travels for a living.
Oh, right, that was everybody but him.
You are always so hard on him.
Mami, whatever.
I get it.
- He's the boy.
He can do no wrong.
- Ugh! You really embrace that Cuban stereotype.
That's why Tito he is.
Where would we even go on vacation? Tito has been helping open restaurants all over the world.
He could make sure that we have an amazing vacation.
Well, guess what? So can I.
Pack your bags, people, we are going on vacation.
It's gonna be great, and it's gonna bring us closer than ever.
- [shouts] Move over! - You move over! [yells] [cars honk] This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [cars honk] Lupe I think we should have taken another way to San Diego.
Really, Mami? Because I picked this route just so we can sit next to the power plant that looks like a boobs for half an hour! It's okay.
It's all gonna be worth it.
Oh.
Sorry.
Callow.
"Juvenile and immature.
" And look, it's a picture of you.
Elena, stop reading in the car, you know it makes youÂ nauseous.
[car honks] Oh, please, sir, just go right ahead.
Oh, I'm on the shoulder.
Planes are the trash cans of the sky.
Everybody knows this.
Mami, I don't feel so good.
[chuckles] Mami, it's not funny.
I know, but when Elena throws up she makes the funny sound.
Like a sad foghorn.
[vomits like a foghorn] I'm sorry, baby.
Like a drunken moose.
Hello, Schneider.
Lydia asked me to water her plant.
Oh! [chuckles] She must've not known that Pen asked me to do it.
Don't worry, I got this.
No, no.
No inconvenience.
Don't you live in Encino? Just a 55-minute drive each way.
I don't mind.
But I have nothing else in my life! [sprays] [sighs] Well, we did that.
I should probably be getting to the rest of my day.
Yeah.
Time for me to go home.
Alone.
Sit in the dark.
And weep into my body pillow.
You know if you leave now, you'll probably be hitting some crazy traffic.
[Schneider] Oh.
We should just eat.
There's a great new Italian place around the corner.
Or We could just stay here and cook.
Yes! Ah! Que damn fancy.
They even spell motel with an H.
Mom, how can we afford this? You don'tÂ need money when you know how to play the game.
I put together a combo of my student ID, USAA, and AAA discount.
We have a view of the pool.
Dang, that's a lot of bikinis.
Don't forget the talk we had about respecting women.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's hearts behind the boobs.
Those are some big hearts.
My vacation is already bringing you two together.
Okay, that's enough.
A Bible? - And you arranged for this.
- Yeah.
She don't know.
Alright, let's grab some snacks and go down to the pool.
Oh, the children already drank their sodas on the way here.
Well, no problem.
We'll just grab some from the minibar.
[all gasp] Mom, you said minibars were introduced by the CIA to punish poor people.
Oh, and while we're here, you two are 12-year-old twins.
And I will not claim I'm a senior citizen.
No one will believe it.
- You don't have to 'cause you're not here.
- Huh? It was cheaper to say it's just me and the kids.
- They probably won't come up.
- [knock on door] Mami get in the closet! [Elena gasps] Act like twins! Tito.
LlegÃ³ la fiesta.
- Hey, TÃ­o.
- Alex, wassup? Buh-buh-buh-bup.
Wait for it.
Ba-bam! Ba-bam! - Love you.
- Thanks, TÃ­o.
Love you.
Mami, you can come out.
It's Tito.
[laughs] Ah.
[smooches] ["You Make My Dreams" plays] You make my dreams come trueÂ  You, ooh, oohÂ  YouÂ  Well, well, well, youÂ  Oh, yeah You make my dreams come true You, ooh, oohÂ  Girl, yeah YouÂ  On a night when bad dreams become a screamer When they're messin' with a dreamerÂ  I can laugh it in the faceÂ  Twist and shout my way outÂ  [music stops] I just don't think that the infrastructure is there to handle the water needs of our exploding population.
I hear you.
And with the clouds moving away from the equator, towards the poles, we're talking about a real crisis.
[both sigh] [music resumes] Oh, you Girl, yeah You make my dreams come trueÂ  Oh, yeahÂ  Wasn't Tito so wonderful to travel to us? He is a hero.
You remember I'm a war veteran, right? What? I mean, isn't it nice to see his face again? - I made that face with sex from your papi.
- What? So he doesn't show up when you're in the hospital, but he gets to horn in on the vacation that I didn't sleep for three nights, planning? You know he was abroad.
He called me.
Anything you have to hook up, I'm in.
Oh, and I have a great place for us to have dinner out later.
That's alright, 'cause I already made a reservation at a place calledÂ Veranda.
They offer a big discount if you eat before six, and it's the twins' birthday.
Oh, yeah, that place is great.
But is it on a boat? What?! I am so over land restaurants! Papito, you are so smart.
All restaurants should be on boats.
Okay, as long as it's okay with you.
Whatever, Tito little pito.
Lupita, that is just plain mean.
[crickets chirping] [Schneider sighs] You think there's life on other planets? I hope so.
I always thought I have an alien-ish physique.
Oh, you would crush it on another planet, Doc.
Man, before I got sober I never would have been able to enjoy something like this.
I always thought I needed drugs to see the beauty in things.
Well, I've just gotten into drugs myself, and, uh I've been using these medical marijuana lozenges to help me relax.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.
I can be around it.
Doesn't bother me.
Now.
I just need them to help me sleep, yeah.
I'm such an old-guyÂ clichÃ©.
You know, with the tossing and the turning and the constant night terrors with my ex-wife and daughters strangling me.
My daughters are filling my pockets with rocks.
I don't know much about dreams.
Maybe it means something good.
[sighs] Our minds are such mysteries.
How long have you been sober? Almost eight years.
Wow.
That is really impressive.
I can't even imagine the strength that must have taken.
[whispers] You are? Absolutely.
[exhales deeply] Do you know how long I've waited for any sort of father figure to say that to me? You think of me as a father figure? Of course.
You're my father, and Penelope is my muchÂ older sister.
I'm the miracle baby.
I'm sorry I'm getting so emotional.
My kids think of me as a failure figure.
Well, not this kid.
Ah, that ocean.
And my lean calves looked like they had been chiseled out of marble.
But when I stepped on the dance floor I suddenly saw [both imitate Lydia] My sister Maruchi had also entered the competition.
I am so happy that I brought you into this world to laugh at me.
Because of your giant heads, I pee when I cough.
Okay.
I'm gonna go out on the deck and take some photos for my Insta.
Yeah, it's been ten minutes.
People might start believing you actually have a life.
Come on.
Elena, go with your brother.
Haven't I already thrown up enough today? No one is wandering around alone.
We're on a boat.
- Where could I go? - Overboard? It happens all the time.
Have you not seen that movie Overboard? Or that other movie, the remake of Overboard? Well, I'm going.
Remember Mami never let us go to the freezer section of the supermarket alone because we might accidentally get trapped in there? [imitates Lydia] "In the freezer no one can hear you scream.
" [both imitate] "Everybody knows this.
- Bruce.
Tito was key in getting us that crucial fifth anchor in Restaurant Boat Magazine, so, uh consider all your wine on the house.
Oh, in that case, we'll have another bottle, or five.
Just kidding, four will do.
Well, we also have him to thank for getting us up in time for Fouth of July.
- It is great seeing you again, brother.
- [Tito] Same here.
[clears throat] You were here for the Fourth? So you were a two-hour drive away when Mami was in the hospital after her stroke.
Permiso.
What's up? El Capitan here.
Living that yacht life.
Right now I'm up on her stern.
That means her butt.
Peace.
[chuckles] Nice, so just because a boat is something someone can own, it has to be a woman.
I'm sorry.
Okay, I get it, you hate me.
What? No, I don't.
It just seems like everything I say makes you mad.
So? Everything everyone says makes me mad.
Well, it just makes me not want to talk to you.
Honestly, I didn't think you listened to me.
I mean, you're always on your phone or with your stupid friends.
Yeah.
I only want to kill you in the normal way too.
But yeah, I'm glad you don't hate me.
Of course I don't, stupid.
I don't want us to end up like TÃ­o and Mami.
I mean, they barely talk.
That'll never be us.
Have you met yourself? You like to talka lot.
Besides, we need each other.
Aww.
We got that twin thing.
Remember when we were little, Mami wouldn't let us go on the seesaw 'cause we weren't the same weight? "You're gonna launch your brother into freaking space!" Plus, some day I want nieces and nephews to throw cash at, like TÃ­o Tito.
I'm not having any kids.
Thenyour cats.
That is such a stereotype.
But yes, there will be cats.
Hey, how about this? I will take a picture of you for Instagram, if you stop talking about the boat's butt.
Deal.
[camera clicks] Nice work.
You really got my jawline.
Narcissism.
[laughs] Oh, come on.
[laughs] You are unbelievable.
Look, I didn't visit Mami at the hospital because I knew she wouldn't want me to see her like that.
- You know how she is.
Just like when Papi died.
What you talking about? I was there.
- For the funeral, that's it.
- [scoffs] Who do you think had to make all the arrangements? - Me.
- Yeah, I paid for everything.
- I don't want your freaking money.
- Right.
[chuckles] Papi was gone, Mami was in pieces, and you were nowhere to be found.
But too freaking bad, because we are the grown-ups now.
And we both have to step it up.
You've always been the grown-up.
Right? I mean, that's what you do.
You're the superwoman.
When Mami was in the hospital, I couldn't do it.
Lupe, I could not see Mami like that.
Bad stuff is gonna happen, Tito.
Am I gonna lose you, too? I know we have our things, but I miss you.
Jerk.
I miss you, too.
- Jerk.
- [chuckles] And you know, good stuff is gonna happen too.
And I really want you there for that.
[sniffles] You're right.
I'm sorry.
I love you even if you are Mami's favorite.
Ay.
What? - What? Shut up! No.
- It's true.
I know I get all the press, but, look, if this boat goes down, you know who she's saving.
- Alex.
- Yeah.
But then you.
You think she thinks I'm perfect.
Really, I just think she thinks she's perfect.
She kinda is.
Yeah, she kinda is.
But crazy.
Oh, off the rails.
Se el tren hace rato.
[laughs] Hey, uh - Does she still talk to Papi? - Oh, yeah.
Who pays? That's your question? [foghorn sounds] Hey, guys, check out these pictures Alex took of me.
He taught me how to "smeyes.
" That means smile with my eyes.
Oh? - I'm still working on it.
- Oh.
I'm just glad you two are getting along.
Yeah.
Our consanguinity has never been more indubitable.
Oh - It's okay.
- No.
No, it isn't.
It was selfish.
It'll never happen again.
I don't know what I would do if I lost you.
Ay, Papito.
[sniffles] Te quiero tanto.
[clears throat] Mirada I'm gonna be around more.
No.
- Yes? - Yeah.
Pupita has really been on my fotingo about it.
[Lydia laughs] She's right.
I guess, uh, we're both pretty lucky to have her.
Ay, Penelopita.
Can you believe how selfless he is to compliment you? I did not think it was possible, but now you are even more perfect than ever.
Go, Gladiators! So, you are not even playing this video game? You're just watching these other nerds playing the video game? This is the Overwatch League.
It's the world's top e-athletes.
E-who cares? [knock on door] That sounds like a weak-wristed knock.
Come in, Leslie.
[panting] Hi, everybody.
Exciting news.
I got two extra tickets to the opera.
Penelope, I was thinking maybe you and Mateo may want to come.
Are you sure? Opera-tunity only knocks once.
Ay, Leslie, no.
Maybe I can take those tickets.
Since when did you get into the opera, Elena? Well, I've been looking for an opera-tunity to go out on the town with my Syd-nificant other.
[Elena and Leslie laugh] Berto, I am ready.
No? Ah.
Hey, Mom, can I go skydiving? You're right, too dangerous.
I'll just go to the concert Dylan invited me to instead.
Yeah, nice try.
Few questions.
What concert is it? Where is it? Can I come? Oh, wait.
You're not going.
Please, Mom, it's Bud E.
Fest, this really chill outdoor music festival.
No! You could get kidnapped, trampled, or molested.
You never let me do anything because you always think I'm gonna get molested.
Sorry, buddy, but you ain't going to Buddy Fest.
Please, Mom.
There will be tons of security.
Plus, it's outdoors during the day.
It's basically a church picnic.
Look.
Come on, I'm 15.
How old were you when you went to your first concert? Seventeen.
Mami, that's right.
That Lisa Lisa thing was a crazy dream that I had that I snuck out to a concert, but really, I was home that night in bed, sleeping like two pillows under a blanket.
Well, I would never dream of sneaking out.
That's why I'm asking you.
'Cause I'm a good kid who tells his mother everything.
If you want to go to a concert, why don't you come with us to the opera? We have two extra tickets.
But I'm using those.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not doing anything.
Is this a jigsaw puzzle? Of my family? The only missing piece is me.
Well, I'm sorry for bursting in.
I'm really sorry.
Um, but I am worried about Alex.
Oh, don't be.
Once I get the outline of his head, the face will be easy.
Not that.
I remember my first concert in Canada.
Bryan Adams at the Chilliwack Moose Lodge.
Man, that mosh pit was wild.
There was a mosh pit at a Bryan Adams concert? Every concert has a mosh pit.
A girlfriend once took me to see Streisand, I almost lost an eye during "You Don't Bring Me Flowers.
" Okay, this is not helping me get over my crazy yet completely justified Cuban overprotectiveness! Look, at some point, you're going to have to start trusting Alex.
It's not like you can go everywhere with him and spy on him.
Or [hip hop music plays] Yeah, I think we blend in pretty well.
There's a lot of security.
Yeah, concerts have gotten so refined since my day.
I just got my beard trimmed at the grooming tent.
I was gonna get eyelash extensions, but the line was too long.
Seriously, that porta potty is nicer than my bathroom.
It has three-ply toilet paper.
Well, it did.
Okay, so Alex should be somewhere in that section over there.
Great.
What theWhat? Oh.
Whoops.
These are my bar-noculars.
I've been sober so long, I forgot I had these.
God! Oh, no, I'm not doing my move.
No.
Still works.
- Oh, my god, you Waldoed him! - Yup.
Oh! There's Waldito.
Oh.
Well, it looks like he's doing okay.
Wait.
Why is he holding a pen? Maybe he wants to get an autograph.
He's putting the pen in his mouth.
I do the same thing.
Pen, he's vaping.
Pen, vaping.
Vape pen, Pen.
Vape Oh, my god.
I did not even mean to do that.
Maybe it's just nicotine.
[Penelope] "Bud E.
Fest"? I cannot believe this concert is promoting marijuana! I wondered why Wiz Khalifa and Willie Nelson were performing at the same show.
Thank you so much for the ticket hookup, Dr.
B.
No problem.
It's a double date.
Double date? Who's the couple they're with? I am so excited.
I read that the part of Annio is a trouser role, a male part played by an actress in men's clothing.
Really? So this opera is gender-nonconforming! Like you.
You make everything gay.
How'd you get to me through those people? I had to crowd-surf across 2,000 hands.
And yes, I am aware of the irony that, technically, I am the one that ended up getting molested.
I cannot believe you were smoking pot.
I wasn't smoking,Â I was vaping.
Well, in that case, all good.
- Really? - No! How long has this been going on? It was my first time.
And last time.
Dylan's brother had it and everybody was trying it.
It was stupid.
Stupid of me to trust you.
Well, I won't be making that mistake again.
Because the next time you're allowed to go to a concert, it'll be so far in the future, robots will rule the galaxy.
And music will have been outlawed anyway.
What? I don't know.
I'm very upset! It's not that big of a deal.
It's not as bad as alcohol and everyone drinks.
What does booze even smell like? Don't be cute.
You're grounded.
Go to your room.
[sighs] [coughs] - [opera aria plays] - This opera's just so long.
And not enough intermissions when you have the bladder of a hummingbird.
Getting up in the middle of a solo? So disruptive.
[coughs loudly] Abuelita, you okay? I'm[coughs] I'm fine.
Do you have something to drink? Ah! [chuckles] You accidentally brought your real opera glasses instead of the ones filled with rum? What about a lozenge? Oh, Leslie has some.
" So, whatever.
Now I'm banned from Home Depot.
Thank you, Ramona.
And I think that completes the entire Westfield Mall.
Well, I have something to share.
Um, this afternoon, I went to Bud E.
Fest.
- Yeah, you did.
I went there to spy on my son.
Oh, that sounds more like you.
Yeah.
And I caught Alex smoking or whatever, vaping pot.
That stuff was everywhere.
It was like right out in the open.
Well, it is legal now.
I'm more of a Chardonnay and Tylenol PM gal myself.
I don't smoke since I'm sober, but, boy, did I like it.
Not me.
Weed make me paranoid, like everyone's out to get me.
'Cause when you're black, everyone is.
Well, marijuana has really helped me.
With the pain from your injury? Sure, we'll say that.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Yes, big time.
Yeah, my ex was one of them.
I smoke weed on occasion.
It's really chilled me out.
What were you like before? [laughs] Look, weed is just not my thing.
I mean, I get how it can be helpful or even kind of fun.
Of course I've tried it, but Alex can't know that.
He needs to think I'm perfect.
I think you're perfect.
Okay, well, we're adults.
Alex is 15.
That's true.
At that age, the brain is still developing.
So did you go all Home Depot on him? Okay, first of all, that's not a phrase normal people use.
And, no.
It was a one-time thing and he gets it now.
In fact, I didn't overreact.
Nipped it in the bud.
[laughter] Oh, no.
I wasn't trying to make a bud pun, but that was funny.
[laughs] No, we're laughing at how you think it was Alex's first time.
Yeah, it's cute.
That's what everyone says when they're teenagers.
"I didn't even like it.
" That's what Alex said.
- You've gotta search.
- What's wrong with you? Okay.
Well, I will now.
And if I find any marijuana, it's going right down the toilet.
Whoa.
Let's not be hasty! Pen, can you take a picture of me so I can Photoshop myself into the puzzle? Shh! What are you doing? Alex is downstairs doing punishment laundry, so I'm secretly searching his room for drugs.
But the women at the therapy group got me all worried for nothing.
I went over every inch of this room, I didn't find anything.
I have a lot of experience hiding drugs.
They used to call me "The Mole.
" 'Cause of the mole on my butt cheek.
Next to where I hid my drugs.
Let's focus on Alex.
I cannot believe he lied about it being a one-time thing.
Though I am happy he doesn't really use Flex body spray.
What the hell is all this stuff? When I was a kid, you had to roll a joint or smoke it out of an apple.
They'd just think you were another hoser your chuggin' syrup.
Do you think Alex has a real drug problem? No.
Look, there's some left.
That's a good sign.
Trust me.
It's probably just Alex being a teenager.
You'll deal with it.
He's great kid and you're an amazing mom.
Really? Yeah.
Dr.
B's got these lozenges.
He says they go straight into your bloodstream.
If you're not used to it, they can really whack you out.
You're fine one moment, then it kicks in.
Next thing you know, you're giggling uncontrollably.
- [opera aria playing] - [snickers] [guffaws loudly] It is gay! [Lydia laughs loudly] I get it.
[opera aria playing] [gasps] The Castros have found me! One guy I knew actually popped one at a movie theater and started talking back to the screen.
Give it up, Titus! Servilia only wants you as a friend! Like Leslie and me! Shh! Oh, my stars! [sings operatically] Thank god no one in my family is using that stuff.
- Looking for this? - No! What is that? Don't even.
This is what you're doing? I'm busting my ass for this family, and you're out there doing this crap? - I'm sorry, I - You lied right to my face.
I had to.
If I didn't lie, you would've said I couldn't do it.
'Cause you shouldn't do it! It's not that bad.
- It's legal now.
But you end up with cancer,Â cirrhosis, and prying your abuelita off the penny slots.
And none of those things are legal for you 'cause you're 15.
It's just a fun thing we do once in awhile.
Anyways, I get straight As.
You want for long if you're a stoner.
I'm not a stoner.
We laugh at those guys.
Besides, tons of successful people have smoked weed.
And trust me, for every success, there are a hundred losers whose lives never go anywhere.
And you really think it's healthy for you? You know that guy at the concert, Willie Nelson? Thirty-two years old.
No, he's not.
He's like your age.
No, he's not like my age! He's a lot older than me! [Penelope sighs] I am so disappointed in you.
You're a good kid, you're a smart kid, and you should know better.
I'm sorry I'm not perfect like you.
Trust me, I'm not perfect.
So, I get the curiosity.
But when you're a kid, it messes with your brain because it's still developing.
And you need to be especially careful because you're Latino.
Why? When I was 17, a cop caught me and my friend smoking pot at the beach.
I got dragged into the police station.
But my friend, Caroline, who was white, and I'm talking sunburn-at-night white, the cop let her go with a warning.
You got arrested? Oh, my god.
Abuelita must've freaked.
It's different for us.
" He was right.
So the reality is, if a white kid like Dylan gets caught with a little weed, he gets a cool story.
But you? You could end up in prison.
Your life will be over, and so will mineÂ because I couldn't bear to lose you like that.
I'm sorry, Mami.
I'll never do it again.
Oh.
A pregnancy test? No, it's a drug test, but now I'm concerned that you know what a pregnancy test looks like.
You know what? Another day.
Anyway, this is gonna happen, and your pee better be freaking perfect.
It will be, I swear.
[sniffs] Mmm.
You are using Flex body spray.
How many times in one day are you gonna disappoint me? And did you know that smoking marijuana can also cause gynecomastia? - What is that? - That's when men grow boobs.
Why didn't you just lead with that?! We could've skipped the rest of the conversation! [whimpers] I think we caught it in time.
I don't want to disappoint her too.
Baby, I would never do that.
I don't need that in my life.
If she asks why you're grounded, we'll just say you're being punished for spending time with a girl who's a bad influence.
"Mary Jane.
" I get it.
Like Peter Parker's girlfriend.
No, it's Forget it.
So, we got banned from the opera.
Man, we killed that all-you-can-eat buffet.
Yup.
What? It says, "All you can eat.
" I will eat all of it.
This is on them.
Oh, I'm with you.
[laughs] What else you got in there? That's not what I Never mind.
We should do something, right? Look, I like flowers, chocolates, and a stupid teddy bear I'm gonna throw in the trash as much as the next girl.
But we've both been married before.
We know that Valentine's Day sucks.
Let's just skip it.
I have been married before.
This smells like a trap.
It's not a trap.
My family is going out.
- We don't know each other that well.
- [chuckles] Okay.
Although, I was going use the occasion to make my big move since we haven't kissed yet.
No, no, don't talk about it.
What are you doing? Just making sure that I'm safely out of the friend zone.
You are out of the friend zone and you soon will have access to other zones.
- Okay, get out of here.
Get out.
- [theme song playing] - This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feetÂ  Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Come on, everyone.
I love you all but I want you gone.
We are going to have so much fun at the viejitos lawn bowling tournament.
[in sing-song] Lawn bowl so hard, other chuckers want to find me.
[blows] That sounds like a hell of a date.
You must be anxious to get it started.
Don't be silly, Lupe.
Leslie is not my date.
You're really this excited about watching lawn bowling? I've been grounded for three weeks with no phone or TV.
Last week, I read a Jane Austen book for fun.
Yeah, remember you're still grounded, and the only reason I'm letting you go is 'cause this seems worse.
What do you think? I think I'm glad you two found each other.
We are celebrating.
This is our first Valentine's together, and my first time acknowledging Valentine's since all the other years I was at home making fun of it 'cause, really, I was sad.
Why does your head look like a butt? [chuckles] They're hearts.
We are not doing the typical corporate Valentine's Day.
Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of women? Second only to these dimples.
Papito, you are the number one lady killer.
[chuckles] You are the lady serial killer.
Okay, Mami, getting weird.
Anyway, what we're doing is perfect.
Yeah.
What else are we gonna do? Have an amazing time at Benihana marveling at a volcano onion? [laughs] Yeah, right.
Oh, good, you're all here.
Listen, I'm begging you.
Make this quick.
- The Schneiders arrived in the New World.
- Quicker.
We got rich, but I told Avery, the girl that I'm dating, that I'm poor.
Sohow does that whole nightmare work? We're not poor, we're middle-class.
Yeah, that's good.
Tell me other things poor people say.
It's a shame, too, 'cause I just installed a hot tub and a high-tech Japanese toilet.
When you flush, it says, "Arigato.
" Take her to the Burbank Airport, watch the planes take off while eating Taco Bell drive-through.
Get her cinnamon twists if you want to go south of the border.
Bye! Damn, now I want Taco Bell.
What? You want me to steam my puka? Yeah, right.
Oh, fifty percent off.
Maybe.
That's a tomorrow problem.
Hey! No, no, no.
Go away or I will stick my foot up your Avery! Oh, God.
It's so nice to see you.
What are you two doing here? Well, there we were at the Burbank Airport, watching planes and eating chalupas.
I believe it was Jenny from my block who said, "Love don't cost a thing.
" It was so fun.
Whenever a private plane would fly over us, the pilot would wave at Schneider like he knew him.
Anyway, um, I'm kind of doing an alone thing for Valentine's Day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It gets better.
No.
No, no, no.
This It's by choice, obviously.
I mean Well, I usually dress better.
[chuckles] I'm sorry.
I live in one of those tiny houses, and my roommate wants to lie down.
So - And we don't feel like fighting the rain.
- What? Is it raining out there? Oh, yeah.
It's coming down like a waterfall in Bali.
I imagine.
The veijitas lawn bowling tournament turned into the veijitas wet T-shirt contest.
[groaning] No.
It was so beautiful on the outside.
Where's Mami? - [groans] Don't look at me! A horrible truth has been revealed.
Papito, get me a straightening iron and the Bible.
Can't we just get an umbrella and go back out there? Are you crazy? Everybody knows that going outside with wet hair is almost as deadly as walking barefoot in your own home.
Ay, Mami, a little rain never hurt anyone.
[screams] You both look like Carrie.
Don't be silly, Miss Alvarez.
I don't have telekinetic powers no matter how hard I try.
The rain ruined the fun run.
You look ridiculous.
Hmm.
Look who's talking, Chia Pet.
[gasps] And your hair is flat.
[gasps] You know what's crazy? We ran right past Benihana.
See all those people catching shrimp in their mouths and laughing? Yeah, all of those people having fun.
I am so glad we're beyond that.
Oh, hello.
We must have a party.
I will get my box of decorations.
- Leslie, get the box of decorations.
- No, no.
Guys, no! This is LA.
Rain lasts only five minutes.
It's gonna clear up.
[lightning crashes] Ay, fine.
Leslie, don't be depressing.
Sorry, it's kind of my default.
Who reads this crap? "32 Questions to Make You Fall Head Over Heels.
" Well, what are they? Ooh.
This looks fun.
Question one.
Schneider.
"What's your favorite childhood memory?" Uh Have you ever seen Forrest Gump? - No.
Wow, Mom, you clean up nice.
Oh, thank you.
You're still grounded.
But I'll admit it's nice to have an excuse to dress up.
Come on.
If you want to get out of the apartment, help me find the champagne flutes in the garage because we are having a party! You're having a party? We are having a party.
[vocalizes mambo music] Nah, man, we ain't having no party.
Okay.
I, reallyI was supposed to be alone having a romantic time with myself.
Let me start that over.
Uh, the rain ruined everything, and everybody came back, and we're Cuban, so now we're having a party.
Well, I'm Colombian, so I actually get that.
Except with my mom, it's not [vocalizes mambo music] It's [vocalizes Colombian music] Do I hear a Colombian? Thank you for my flowers.
You should stay.
- But my socks are wet.
- You can take them off.
Mami, you're gonna love him.
Hey, Sam's dad.
What's the news from the outside? Do they still have the Internet? Still grounded, huh? I'd kill for a cat video right now.
Why don't you invite Sam over? Maybe being around someone his own age will take the edge off.
Oh, I would but he's spending the night at his mother's.
Maybe next time.
We didn't have a dime to our name but I needed those leg braces.
So Mama marched up those stairs and did what she had to.
Hey, I'm so sorry that our plans turned into this.
But we can still do something socially aware.
Like, did they ever free Tibet? We should check on that.
Or we could just keep hanging out at the party.
I'm kind of curious to find out what happened to Schneider's friend, Bubba.
There's pineapple shrimp, coconut shrimp [Leslie sighs] Leslie, your breathing is so sad.
Stop breathing.
I'm sorry.
[gasps] Pobrecito.
And the divorce papers arrived on April Fool's.
You can imagine the confusion.
Wow! I was sad about my life until just now.
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, Leslie, you cannot go through life like there's a cloud over your head.
[Lydia gasping] I am a bruja.
I knew it.
The super will fix it.
Schneider, fix it! I'm on it! Let me just go get my tool belt.
Ooh.
Is it in your apartment? No.
It's next to the trash-can fire I use to keep warm.
Let's finish the questions.
I thought of a lot more dream vacation spots.
Reno, the biggest little city in the world.
Fine, let's just do what you want to do, again.
Hold on.
What do you mean by that? You think everything I want to do is stupid or a joke.
When did I say that? Only the three times I said I wanted to go to Benihana.
I thought that was a stupid joke! Oh.
I've been dropping hints left and right.
Maybe you should pay a little less attention to the world and a little more attention to me.
Or maybe you should be a little less passive-aggressive and just tell me what you want! Fine! I want to leave! But I can't because my dad isn't picking me up for two hours.
You guys don't live on the top floor.
So this can't be rainwater.
Oh.
It got in my mouth.
So, where is this water coming from? That's as far as I got.
Well, let's ask the water where it's coming from.
Um, it's warm, and it smells like bergamot and hibiscus.
[sniffs] Ooh.
Wait.
You have a hot tub? No.
That would be crazy for a simple boy from Alabama Okay, I'm rich! Like, really rich.
I own this building.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I just thought you'd think less of me if you knew I had a lot of money.
[sighs] I don't I don't think less of you.
What's happening? Is that a Dries Van Noten blouse? Yes.
I didn't make it on purpose.
No, no, no.
Â I know that pain.
You spend and you spend and you spend, and there's always more.
Oh, this is some bull.
Look, II do have a tiny house.
I just keep it in the ballroom of my giant house.
I just wanted you to like me.
Right.
Let's go fix my hot tub.
Or better yet, let's pay someone else to do it.
Oh! Que romÃ¡ntico! Whoo! Is it always like this over here? Come dance with me.
[dance music plays] Hey.
I just want to tell you that I'm really glad you came over tonight.
Me too.
I feel very much at home here.
[cellphone rings] - Sorry.
- It's okay.
My son.
Everything okay? First, unload the dishwasher, then PlayStation.
All right.
I'll see you when I get home.
I thought you said Sam was with his mom.
What? Oh.
It's Elena, isn't it? I know she's a lot.
No, Elena is great.
Alex? What's wrong with Alex? Sam's only 15.
I just want to keep him awayÂ from certain things for as long as possible.
This is about the weed thing? Alexmade a mistake like every teenager who's ever lived.
He's a good kid.
And if you haven't noticed, he's being punished by a really on-it mom.
Look, I'm not gonna apologize for being overprotective, or as we Colombians call it, "Colombian.
- You know what Colombians are known for? - Don't you say it! We also have coffee and Shakira.
Look I did what I thought was right.
I didn't even let him go on sleepovers till he was 14.
Fourteen? You let a baby sleep over at a stranger's house? You call that overprotective? We didn't even have furniture with corners on it until Alex was 12.
My son's never been in a public pool! I make my kids wear flip-flops in our own shower 'cause I don't know where we've been.
We are both very overprotective people! I guess so! - It's nice to be with someone who gets it.
- Right? I mean, it's not like we're crazy.
No, everybody else is crazy for not being like us.
Have you tested your paint for lead? Of course.
I tested your paint for lead.
That is so hot.
Hey.
Hey.
- Are you going to break up with me? - What? No, I'm here to tell you that green makes my eyes pop.
I could have told you that.
I'm really sorry that I didn't take your ideas seriously.
Our first fight.
[chuckles] It was a real knock-down, drag-out emotional brawl.
How do you make sure we never have one of those again? Just take me to Benihana.
How can I be clearer? Look.
I love that you're woker than a barnyard rooster.
Butsometimes you just want to hang out with your best gal at a restaurant that's not just a meal.
It's an experience.
I made you something.
I love you.
I meanI hope that's okay.
But I do.
Of course it's okay.
I love you too.
Sorry, we're such a clichÃ© saying I love you for the first time on Valentine's Day.
I'm too happy to care.
This is the best thing anyone's ever gotten me.
[gasps] Thank you, Schneider! Whoo! Ha-ha! Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Thought we'd come back to the party instead of heading to some fancy restaurant.
We're not too elite to hang with the real peeps.
Late reservation? 10:30 was the earliest we could get.
I'm your classic ninth wheel.
[babbles] Just for the record, Abuelita and I are not together.
Leslie.
I want to tell you something.
Valentine's Day was Berto's day to shine.
Every detail was perfect.
Every piece of chocolate, every petal on every flowerÂ impecable.
Butafter Berto, I knew that there was no way that I would ever have a date with someone else on Valentine's Day.
But [inhales] I figured if I spent the day with my grandson, and we had a chaperone that would be okay.
Yeah? We should share a kiss.
I'm going to eat this even though I'm highly allergic.
This isn't how I saw Valentine's Day going.
[chuckles] But I'm glad it happened.
Salud.
Salud.
The rain has stopped, things are finally starting to look up.
Run, Schneider, run! [theme music plays]
Dang, son! I'm killing this budget spreadsheet.
Being an adult is sad.
I get that.
I have returned.
Dang.
What happened to your nose? I went shoe-shopping with your mother.
Yeah, that tracks.
Abuelita, you got the shoes! You're my hero.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I really had to fight for them.
Mami, we talked about this.
- You cannot keep spoiling Alex.
- I'm not.
I just went to pick them up for him because he is still grounded.
Three hundred dollars for one pair of shoes? They better come with $280 stuffed in them! Mom, I did exactly what you told me to do.
You said that if I wanted to buy expensive shoes, I had to earn my own money.
I did say that.
Lesson number two.
Don't buy stupid stuff.
Come here.
Look at my credit card statement.
Every dollar is budgeted.
Somebody must've stolen my credit card number.
For seven dollars? Not how I would have played it.
No, no, no.
This is what they do.
They start by racking up little charges to make sure the card works.
Macy's, Nike, Harley-Davidson.
Then you realize they're living your best life.
Did you cancel the card? No, I wanted to see what I would have done next.
What are you gonna accuse me of next? Not washing and reusing tinfoil? What was the name on the credit card? Elena Alvarez? Wait! [Penelope] Thank you.
Hi! Why did you use your emergency credit card at the Fountain Hotel? And what were you even doing there? A few people had died there.
I was ghost hunting.
- No, you weren't.
- No, I wasn't.
Elena, come on.
Be honest.
[clears throat] Syd and I got a hotel room.
Mami, where are you going? I'm not quite sure.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - It's so nice to see you.
- Uh-huh.
What's wrong with Elena? What? Nothing.
I just wanted to hang outside of group.
It's been a while since The last time you wanted to know lesbian stuff about Elena.
That's the only reason you call.
Come on, girl.
What do you want to talk about? What's up with the bees? Are they coming back or what? [chuckles] Just ask me a question about Elena.
It's fine.
I kind of like being your lesbian Yoda.
I think she's having sex.
[in a robotic voice] I will need another drink.
I don't know Yoda.
[Schneider clears throat] So your mom has asked me to give you a little chat about irresponsible spending.
Yeah.
Yeah, she's really starting to lean on me as a co-parent.
[Schneider] Take a gander.
Really old comic books, unopened Star Wars toys, Shirley Temple's tap shoes.
Why did I think they'd fit? Who would want all this crap? Schneider, all this stuff is really cool.
Is it? Or is it just a symbol of a young man who tried to use money to fill the hole in his soul? It didn't work.
Yeah, but now all of this stuff is worth tons of money.
Is it? Wait.
Is it? You own the Ghostbusters car? Yes, I do.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
He died while I was at that auction.
Turns out, he needed a quadruple bypass.
I will always regret that day.
'Cause you were so selfish, you forgot family is more important than anything.
No.
'Cause I should have waited and bid on the Back to the Future car.
Or told Gary to have that fourth bypass, but whatever, your thing works, too.
See, I know what I would say to Elena if she were straight.
Use a condom.
Take the pill.
Don't have sex.
Well, when you're a lesbian, it's even simpler.
You don't need a condom, you don't need the pill, and the best part, four boobs.
Okay.
But what about STDs? Safe lesbian sex is not my area of expertise.
I mean, what do you use? A dish glove? A swim cap? A thimble? Do you even have a vagina? There's hardly any risk physically.
She's gonna be fine.
So what? I'm supposed to be okay that she's having sex? I'm a mom.
She's my kid.
I can't condone this.
No, Ramona.
When did I become the bad guy? I'm just trying to make you less worried, and I can assume it's with Syd, who she's been dating forever? [exhales deeply] Elena's 17.
And what did your mom say? [scoffs] Are you kidding me? She doesn't know.
I was sneaky.
I didn't put her through the torture of thinking about this.
As far as she knows, I had sex once to make Elena.
And how does she think Alex got here? She tells people she had him.
If you're gonna be a sexually active teenager, you need to do it responsibly and make sure your parents never find out.
But now I know, and I have to have an opinion.
And I don't want to be the mom that's all, "Sex is dirty.
I'll get you water, so you stay hydrated.
" Now I have to talk to her.
[cries] I don't want to.
Oh, Papito, how are the shoes? Great.
I sold them.
[dish clangs] I know, I know, but they were already worth twice as much as what I paid for them.
How could you do such a thing? I stood in line for hours! I know, and Dr.
Berkowitz got a busted nose.
Abuelita, I really appreciate what you did.
Mm-hmm.
So I'm going to use some money to take you out to dinner.
Aww, Papito.
You do a lot for me, and it's time I paid you back a little.
And unlike Mami, I'm gonna let you get an appetizer and a beverage.
[laughs] I know that's how they get you.
But they're gonna get us.
We got to do this.
I don't want to do it either, but here goes.
I'm your mom.
My first instinct is to protect you.
I mean, if I had it my way, I'd keep you hidden away from the world in my mouth like a freaking pelican.
Actually, Finding Nemo is really misleading.
Pelicans Okay, I'm halfway through a very prepared speech.
Even though I sometimes wish it weren't happening, you're growing up.
It's a roller coaster.
One day, you're fine.
Next day, you have sex.
The day after that, the boy you lost your virginity to doesn't call you back, and you're filling the glove compartment of his Camaro with tuna so he knows he messed with the wrong girl.
Then you're called "Tunelope" for the rest of high school.
Worth it? Yes.
Okay, you lost me.
[sighs] What I mean is that it's very emotional.
But it's also not something that you should take lightly.
And I just want to make sure that you're okay with what did or didn't happen.
So, are you okay? Well Hey, guys.
Mom, that was a really gendered greeting.
Don't try to distract me from the fact that this door was closed when you know it should be open.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm sorry too about the gendered greeting.
Later, dudes.
We never get to be alone.
And I love just making out with you, but - Yeah.
- Yeah? Because I think I'm ready for more if you're ready.
I'm definitely ready to do more than fumble with your bra whenever your mom isn't checking on us.
Which is only when she's in the bathroom.
Remember when she got food poisoning? That was so hot.
Okay, so what do we do? Where can we be alone? What do they do in teen movies? I feel like a lot of stuff happens in parked cars.
Damn.
Can I ask a favor since I spend the afternoon chaperoning two horny nerds? Sure, honey, anything.
Can I have tomorrow off from being grounded? Aww.
No.
You screwed up, and now you are my prisoner.
Psst! Papito.
Do you, uh, need something from the outside? The new Yeezys drop tomorrow.
Jesus is coming back tomorrow? I just spoke to him.
He didn't tell me anything.
Consider it done.
I will get you those shoes even if I have to cut off somebody's feet.
You just have to stand in line.
Oh, fine.
Suck the fun out of it.
Which reminds me.
I will invite Leslie.
Really? Okay.
No need.
I will just get the ones that go best with your church pants.
What? No.
Okay.
Then I'll get whatever's on sale.
That's worse.
Abuelita, we need to find a way for you to get me exactly what I want.
Is it working? Can you see what the phone is pointing at? Yes! Now please turn it around.
You know, like we've done a million times.
Ugh, so sick of it.
That's the life we chose as traveling astronauts.
Thatis the name of our band.
Good save.
I'll just need a credit card.
Well, uh, sir, we were hoping that we could pay for this room in cash.
Cash from all our music gigs.
- Do you have a credit card? - No.
- Do you have one? - Kind of.
My mom gave me one, but it's supposed to be for emergencies only.
I mean, it is kind of an emergency.
[giggles] Yeah, she's not gonna see it that way.
Not that I was totally listening, but heads-up on that credit card.
It's just a precaution.
It won't be charged.
[Elena chuckles] And no trash in the room, rockstars.
Aww! That sucks, square.
Sorry.
Ugh! Musicians.
Oh! It's our turn finally.
Nice.
Remember, just repeat after me.
Hi.
All right.
Next.
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.
You're grounded, which, you know, means you're not supposed to be on your phone on the weekends.
Hello.
Hello, Alex? Hello? Oh, no.
Papito has been compromised.
We want the Jesus shoes.
- Yeezys.
- Yeah.
These are the two pairs that just dropped.
Thank you for picking them up.
How do we know which ones he wants? Well, the yellow ones are pretty sharp.
Right.
We'll take the blue one, size eight.
I speak Spanish because I grew up in Cuba.
As a child, I had to flee.
I escape with absolutely You're not getting my shoes.
No, wait.
Listen.
I am going to tell you something I have never told anybody before.
You would probably not believe it.
I am old.
Oh, please.
This is for my grandson.
He is the most important person in the world to me.
You know, I know I might not be around forever, but these shoes will be.
Maybe it's silly to you, but I just want him to have something to always remember me by.
Wow, I get that.
I guess he can remember you as the grandmother who didn't get him these bitching kicks.
[chatter in disagreement] You have four pairs.
Don't be that guy.
You know how long she must have had to save up for those? Yeah, man, don't be a racist.
Give the maid the shoes.
[chatter] [girl] Come on! - Fine! - You got plenty of them.
[Lydia gasps] Thank you.
Thank you.
[Lydia laughs] Lydia, you did it! Pa'lante! [Leslie groans] [laughs] Andlet's begin.
That was weird.
Right? Boom! One of us has the sheet here, the other has it down here.
[Elena chuckles] Oh, wait.
I wanted to set the mood, so I made a playlist of the sexiest songs.
["The X-Files" theme plays] X-Files.
Wait.
[music stops] So, I just want you to know how incredible I think you are.
I am so happy that you're the first person I'm doing this with.
And I think that you are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life, and I can't believe your heart is even more beautiful.
All right.
We talked the talk, now we got to walk the walk.
Do you consent to engage in sexual activity with me? An enthusiastic "yes"! - Do you? - Oh, hell yes! As agreed, our safe word is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Hey, did you bring a condom? Uh, yeah.
I've had one in my wallet since, like, eighth grade.
[Elena laughs] When was the last time you got tested? Last year when I was with Selene.
Wait, are you serious? You've had sex before.
Yeah.
I didn't tell you because I didn't even want to talk to you about it until I was sure you were ready.
I didn't want to put any pressure on it.
I just thought this was gonna be both of our first times.
Well I wasn't in love then, but I am now.
So in a way, this is my first time, too.
I also wanted you to think that I was awesome at it right out the gate.
But mostly, I wanted to make sure this happened on your terms.
This is a big deal.
How did I not think about any of this before? Are you okay? You're gonna see me naked.
Like, full naked.
You think this is white.
This has never seen the sun.
But then again, virginity is just a construct used to uphold the patriarchy, and I can't even get pregnant.
So who cares? Okay, but now that I really think about it I don't know.
I'm scared.
What if this changes everything, and not in a good way? Elena, there's no rush.
No matter what happens, I love you.
I love you, too.
Let's just watch a movie.
There's a Harry Potter marathon on, and I brought Every Flavour Beans in case this happened.
Did you hear something fall? - No.
- Okay.
So, are you okay? Well yeah.
I am.
But now that I do, I am glad that we're talking like this.
And I'm glad you had a good experience.
And that it happened with someone you love.
But I'm still your mom, and the rules of this house stay the same.
That door stays open.
Okay, Mami.
- Do you want to know the best part? - No.
I took all the toiletries.
[Lydia] In here, Papito.
I would have rather walked in on you two doing it.
Ay, cochino! You know, I have it on my bucket list to paint a masterpiece.
Oh, I can't wait to see how I look! Okay.
Wow.
You've really captured my essence.
[door opens] Oh, my God! You're so frustrating.
- I'm teaching you to drive.
You told me to hurry up and slow down.
Which one is it? It's both.
That's why you're not ready.
Ooh, you really captured his essence.
Anyway, I ain't got no money for driving school.
So you're stuck with me, unless you can find a sucker with nothing better to do than get behind the wheel with you.
[snaps] I'll do it.
- Really? - Yes, I'd love to, and I have a spotless driving record.
I mean, I assume.
I don't know what old ladies do.
Wow, Dr.
B, this would really help me out.
And my boards are coming up, and this is really stressing me out.
Elena, this is going to be such fun.
My father taught me using his patented 30-point system.
Thirty points? Agreed.
I figure two hours per point, you'll be driving by Passover.
Sowe're gonna be in a car together for 84 hours.
Oh, please.
We don't even get into the car until hour 12.
- [theme song plays] - This isÂ it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time It's cool that juggling is on your bucket list.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
I have done it.
- [Lydia] Okay, Lupe.
Now we go to the kitchen.
Come join me.
It's time to finally teach you all of my family recipes.
Mami, that sounds really nice, and I would love to right after my board exams.
I completely understand, but hear me out.
You have no choice.
It's on my bucket list.
Mami, I don't even have time to tell you that I don't have time.
Lupita, I have two great legacies: my family recipes and a neckline that almost capsized a Carnival Cruise.
Mami, just write the recipes down, then we can have them forever.
I cannot do that.
My sister, Mirtha, will break in, she will steal the recipes, she will rappel out the window, and ticky-tocky, she will be on the Food Network winning the Chopped.
Mami, you know I love you, but I cannot do this right now.
I promise you, one day we will, and we will have a great time together.
Okay? Okay.
A list of [sniffs] [crying] disappointments.
Okay.
Seat belts are buckled.
You've adjusted the mirrors.
Now, I want you to peek at yourself in the rearview and say, "Hot cakes! Am I a winner?" I'm not doing that.
Skipping step 19.
So, I just wanted to thank you again for teaching me how to drive.
You must be so busy.
- What show? - No, all of Netflix.
I'm just glad to be doing this with anybody but my mom.
She's always yelling and criticizing my every move.
- Well, no yelling here.
- [sighs deeply] Now, shift and carefully pull out.
[car crashes] See, right now, my mom would definitely be yelling at me.
Mami, I'll see you later.
I'm on my way to therapy.
Hey, your mom wanted to pass down her family recipes to someone worthy.
So she's teaching me everything.
Yeah, this is on me for walking in.
Mmm! Ay, Schneider.
It is like you are the true heir of my spirit.
[laughs] Dale, Schneidito Dale Whoo! Whoo! Dale, Schneidito Dale - Okay, I get it.
- Get what? There is nothing to get.
Other than a bowl of Schneider's sopa de pollo, which he will be ableÂ to pass down to his daughter's handyman.
It's not the cashiers.
It's the bag boys.
"Please let us help you to your car.
" I know what you're up to, comunistas.
All right, papito.
Abre tu boca.
Provocative flavor profile.
Good ratio of ropa to vieja.
[laughing] Oh, my God.
Mami, you are being so ridiculous.
- Huh? - I say no to you once, and you adopt a 40-year-old five-year-old? Don't talk to Mami like that! Okay.
Bye, crazy people.
[sighs] Sometimes I can't believe we're related.
All right.
No damage to the car, got me a fresh pair of pants.
Bingo-bango, we're back on the road.
That mailbox came out of nowhere.
I think the problem is you're driving your mirrors.
It means you're spending more time worrying about what's behind you - and not enough on what's ahead.
- [sighs] I justI get so overwhelmed.
Elena, I get it.
Driving's hard.
Got a million people coming at you.
And, yeah, you could die at any moment.
New approach.
Are you a Battlestar Galactica fan? The original or the reboot? I don't know why I asked.
I love them both.
And I assume you like the character Starbuck? [giggles] Starbuck.
Do you remember when she hijacked the Cylon spacecraft, but she couldn't figure out how to fly it? Season one, episode five.
She just focused on power, pitch, yaw and roll, and flew that baby home.
So, for you, it is accelerate, brake, steer, avoid mailboxes.
That actually helps.
I'm frakking flying this bad boy.
Can you believe my mom? I told her I'm too busy to cook, and she replaces me with Schneider.
Wait, so you're mad she turned your hot handyman into a hot chef? When are you gonna hook me up with him? Well, we all know mother-daughter relationships can be real triggers for stress.
- Thank you, Pam.
- Yep.
Whether it's cooking with you or keeping a secret family in Alhambra.
I mean, these relationships can be tricky.
She has no sympathy for how busy I am.
That's nuts.
If she'd have write them down, where'd she keep 'em? Sorry.
I'd take her paella over sex with Schneider.
Although both could be involved.
Your mother is incredible, Penelope.
When I had my baby, she's the only oneÂ who could get her to stop crying.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, she dipped her pacifier in rum, butpff, it worked, so Uh, you guys don't spend enough time with her.
Do you think she'd like to meet my new sister? She's a lot, okay? She's constantly criticizing everything about me.
She's the most stubborn person I know.
You're telling me the woman who when your daughter came out overcame all her religious objections and accepted her in one second.
She needs to accept the fact that I don't have six hours to make ropa vieja.
I have a lot on my plate.
'Cause your mother's always cooking for you? Oh! [all laughing] My mom cookedmeth.
My mom is a pain in the nalgas.
That is the train we should all be riding here, people.
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'Cause you asked for it 'Cause you need oneÂ  You see Sara Bareilles, Janelle Monet, Indigo Girls.
You know you didn't have to make a special lesbian playlist for me.
- I didn't.
Sapphic folk is my jam.
- [both chuckle] I'm not gonna write you to stay Ay, ay If all you have is leavingÂ  I will need a better reason To write you A love song todayÂ  [phone dings] [automated voice] Incoming text message.
Oh, sorry.
I get my texts through Bluetooth.
[automated voice] Message from Rachel.
Call me when you send it.
Neutral faceÂ emoji.
I'm jazzed at how upbeat she sounds.
Really? Oh, this is huge.
She wants me to call her.
[automated voice] Actually, don't call.
Just send money.
I loveVenmo.
Truth is I blame myself.
Between med school, and residency, and hospital rotations, I wasn't around much when she was a kid.
And I would love it if we could just get to the point where Rachel would ask me how I was doing before she asked me for money, but there's too much water under the bridge.
[automated voice] Just checked my account.
Still no money.
So sick of this.
Poop emoji.
Okay.
B.
[singing sadly] 'Cause you asked for one 'Cause you need one You see I'm not gonna write you a love songÂ  'Cause you're telling meÂ  Hey, now that I'm officially a member of la familia, maybe I could add something to the Alvarez Family Museum.
Oh, it's very exclusive.
It has to be a report card, or a trophy, or any tooth from Alex's mouth.
My eight-year sobriety chip.
[sighs deeply[ It would be my honor.
Oh.
[laughs] Ironically, the only other Wall of Fame I've been on was my favorite bar, Tom Bergin's, for inventing something called the tequila bong.
Schneider.
Okay, viejita, you win.
I would love to learn your recipes.
Get out of my house.
Blinker on.
Check in the mirror.
All clear.
Quick glance, over my shoulder, and pulling safely in.
Rachel's house.
Wow.
I paid for it, but I've never seen it before.
How did you know where to go? Well, when we stopped for gas, I looked through your contacts.
Oh, and your daily smile reminder went off.
Oh, thanks.
So I was thinking about your relationship with Rachel, and I realize that you are also driving your mirrors.
You need to stop dwelling on the past and start focusing on what's ahead.
[sighs deeply] I don't know.
I don't think she wants to see me.
Look I have some experience with father-daughter baggage.
And even when things were at their absolute worst, I still just wanted a hug.
To hear him say he loved me.
I bet Rachel's no different.
Okay, I'll do it.
And, uhthanks, Elena because I never would have come here on my own.
I better get in there.
Oh, watch out for that dog! - [dog barks] - Oh! Justjust forget the shoe! Just keep going.
[barking continues] [upbeat music playing] Whoo! All right! Mami, I think my arroz con pollo is almost ready.
- Uh-huh.
- And I gotta admit I'm a little nervous about having you taste it, which says something considering I was, you know, in a war.
[both laugh] Okay.
Let's take a look.
- Oh! - Uh-huh? No? - Just kidding.
- Yeah.
Bravissima, Lupita! With pollo that good, no man will dare to leave you again.
Excuse me.
What did you just say? I said, "Bravissima!" It means "job well done" in Italian.
Mami, did you want to teach me to cook because you think it'll help me get a man? Because I got one, Mateo, and he's great.
Of course he is.
You never had trouble finding wonderful men.
This is so you can keep them.
But I'm starting to think it might be because of the annoying Cuban lady - who moved into my dining room.
- Oh.
Now, you are getting mad for nothing.
There are always things to work on.
So I am helping you.
That's why this was on the list.
"Fix Penelope.
" [scoffs] Fix me? What the hell does that mean? No, no, no, no, no.
I'm a nurse.
They're scrubs! Lupita, you are a beautiful woman.
Why not dress like a sexy nurse? Everyone on Grey's Monotony looks amazing! What else do you think needs fixing? Nothing! Abuelita, the teeth-whitening trays you ordered came.
Listen, Mami, I have accomplished a lot in my life.
When will I ever be enough for you? It is not that you are not enough.
It is that I have not finished my job as a mother.
What're you talking about? I'm 40.
I have a good career.
You're done.
Done? You use a Trader Joe's bag as a purse! That was one time! Mira, when I woke up from that coma, my first thought was[gasps] "I cannot believe I almost left Lupita alone.
" So, no matter what I do, I'm a failure if I'm not married? Gracias a Dios, you finally get it! Oh, my Look I know in your day pleasing a man was a woman's greatest achievement.
You got that right.
I had to be great in the kitchen, better on the dance floor, and do my best work on my knees.
Aye, Mami, gross! Que? I kept that floor very clean.
I had to.
Your father and I made love on it all the time.
But you are constantly telling me that it is, and everything else that you think is wrong with me.
How do you think that makes me feel? You're always comparing me to you because you think you're so perfect.
But a perfect mom doesn't make her kid feel like this.
Bueno.
Okay, Mom, I won't tell you about my driving lesson because I know it stresses you out.
So I'll just say that it went well, and Dr.
Berkowitz took a huge step with his daughter.
She let him give her cash in person.
You're perfect.
[sighs] What? I want you to knowthat you are enough.
Is this some passive-aggressive Mom way of telling me not to gain weight? [laughing] No! No.
I just want you to know that I'm not judging you, and I am in awe of who you've become.
And if, for one second, I ever made you feel like you weren't a freaking perfect piece of work, then I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't know what happened while I was gone, but I like you like this.
Lupita.
I just want to say that I'm not sorry.
Wow.
Thanks.
Mira, whatever comes out of my mouth comes out because I love you, and I want you to be happy.
I am not trying to hurt your feelings, pero if you want me to accept you for being you, you have to accept me for being me.
Lupita.
To me you are the most perfect person alive.
There is no one even close to you.
You have to say it.
Okay.
Okay.
You are enough.
You are more than enough.
- Okay.
- Okay? Ay, I said too much.
[chuckles] Anyways, herethe recipes.
- Uh-huh.
Wait.
These measurements don't make sense.
"A whisper of paprika"? "Enough butter to make a man fall off a horse"? Oh, yes, it is written in code.
[laughs] The key will be delivered upon my death.
I hope I never see that key.
Oh.
[sighs] Given the way you take care of yourself, I may outlive you.
Oh, god! Do you think I have cancer? It's not cancer, but your family is still gonna be be very upset.
It's gas.
Are you sure? You had Cajun food at 3:00 a.
m.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Just take some antacid.
You'll be fine.
[chuckles softly] Hey, Doc,Â maybe I'm just second-guessing myself, - but can I get a consult? - [Leslie] Sure.
She had intestinal discomfort? Yeah, but she also ate two pounds of blackened catfish.
Penelope, have you learned anything at all studying for your board exams? A nurse practitioner should know that appendicitis classically presents as lower right quadrant pain.
If her appendix ruptures, she could die.
Or worse, sue me! I would be penniless.
I would lose my penny collection, and it's all your fault.
[Mrs.
Homer groans] I don't feel so good.
On second thought, We should check your appendix to make sure it doesn't - [splats] - [screams]rupture.
Oh, man! She did drop a monster belch in the hallway.
Nice.
She never even came back in, but at thatÂ moment, I started to spiral, and my brainÂ went to the worst-case scenario.
My worst-case scenario is the world ending, and I have to eat my mother.
Ew.
And the whole time, all she's talking about is, "You are still too skinny.
" So you get it.
Once my brain goes there, I can barely breathe.
After mine, I'm just drenched in sweat.
So to cover, I say, "I just got some.
Up top!" [laughs] Well, I always freak out during fireworks.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Makes me feel like I'm right back in combat.
I know, right? The other day, a kid threw a snap at me.
Before I knew it, I had him in a headlock.
And then I remember how much I pay for a one bedroom in Koreatown.
Then the cycle just starts all over again.
Grounding yourself is so important.
Sit somewhere you feel safe.
Focus on your breath and think about what's real.
All great coping mechanisms.
Is somethingÂ triggering you? That's just it.
No.
Plus, I have a sexually-active teenage daughter, a fragile, elderly mother, and a son doing drugs.
[breathes shakily] But I think I'm handling it well.
Aw, honey, you're a mess.
[laughs] Okay, maybe it is all getting to me, but I haveÂ found some coping mechanisms that work.
Alex, did you do your homework? This is my homework.
I'm in high school.
[gasps] I'm majoring in doobies with a minor in Doritos.
Ooh! I can turn this into a bong.
[breathes heavily] What's real? What's really happening? I'm literally about to do my homework.
You don't have to remind me.
[hyperventilates] Are you okay? Why are you breathing so heavy? The ghost of your abuelito just passed through me.
That makes sense.
Abuelita comes out of her curtain all sweaty and says that too.
No one says "doobie" anymore, stupid.
You're the same age as me, stupid.
I'm having a really rough time, Pam.
A Hungry-Man frozen dinner and a hungry man from Tinder.
Okay, none of those are healthy coping mechanisms.
I need something stronger than just grounding.
My go-to is the stop sign.
Like whenÂ I found out that Gina was cheating on me, and I lost it.
I found myself standing over a pile of her clothes, ready to set them on fire.
Well, I hope in that moment, you asked yourself what was real.
I did, and the answer was a can of gas in this hand and a book of matches in the other.
Yeah, because I'm too pretty for jail.
[chuckles] I mean, look at this.
I tried the stop sign the other day when this thing happened with Mateo.
Your boyfriend? If you're thinking about checking his phone, that's a sign to check his phone.
No, that's not it, and we're still trying to figure out what we are.
He's getting real comfortable, though.
[sighs] I could just stay like this forever.
I signed us up for joint checking.
Hey, babe, you mind grabbing me something from the fridge? Oh, wait.
I can get it myself 'cause I live here now.
Hey, what do you say we go have competent but unspectacular sex? Not all techniques work for all people.
Not all boyfriends work for all people.
Oh, no, he's great.
I mean, he's nice.
You know, he's a really good guy.
That bad, huh? Penelope, it does sound like you don't lean on your romantic partner for emotional support.
Well, sometimes, I talk myself down.
But when that doesn't work, I turn to And I cannot believe I'm about to admit this.
Schneider.
You bone that dude? No! Look, I know it's hard to believe, but Schneider is oddly calming.
Like white noise.
The whitest of noises.
I know he's a privileged, hipster, clueless man-baby who thinks he's Latino but still pronounces the H in "hola," but he gets me.
We have a system, you know.
Like the other day when I was taking a practice test.
[timer beeps] Pencils down.
I said, "Pencils down," Mom! - I got one more question left.
- No.
How cool is this? You taking your practice NP test.
Me taking my practice SAT test.
Mine's harder.
No, I'm kidding.
[laughs] Yale.
Narrowing it down, huh? Yes, to Yale! [giggles] So many things to think about.
Should I join the Whiffenpoofs? What the hell is a Whiffenpoof? It's an a capella singing group that's all male until I get there.
I'm gonna go check my test scores.
I love tests! Wow! Okay.
[laughs] Ooh, yes! I think I did pretty good too.
There's a whole other page.
[gasps] Oh, my God! It's like, even if I finished every single one of them [breathes heavily] I would still fail.
Just relax.
[exhales deeply] [types] [lute music playing] [phone buzzes] [lute music continues] - [lute music stops] - Come on! [crying softly] [laughs] No.
Oh, right.
She worries too much about their health.
Ah! Who fed this baby so much? [breathes heavily] [sighs] Oh, God! So stupid! Aw! He's so cute.
He looks like a little anchorman from the '70s.
Okay.
[door opens] Hola.
All right, just doing my final check-in.
- Brought the Wet Wipes.
- Okay.
So, you okay now? All right, nowÂ just remember.
All this hard work, everything you're juggling right now, - it's leading to great things.
- [sniffles] Don't quit before the miracle happens.
And hey, I'm always here for you.
[all] Aw! Now I wanna bone him.
So all this is forever? What a scam! [laughs] Listen, you guys have made a lot of progress.
I mean, it's been two years since Ramona set anything on fire.
[all cheer] And remember, anxiety is always rooted in something, and it tends to run in families.
Oh! [laughs] Believe me, I know exactly where I got it from.
- Lupita! - QuÃ©? Remember we went to the park last weekend, and there were so many mosquitoes swarming everywhere? I think they had the Zikas.
And now, we have the Zikas.
Oh, okay, Mami, good night.
No, no! Pero Elena bumped her head on a kitchen cabinet, un tremendo cocotaso.
I went to check on her.
Her breathing is relaxed.
Too relaxed.
SueÃ±a con los angelitos.
[sighs] Ay! Now, I gotta go check on Elena's breathing.
Siri, Google Zika symptoms.
Wait, that was at what time? Like, 4:00 a.
m.
It certainly helped you.
Oh, believe me.
I've tried, but she always tells me that I should pray instead.
Hey, prayer works.
I always get a good parking space.
You know, prayer works for her.
And in a way, it works for me too.
[Lydia] Hola, Dios.
Give Lupita a little extra help.
You know that Berto and I came to this country in search of freedom and for our children to pursue their dreams.
And Lupita is doing this.
I am so proud of her.
Obviously, I cannot tell her.
Otherwise, she will get lazy.
Pero please, give her all the strength she needs to achieve her dream.
You do this, and we will finally be even.
I know.
She's great, except when sheÂ describes me being on antidepressants as[imitates Lydia] the great family shame.
Well, at least you can be a better example for your kids.
Oh, no, they don't know about my great shame.
Hold on.
What? They don't know you have anxiety and depression? No, I don't wanna freak them out like that.
They're babies.
Oh, yeah, what's Elena now? Two hundred and four months? They're so cute when they start driving.
I get it.
But I have the weight of this whole family on my shoulders, and I needÂ them to believeÂ that they're being raised by a stable person.
Wait, Penelope.
Having anxiety and depression does not make you an unstable person, but it can be hereditary.
Elena or Alex could be exhibiting signs, and it often starts around puberty.
Ay, puberty! Between pimples, and the horniness, and suddenly sprouting a mustache, and I can only imagine what Alex is going through.
And if Alex or Elena are exhibiting signs of anxiety or depression, they might not want to open up to you about it.
Okay, you know what? Let's just leave my kids out of this, okay? They need to know you're human.
That's my job, right? I don't bring stress.
I take away stress.
And I have a very calming energy, and I make everyone around me very happy, okay? Okay.
[timer buzzes] Pencils down! I was writing a thank-you note.
I'm sorry.
I'm in test mode.
[chuckles] I just really need to step it up if I want to get into Yale.
Can you get early admission, like, now? Hello, everybody.
Everything is great.
She seem a little weird to you? Yeah.
She's probably just worried about how you wanna bankrupt the family by going to Yale.
Don't worry, Papito.
She will never get into Yale.
[Penelope] Yale again? Come on.
You know we can't afford it.
And, frankly, you trying to put the family under that kind of financial stress is really selfish.
What's going on? What's happening? Look at me.
Okay, stop.
Breathe.
[breathes deeply] [Penelope] Okay.
You're home, right? You're safe.
Look at me.
Just breathe.
[breathes deeply] [Penelope] You're okay, all right? Look at this.
- Look, a dog with a wig.
- [both chuckle] Oh! [sighs heavily] You okay? Yeah, that was weird.
I'm sorry.
I just get really stressed out sometimes.
Has that happened before? Couple of times, yeah.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Nothing.
Nothing is wrong with you, okay? That was an anxiety attack, and I know because I get them too.
Are you okay? Are you not happy? Oh, honey, it has nothing to do with unhappiness.
It's a chemical imbalance, and it runs in our family.
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Even though I'm ashamed of it.
But that's something I'm trying to end with me, 'cause I'm fine now.
And you're gonna be fine too.
Wait.
Is this why you freak out on me all the time? No, that's me being legit mad at you 'cause you're a punk.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
Well, I haven't felt anything like that.
Good.
That's so good.
But if you ever do, we're here for you.
And if you need to see someone, we'll do that.
Okay.
Thanks.
Ooh.
Happy you're both okay, but, um, I'm gonna go do the thing that grounds me, looking in the mirror.
- I would love to meditate with you.
- Yes! I am so stoked to be calm, and I'm goingÂ to kill at meditation so hard.
I'm gonna be like, "What you looking at, Buddha?" Ooh, yeah.
You really need this.
Om.
Om.
A sweet slice of orange for my sweet papito.
Really, Mami? If you always do everything for him, he'll never be able to do anything for himself.
- I'm fine with that.
- I'm fine with that.
Come on, Lupita.
Life has been torture for Papito since he has been imprisoned.
Grounded.
Imprisoned in this house.
I need to learn my lesson.
How you doing with that list of chores I gave you? I'm almost done with all of them.
You're still working on this? We have eight more units to get through.
The green wire is extra.
Don't need to connect it to anything.
Isn't that the wire that trips the breaker if there's a power surge? Carry on.
Why you so stressed? Your aromatherapist out ofÂ town? Well, that's not helping, but no.
I'm worried about Father's visit.
No, that's my Uncle Doug.
God! Father's visit is stressing me oot! I haven't seen him since before I got sober.
Haven't you been sober for, like, eight years? Yeah, I'm not his favorite child.
Plus, he refused to come back to America till it was great again.
I have a feeling your father's going to make me want to take my earrings out and punch him in the throat.
Oh, definitely.
But please just roll with it.
All I want is to get through this and give him as little as possible to criticize.
You made me patch up the drywall 'cause you had just gotten a manicure.
Father says you can tell the quality of a man by the health of his cuticles.
A real man does not know what a cuticle is.
Anyway, I think he'll like the building, but my real ace in the hole is Avery.
He'll love her 'cause she's rich and beautiful, but he won't want to date her because she's over 30.
Oh, and please don't make fun of me when he calls me by my childhood nickname, Goldie, short for Golden Boy.
That's actually kind of sweet.
I was a bed-wetter.
We will spend the day together in the laundry room like besties.
Yeah, I'm excited too.
What happened to me? [knocking on door] Since when do you knock and dress like American Psycho? I always knock.
I'm the landlord.
It's a courtesy.
[groans] Did you join a cult again? Everyone, I'd like you to meet my father, Lawrence Fitzgerald Schneider.
Very nice to finally meet you.
You must be Avery.
This is my tenant, Penelope.
Oh.
Thank god.
Encantada.
Ah, una EspaÃ±ola.
Mucho gusto en conocerla.
Your Spanish is very good.
Escobar was an old friend.
Nice suit.
Oh, thank you.
A little boy like you made it for me.
So this is what a typical unit looks like, huh? Much better.
Looks like you two were about to check out our new, top-of-the-line laundry room.
Run along now.
And don't give me that rent late.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Remember? But this is Don Julio Real.
He's got his own house.
It's still alcohol.
[knocking on door] Ooh, this must be Avery.
You're gonna love her.
Now that's more like it.
Ah! Mr.
Schneider, - it's such a pleasure to meet you.
Oh, dear! Was he orchestrating The Cremation of Care? As ever.
[chuckles] And we were also dueling skippers at the Mackinac Regatta.
Ah! Daddy once lost a Mackinac wager when his forestay snapped and his catamaran tacked starboard.
Ironically, it cost him his holdings in Pingtang! [both laugh] What the hell? - Shall we? - Yeah.
Was that even English? No, that was cha-ching-lish.
Oh, what happened? Everything is so different.
Yeah, they replaced the old machines that shook so hard they moved across the room.
Pero that's how I knew that the spin cycle was over.
[giggles] [dryer plays tune] Schneider programmed them to play different songs when they're done.
Don't quit your day job, dryer.
Okay, and where do I put the quarters? You pay with your phone.
So dumb! [Alex chuckles] You'll get used to it, Abuelita.
Remember when you thought rays from the microwave would give Elena chest hair? We shall see.
Ay, your mother never empties her pockets.
Y quÃ© es esto? UhLooks like a pen set and some catnip.
[gasps] Dios mÃ­o! It is las drogas.
No, no, no, it is the vape.
I have seen it many times on Caso Cerrado.
[gasps] Alex! Your mami is addicted to the weeds.
Oh! Yes! [gasps] Mami! [sobs] Oh, hey, I was just showing Father the new sconces.
Oh! Did you try to pull on it to open up the secret entrance to the treasure room? [chuckles] That's all Bluetooth now.
But this is all very nice.
Impressive renovations, and you did it with your cuticles intact like a man.
I'm proud of you.
[gasps] You've never called me son before.
You finally earned it.
[phone buzzes] It's Dick Cheney! Hey, what's cracking, you old queen? Wow! He was almost not awful.
I know! And he loves the building.
[gasps] What did he like? The tankless water heater, the new mailbox hardware? Tell me everything.
He was very impressed with all your hard work.
You told him you did everythingÂ yourself, didn't you? He's my daddy! Plus, he loved Avery.
And not in the bad way.
How is that a compliment? Well, the first wife is for breeding, the second is for spite, the third is to forget the second, the fifth is 30 years younger so it circles back to breeding, and of course, traditionally, the fourth wife'sÂ Asian.
I'm I'm just so tired.
Anyway, Father said it was ingenious that I picked the neighborhood when I did, because property values have gone through the roof.
That's not a great thing, Schneider.
It's gentrification.
No! This isn't gentrification.
That's bad.
This is good.
That's the best news of all.
You won't be paying rent anymore, because - we're going condo! - What? Condo-leezza Rice! Wa-condo forever! My condo Well, that one doesn't work, but we're going condo! We are going condo Condo, condo, condo Why is no one else dancing? You guys dance when the mail comes.
Are you serious? Oh, my God! I did this.
All of my work contributed to gentrification.
I'm the white devil! I thought you were just trying to get through this.
Now you're selling the building? What happened? I know, but Father and I got to talking, and he said a lot of things that made sense, and then he said this is something that we could work on together.
I've been waiting for this my entire life.
Well, a bunch of hard-working families are gonna be out on the street.
You can own your own home, but the monthly payments will be the same.
I don't have enough money for a down payment.
I buy Target furniture! From Goodwill! Just get one of those loans where you don't have to put anything down and youÂ only pay interest.
You mean the loans that broke America? When was this? Wow! Look, you're a veteran.
Can't you get a special loan? Or don't they, like, give you houses? They should give you houses.
You have no idea how the world actually works.
This is really gonna affect us.
But you obviously don't care.
Right.
You know, you can learn Spanish.
You can eat dinner with us.
You can pretend you're part of theÂ family.
But when it comes down to it, you are still the man and we're just your tenants.
Come on, Penelope.
That's not at all No, congratulations.
You are your father's son.
Please, get out.
[exhales] I cannot believe that Lupe is on the wacky weed.
Get me a fried egg so I can show her what a brain looks like on drugs! I am never going to stop yelling at her! Oryou can say nothing.
[sighs exasperatedly] Quiet mad.
That's the worst kind of mad.
Si.
A silent Cuban is the deadliest of Cubans.
But first I yell! And I give her such a pow pow! Abuelita, it's mine.
Is this why you have been grounded? Yeah.
Mami has been hiding it from you because I asked her to.
I just didn't want to let you down.
I'm so sorry, Abuelita.
Abuelita, say something.
[sighs] Thanks again for going through all my stuff on such short notice.
You can account on me, 'cause I'm an accountant.
That used to be on my business card.
[sighs] I'm feeling kind of vulnerable showing you all my finances.
That's, like, 12th base.
Twelfth base? You're either really bad at baseball or really good at sex.
Okay, Mateo, focus.
Can I afford to buy this place? [Mateo exhales] I'm sorry, but even with your VA benefits, you'll be stretched pretty thin.
Especially with Elena going off to college next year.
Great.
We can't afford to live in Echo Park without rent control, which means we'reÂ gonna have to move, the kids are gonna have to switch schools, and I'll have a six-hour commute.
Penelope, calm down.
You're actually in pretty good shape.
You can still afford to live in LA.
Let's take a look at your expenses.
Do you always see yourself living with your mother? Come on.
You really gotta ask me that? We're Latinos.
She lives with me.
I'll live with the Elena.
Plus, jail would be a free place to live.
Look, I get why you're mad.
But you see how much this neighborhood has changed and I see how little rent you pay.
Has Schneider ever raised your rent? Not since we moved in.
You've been paying the same rent for 17 years? He's a saint.
But yeah, screw that guy.
Let's kill him.
Well, I took down the man.
Okay! Abuelita, say something.
Anything! Tell me one of your stories.
Here, I'll even get you started.
[imitating Lydia] Havana, 1952 How can I make this better? I'll do anything.
I'll clean the house every day.
I'll let you pick out all my clothes.
I'll even shave my head.
[gasps] Ay, no.
I am very disappointed in you.
I'm really sorry, Abuelita.
It was a mistake.
And I'll never do it again.
I did it too.
What? The marijuana.
I, too, rode the green dragon.
Oh! Is that why you were staring at the dryer? No, I accidentally ate one of Leslie's pot lozenges, and I became very Como se dice? lit.
And it was stupid.
And we must promise each other that we will never ever, ever, ever toss the devil's salad again.
We need to work on your slang, Abuelita.
But okay.
[sniffles] Don't cry.
- I said I'll never do it again.
- No, no, it's not that.
This is the first time you have ever kept a secret from me, and we don't do that.
- I will take that to my grave.
- Ay.
Thank you.
[sighs] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to keep things from you.
I just didn't want you to hate me.
Ay, Papito! I could never.
You are mi vida.
- Yes, I will.
- Yeah? I love hanging out with you.
Especially now that I know we can get stoned together.
[knocking on door] Hey.
Hey.
Come on in.
Sorry I kicked you out before.
But it's nice to know that you're actually capable of leaving my apartment when asked.
No, I'm sorry.
You caught me off guard.
This is your building.
And it is a good business decision.
And hell, if the shoe was on the other foot, I'd have kicked your ass out too.
Thanks.
[Schneider sighs] I can't expect you to push your father away because of us.
And I get it.
And so are we.
[sighs] Great.
But I gotta say.
I don't think you should try so hard to become the man your father wants you to be.
Because I like the man you are just fine.
[Schneider sighs] What? Mar-a-Lago? But won't you be busy? [laughs] I'm kidding.
Okay, see ya.
Just got an appraisal on the units.
- What? - What? I really like everything the way it is.
You're screwing up the one thing you've done right in the last 20 years.
Well, this building is full of people I care about, and who care about me, and I don't want to screw that up.
Plus, I have enough money.
Enough money? I sent you to school in America so you could forget that polite, Canadian crap and learn some decent values.
My mind is made up.
This is incredible! I've given you everything and you've been a constant disappointment.
I put you through rehab three times.
I don't remember you ever once saying you loved me.
Oh, really? So this is about a little boy who's sad because Daddy never said I love you? Grow up, Goldie.
You know what? I'm officially done trying with you.
Then we have something in common.
Now get out of my building.
Gladly.
[door slams] That was freaking amazing! Where did that come from? Thanks.
[stammers] It felt amazing.
Yeah, I did.
Family's everything.
[Penelope sighs] Hey, you want to come over for dinner? You can invite Avery, and I'll even get out the good cookies that Mami and Alex hide in the oatmeal tin.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll be right down.
- I justI just need a minute.
- Okay.
Oh, my god! We're staying! You're not gonna raise the rent, right? You know what?Â We're gonna talk about that later.
[sighs] [theme music playing]
 Alex, your papi will be here any minute.
So get off your butt, turn all the pillows to their good side, and hide the ugly one in the closet.
Why are we cleaning for Papi anyway? We're cleaning for his new girlfriend.
And there's no way I'm gonna let that woman think that we live like sucios.
I cleaned under the bathroom sink.
So Papi's girlfriend will be impressed if she decides to steal a tampon.
So, what is the deal with your papi? I'm here for you, mija.
II'm a little nervous to see him, but he says he's sober, and he says he's okay with me being gay.
You never know with him, so keep one hand under the table just in case.
And, Lupe, this new novia, am I pulling her hair? Am I spitting in her cafÃ©? It's fine.
You know, I'm happy for him.
She's probably blonde and thin and really excited to graduate college.
[knocking on door] [Penelope] Oh, here we go.
All right, everybody, let's all be nice to the Instagram model we'll probably never see again, okay? - Hey! - Papi! Hey, wow! Looking good, Lupe.
- Thank you.
Hey.
Ugly pillow in the closet? You know it.
So, you look good too.
Where'suh, Baby? I mean, Blondie.
I mean, your girlfriend.
Hey.
[chuckles] [both] Hi! [laughs] Oh, wow! Dang! Papi's got a type.
- Uh, come in.
- I love your hair.
- Oh, I love your hair.
Is that a ring? Uh, well, um, I thought we had a few more minutes of small talk before we got there, but, um, yeah.
Nicole is my fiancÃ©e.
- Surprise! [chuckles] - [exclaims] [grunts] [pants] I don't have it.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Thank you for being so welcoming.
I know it must be awkward, Victor coming by with his new fiancÃ©e.
You think? It's not awkward.
[stammering] Listen, I am sorry.
I just didn't want to introduce you until things got really serious, but then they got really serious really fast.
Alex, I am so excited to meet you.
You're even more handsome in person than you are in photos.
All right! Welcome to the family.
And, Elena, your papi has told me so much about you.
Just so I know, what are your preferred pronouns? Oh! Well, my pronouns are she and her, and Syd, my significant other, identifies as they.
Thank you for asking.
[in unison] Okay.
My little sister, Mia, identifies as queer, and she's teaching me how to be an ally so I can pass it on to my students.
- Oh, you're a teacher? - Yeah.
I'm a special education teacher at an elementary school.
Isn't she amazing? Yeah, and age-appropriate.
Nothing to hate.
[laughs] [chuckles] Did you think I was going to be some young, blonde flaquita? [laughs] This is gonna put me in therapy.
[door opens] - Hey, Pen.
Wait.
What? Hey, Schneider, uh, this is my fiancÃ©e, Nicole.
What? FiancÃ©e? That's great.
- Wait.
Am I mad about this? - All good.
- Locked it down, dawg! - Yeah.
- So, you got a best man yet? - Uh, no, no.
What's with the arms? You don't have a lot of friends in LA, so obviously, I'm your best man.
[chuckles] No, no, I don't need any of that.
Nicole's friends are throwing her a little bachelorette thing, and I'm just gonna take Elena and Alex to dinner.
A dad-chelor party! [laughs] I could work with that.
I'll go get my cargo shorts and braided belt.
[door closes] Does he understand he's not invited? Not since I've known him.
Well, we should get going.
It was so lovely to meet you.
It was so great to meet you.
- Mucho gusto.
- [Lydia] Nice to meet you.
- [Penelope] Have a good time.
[Lydia] Hey, listen, don't be a stranger.
[chuckles] I can't stand her! Mami, she's fine.
But who is she trying to fool with that sexy laugh? Ay, paquete! The whole situation is very, very fishy.
Well, he's marrying his rebound, so [scoffs] And you have had more rebounds.
As I heard it on the SportsCenter, whoever has the most rebounds wins.
He is so sweet.
He's been texting me all morning.
I gotta text him back.
I don't know.
Something is off with Victor.
- It's too quick.
- Hmm.
I am going to keep an eye on him and his new bae.
But let's not get all worked up about Nicole and Victor.
They're going on with their lives, and we should go on with ours.
I'm so freaking mad! I'm the one that turned that mess into that sexy hyena's dream man.
I get that you're upset, Penelope, but I think the group is having a hard time following you.
Her ex got his crap together, and now, he's engaged to a woman named Nicole.
Keep up, Pam.
- [sighs] - So, he went from a Penny to a Nicole? [all laughing] - That's funny.
- Shut up! This sucks! Why do you think this is so activating? Is there a part of you that imagined you and Victor would get back together? Hell no, Pam.
You fed him, bathed him, busted your butt to get him healthy.
Then that dog up and ran away.
A few years later, you're watching a dog show, and guess who won the blue ribbon? That damn mutt you saved! You trained that dog.
You deserve that ribbon, and that dog should die alone.
I'm not sure that's the healthiest response.
You should have had him neutered.
- Exactly.
- Yes.
- [scoffs] It's not fair! You know, he's moving on, and I've got no one.
What about Mateo? Right, that guy.
I gotta text him back.
It's clear that this encounter has triggered some insecurities.
I recommend some quiet time alone so that you can really process these feelings.
I'm getting over this tonight! [all] Whoo! As the front-runner for best man, I got you a little something for your dad-chelor party.
Bam! "V.
A.
I'll wear it.
[cawing] Lydia, what are you doing here? I need you to invite me to the party so I can spy on Victor.
I think I think he's drinking again.
What? No, that's crazy.
He's sober.
He wouldn't drink.
No, I don't think he's sober anymore.
When he drinks, he's impulsive and irrational, and that is why he is rushing into a marriage with dollar-store Lupita.
Sure, he's had his hard days.
I know that better than anybody.
But he's committed.
He has too much to lose.
I'm just worried about the children.
I don't want to see them hurt again.
Y por eso, I must watch his every move.
But what if he sneaks off to the bar? I recruited a spy.
B.
Don't say my name.
Tonight, I am undercover.
Another mudslide, Mr.
Iglesias? Si, seÃ±or.
And keep them coming.
- [sighs] - Look who I found.
[laughs] She's my plus-one.
Wouldn't be a dad-chelor party without my ex-wife's mother.
What are you wearing? [gasps] "VAG"? Oh! Victor Alvarez Guapisimo.
I want one.
Seriously? A special ed teacher? The one thing you can't make fun of? She did that on purpose.
Another round, ladies? - Sorry.
Our Uber's here.
- Ugh! Bye.
- [whines] - [Jill] I'm out too.
I'm staying.
Oh, yes! Ramona, my ride or die! Hey, have a seat.
Two more, please.
[Penelope] You know, maybe Pam was onto something.
Like, maybe III am hung up on this because I'm insecure about where I'm at in my life.
But you got no reason to be, though.
You're raising two smart kids.
You got a boyfriend blowing up your phone.
You're about to be a nurse practitioner.
And your body is tight! I'm telling you, lady, if you were gay, and my knees weren't arthritic I would get down there Whoa! What? Propose to you.
Ew! Get your mind out of the gutter! But how drunk are you? [both laughing] Seriously, Penny, forget Nickel.
You are the baddest bitch in here.
It's my bachelorette party, and I'm the baddest bitch in here! [all] Whoo! I know that this is all happening really quick, so I wanted to talk to you guys.
Oh, yes, tell us.
Yeah, let's crack that egg open and get right to the yolk.
[sighs] Uh, well I was thinking it would be, uh, just me and the kids, but, umokay.
Papi, before I answer, I need to know something.
Does your hotel have a pool? [sighs, chuckles] Yes.
Then I'm in.
So[chuckles] Nicole is from Portland, huh? I hear they have a huge LGBTQ+ community.
Oh, yeah, they have a parade, like, every week.
[scoffs] Oh, is that a bad thing? No.
No.
I I mean, when I'm trying to get to work, it is, but, uh, well, that would be true of aof a straight parade.
[clears throat] Anyway, Nicole's sister, Mia, she goes to them all the time.
Oh, so, you're cool with her.
Did you go to her quinces? Why don't you use this awkward moment to refresh my rum and Coke? It is weaker than a woman who claims that childbirth is painful.
Okay.
What a gentleman, huh? I gotta go to the bathroom.
If there's gonna be a big, dramatic scene, wait till I get back.
Of course.
I can't flip this table by myself.
I also like a rum and Coke-caine.
Excuse me? Oh, I was just saying how much I enjoy the occasional soda, especiallywith a little happy juice.
- UhHey.
- Oh! Cheers.
- Oh.
Okay.
Uh - [laughs] Thank you.
Thanks.
It's not like I'm some honey trap.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you okay? You're looking a little, uh, unsteady there, buddy.
Says the guy with three heads.
Wow.
You know, I've been there.
Listen, ifif you ever want to quit, give me a call.
I'll save a seat for you.
Yeah.
[all cheering] You know what me and her ending up at the same bar is? A beatdown waiting to happen.
I know a lawyer who can make it look like she started it.
- Want me to hook it up? - No! It's a sign.
I need to tell Nicole the truth about the man she's gonna marry.
Yeah, I don't think Hey, girl.
Penelope.
Uh, everyone, this is Victor's ex-wife.
[all] Oh! I know.
Be a unicorn with me.
- [slurring] Right, but we do need to talk.
- Yes, yes.
Yeah.
Before you say anything, can I just say thank you? For what? For being an amazing woman who pushed Victor to be the man he is today.
He told me every horrible thing he put your through when he was at his lowest, and the fact that you had the strength to leave him so that he could realize that he needed to get help, and how you managed to salvage the relationship between him and your kids.
[sighs] Girl! [laughing] Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.
I'm sorry for interrupting.
[in unison] We're so beautiful! [both laughing] [both sigh] [sniffling] I came here tonight to get drunk and forget about you and Victor.
And it's not because I'm not over him.
I am.
I cried for months until I had no tears left.
But I became whole again.
And I love the life I've built as a single mom.
But selfishly, I want him to be miserable.
And I totally get that.
Perfect.
[laughs] Oh! Victor's not perfect.
But I love him.
He makes me laugh.
He makes me feel safe.
When I think about something bad happening to him I get so upset.
[laughs] I just can't picture my life without him.
I mean, it's inevitable.
[sighs] I'm sorry.
[laughs] This isn't helping you feel better, is it? No.
But I know what you mean.
You're marrying the love of your life, and that's really special.
Victor tells me that you are dating a really sweet guy, Mateo.
Right.
That guy.
[laughs] I gotta text him back.
Unless it's at the end of September.
Early spring's no good either.
Oh, and I'd love to keep my summer open.
Why don't I just send you some dates? Alex, Elena? Can I count on you two being there? Papi, I'll come to all of your weddings if you come to all of mine.
Oh, my God.
Wellgreat.
[chuckles] Elena? I want to lay down some ground rules.
I'm not gonna hide the fact that I'm gay.
No.
No, absolutely not.
I knew it.
This is all a show, but you are never gonna be okay with who I am.
Elena, you can't wear the white suit because you need to wear a tuxedo.
What? I want you and Alex to be my best man and my best woman.
Best people.
I mean, if Elena's cool with it.
[chuckles] This is so sweet.
Nepotism.
Victor, what a lovely gesture! Thank you.
Thank you, Lydia.
I'm really happy with my life now.
Turns out this whole not drinking thing is good for me.
I never doubted you.
Feeling horny? Oh! [laughs] I'm sorry I was ignoring your texts.
No, but Now.
Let's talk now, yeah? Okay.
Well, what I wanted to say is I started talking to my ex-wife again, and we decided to give it another shot.
Oh.
Oh, man! I know.
No, it's because I was coming over to break up with you.
What? See, it's like this, Mateo.
When I think about something bad happening to you, II don't get upset.
Sick burn! IThat's not how I meant it.
[sighs] I think you're great.
And I care about you.
But what we havehad It's nice, but it's not Yeah.
Anyway, I'm glad that we're both on the same page.
This is good.
I know it might be weird at first but eventually, do you think we could be friends again? Of course.
On one condition.
- [TV turns off] Hey, how was it? Great.
I'm gonna be the best man, and Elena's gonna be the best woman at Papi's wedding.
I'm gonna rock a tux like Diddy at the Met Gala.
Ooh! And I'm gonna rock my tux like Jacques Dubochet.
He won a Nobel Prize for chemistry.
Hello! [laughing] Okay, that's great.
Mami, Dr.
Berkowitz called for you.
So, I guess things went well.
They did.
It was nice to have some quality time with the kids and your mother - and your landlord.
- Oh.
[chuckles] Not that you need it, but I totally approve of Nicole.
You really pulled your life together.
I'm happy for you.
Thank you.
Listen, I don't know exactly how to say this, so I'll just say it.
I don't want Schneider around the kids anymore.
What? Why not? He's drinking again.
And who knows what else? No.
No, no way! No, he's eight years sober.
He went to the bathroom four times, and he smelled like mouthwash.
I know all the tricks.
Look, I know he's your friend, but this is about the kids.
Mami, we need to talk.
Hold on.
I'm watching the President.
Oh, wait.
It is a hemorrhoid commercial.
Hold up.
I-I couldn't sleep last night because Victor told me he thinks Schneider fell off the wagon.
You know, my cousin Miguel fell off the wagon once.
- Mami, this is serious.
- Okay.
I haven'tÂ noticed any signs of Schneider slipping.
Have you? - Well, what are the signs? - Not showing up for work.
So he has been drunk for the last 20 years? All right, that's a good point.
Uh, spending money recklessly is another sign.
But this is the guy who, while sober, bought wax statues of Ice Cube, Ice-T, and Vanilla Ice.
Alcohol.
That was me.
Maybe we should go check in on him, because if he was drinking last night, he will be a hungover mess today.
[knock on door] What up, fam? Beautiful day.
Got up at 6:00.
Crushed a smoothie, went to goat yoga.
Ironically, the instructor had a camel toe.
Drunk, sober.
Who can tell? Yoga, huh? Let me ask you a question.
- Did you do this move? [glugs] What's that? Thirsty Warrior? Ach.
Are you using again? Booze, pills, sticky icky icky? What? Where's this coming from? Victor thinks you slipped.
Did you? Oh, my God.
I'm fine.
Addicts always think everyone's an addict, just like Elena thinks everyone's gay, and Lydia thinks everyone's in love with her.
Stop flirting with me and get to the point.
Schneider, you know we care about you, so I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Are you drinking? Okay, the truth is, I did think about having a drink when my dad was in town, but I didn't, and I promise you, I'm fine.
What? You saw him.
He's his normal self.
Oh, yeah? 'Cause before he came in, he knocked.
[wheezes] - [Gloria Estefan] This is it - Oh-oh-oh-oh This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball - This is it - Oh-oh-oh-oh Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight, we'll muddle through One day at a time - So, up on your feet - Patria.
Somewhere, there's music playin' Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time Yep.
One day at a time One day at a time [Gloria scatting in Spanish] One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time School zone? Reduce speed to under 25.
Yes.
Nun crossing the street? Do not hit her.
Why are you wearing your nicest shirt to the DMV? Because this place is jam-packed with 16-year-old girls with cars.
'Sup, girl? Sick Mazda.
Uhh.
You came here to hit on girls? You can't even go out with anybody.
You're still grounded.
Girls love what they can't have.
After you get your license, maybe you could drive me to the mall.
I need to get something for Lydia.
I should get her something.
I will drive you anywhere you want because you're the best teacher ever, and I am gonna crush this test.
[squeak] [car doors open and close] I should've hired a driving instructor instead of relying on a family friend.
Why did I waste so much time making flashcards? Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
- Relax? No.
I'm never gonna get my license.
I'm never gonna get a job.
I'm gonna live at home forever.
Then Syd is gonna leave me for a soft butch with a Subaru.
[breathes heavily] Okay, I think you're having an anxiety attack.
Here, sit down and just take a deep breath.
Think about something calming, like that Supreme Court lady you like Darth Vader Ginsburg.
- I can't.
If Elena fails, it'll all be my fault.
They always say, "If you can't do, teach.
" But if you can't teach, what is there? [both hyperventilate] Okay.
Man, I thought the DMV was gonna be fun.
- Lupita, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
- What? How are we going to play this? Who is the law? Who is the order? [imitates Law & Order theme] No.
Okay, Mami, let's spread out.
You go look in the cactus garden.
I'll check out the wax museum.
- Oh, Mami, look! - [squeals] Oh, deodorant.
Good.
I'm sweating.
No.
Mami, this is a fake can for hiding drugs.
You just twist it.
Ooh.
Uhh? Now I smell like a horny eighth-grader.
Oh, look.
A giant smoking bing-bong.
Mami, that's too big to be a bong.
I'm guessing.
[door opens] [both yelp] It's actually a didgeridoo.
Yeah, well, the figs were sub-par today, so I came home disappointed.
Now I'm even more disappointed to come home and find my best friend and her daughter sneaking into my apartment.
It is true.
I have violated the bro code.
You know what? I don't care.
Get mad at me all you want, okay? You're hiding something, and I'm gonna find out what it is.
Let me see if your pupils are dilated.
What? Stop.
- I just want you to be honest with me.
- I am.
I've never lied to you.
Other than once when I told you chartreuse was your color when really, it's nobody's color.
Look, I'm sensitive, okay? I've been through this before with Victor.
By the time I confronted him, it was too late.
Well, I'm not Victor.
I've always been there for this family.
Well, you should be.
Oh.
Ahh.
What is this? That's not my yoga mat.
Okay.
I screwed up.
- We should get ahold of your sponsor.
- You're right.
I'll text Nick right now.
I can't believe I let this happen.
Thanks, guys.
You probably saved my life by catching me before I hit bottom.
Okay, Nick's on his way.
Good, because we're not going anywhere until he gets here.
- Thank you, but you don't have to do that.
- No, we do.
There's a bottle of vodka in the freezer.
Wax Ice-T is full of Long Island Iced Tea.
[Lydia] Schneider, there is no iced tea in Ice-T.
[Penelope] Yeah, I don't see any vodka, Schneider.
Schneider! Oh, boy.
He sent us on a wild Grey Goose chase.
Okay.
Are you feeling better? Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I'm feeling better, too.
Well, you should.
You're gonna do great.
You're up.
Thanks, Alex.
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna make this test my bitch.
You can't say that.
Well, my work here is done.
Plus, I made a date with a girl who failed the test four times.
She needed a win.
Wait.
Wait.
I still need help with your grandmother's non-iversary gift.
Okay.
Well, the traditional gift for a first non-iversary is nothing, because that's not a thing.
That's private.
I can't look at that.
Without my reading glasses.
"Take a hot-air balloon ride.
" No can do.
I'm afraid.
- Heights? - Baskets.
Let's see.
" "Kiss the ugly Property Brother to make the handsome Property Brother jealous.
" [chuckles] This part of the list was after she had some rum.
"Buy more rum.
" I've got it.
There's one on here that I can make happen, and I know she'll love.
It's perfect.
Oh, I I can't let you see it.
It has to be a surprise.
I just want my phone back.
Oh.
Thank you.
Okay, let us know if you hear from him.
You're the person he's most likely to call in a crisis.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
Avery hasn't seen him? That was his almond milker.
iAi, que triste! Well, I-I-I checked with all our neighbors.
Nada.
[door opening] Mami, that's the kids.
Don't say anything.
I don't want them to get freaked out.
Okay.
So? What has two thumbs and a provisional driver's license to be used only betweenÂ the times of 5:00 a.
m.
with no passengers under the age of 20 without a licensed driver aged 25 or higher present? This guy! [laughter] Yay.
Congratulations.
I am so proud of you.
It was pretty intense.
I actually started to have an anxiety attack, but Alex helped me through it.
Really? It was nothing.
Â I knew what to do because of everything we talked about.
- [cell phone vibrates] - Ah, sorry.
How are they gonna get to me? No! I didn't think this through.
Don't worry.
I will find you an Uber.
Elena, your name is now Uber.
So much to celebrate.
Sparkling cider? Yep, and I sprung for the good stuff.
Ahh.
Martinelli's? Ooh, we're gonna party like slightly rebellious Mormons.
Why do you think it's chilled? [grunts] Alex.
No, I really couldn't have done this without you.
You were there for me andOw! Oh, my God! Oh, don't worry.
It's okay.
No, my shirt! I need to wash it before it stains.
[man] Ow! [groans] Schneider? Alex, hey, man.
Are you doing a load? 'Cause I think I threw up on my pants.
Oh.
- I thought you quit a long time ago.
- [sighs] Yeah, well, I recentlyquit quitting.
It's all right.
I'm just gonna go upstairs take a hot shower, and I'll be good as new.
Are you sure you're okay? - I think we should call somebody.
- No! I'm sorry.
I just It's not a big deal.
It's not gonna happen again, so don't tell your mom you found me down here.
So you get it? Yeah.
I do.
You did the right thing calling us.
Here, Schneider, I made you sopa de pollo.
And, uh, I got you a wet towel for your head.
I don't know if it actually works.
They just always did it on Nurse Jackie.
Thanks, guys.
We love you.
And you're gonna get through this.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and try to clean up.
Okay, Schneider, but you need a hug.
Heh heh.
Okay, he's clean.
Alex, I, uh It's all good.
- [door closes] Mom, I get it.
Cautionary tale.
Scared straight.
No, that's not what I wanted to say.
I am really proud of how you handled everything today.
You helped Elena through an anxiety attack.
Dr.
Berkowitz called me and said you helped solve his biggest problem.
It takes a mature kid to know what to do when faced with something like that.
I guess I just realized he needed help more than he needed someone to keep his secret.
Well, you were right.
And that's why, as of ironically, 4:20 [chuckles] you are officially ungrounded.
Really? - Yeah.
- Yes! Now go out, have some fun and in an added plot twist ba-bam! Whoa.
A twenty-dollar bill? I saw these in a rap video once.
Thanks, Mom.
You're in luck.
I just squeaked by.
- [door closes] - [door opens] Thanks, you guys, for the soup and for understanding They're gone, so enough of the b.
s.
My son has to find you passed out in a laundry room? How long has this been going on? And tell me the fricking truth this time.
It actually did start when my dad was here.
You been lying to us for that long? What the hell, Schneider? I know.
It's justahh.
I was really good at one thing drinking.
I could always drink way more than everybody else.
It made me interesting and fun.
And when he was here, I had one drink.
And I actually managed to stand up to him.
So I started thinking, "Why does it have to be all or nothing? I can handle a drink now and then.
" But obviously, I can't.
What are you doing? I'm removing my eight-year chip.
You're never gonna trust me again.
You know the first time you asked me to take Alex to his baseball game was one of the proudest moments of my life.
Nobody ever asks the addict to do that kind of stuff.
But you did.
You're the only one who's ever trusted me, Pen.
All that goes away now.
It doesn't go away.
It's just gonna be hard to get back.
And now the thought of going back to a meeting and starting over? I can't do it.
Yes, of course you can.
And you will.
I'm not giving up on you.
None of us are.
If you don't start going back to meetings, you're just gonna keep slipping.
You want to be a good role model for the kids, right? This is your chance.
Someone once told me, "Don't quit before the miracle happens.
You did, dummy.
I just don't know if I can face those guys.
You don't have to do that alone.
Hi.
My name is Pat, andI'm an alcoholic.
- Hey, Pat.
- Hi, Pat.
Today is day one for me.
- Thanks, man.
I'm always here for you, even if I'm putting up 500 pounds on the bench or out with some model or on myÂ yacht playing D&D with the homies.
But next time, call your sponsor.
Before.
Yeah.
And I might call you, too.
For other reasons.
It was really cool of Victor to invite us to his wedding.
But, are you going to be okay? II mean, with all that alcohol around.
Oh.
Yeah.
Thirty days sober.
I'm starting to feel like myself again.
I just wish Avery was coming.
- You still haven't heard from her? - No.
I tried everything.
" But they spaced it wrong, so it just said, "I love a very sorry baby.
" Anyway, I think it's over.
It is never over.
There will be many single ladies at the wedding today, and I will find you the perfect match.
I even put it in my bouquet list.
Lydia, I don't want to sound too forward, but[purrs] [sighs] Do I look too perfect? I don't want to outshine the bride.
[laughs] Just kidding.
Yes, I do.
Anyway We still got a minute 'cause Mami is still gettingÂ ready.
How is she doing? Wellit's an unusual situation, and and she isHow do I say this? [Penelope shouts] Who took my pumice stone? - Flipping out.
- Mm-hmm.
So when she comes out, make sure to compliment how great she looks.
Am I on a runway in Milan right now? [purrs] Okay.
I get it, okay? Thank you.
Thank you, but you don't have to worry about me.
Yeah, I know that this is all a little weird, but I am going to be just fine.
Oh, like I'm in a hurry to cram myself into some Spanx so I can watch my ex-husband marry a less-cute me? Alex, where is her pumice stone? And remind me to thank your father for scheduling the weirdest day of my life right before my board exams.
I should be studying all day, but instead, I had to study all night.
So you didn't get any sleep? I didn't get any sleep! Now, I get to have 150 people look at me with pity and say to me, "Don't worry.
You'll find someone.
" - Oh, but you will find someone.
- Shut it! There are only two kinds of people that go to their ex-husband's wedding, psychopaths and heroes.
Guess which one I am.
I'm a hero! Now, let's go! When she comes back in, nobody make eye contact.
No blood relation.
Go for it,Â baby.
Look at this.
Two minutes in, and he's already found someone.
[laughs] And you will too.
You're so brave to be here.
Thank you.
This is actually really nice.
- I'm glad I came.
Everyone was so worried I wouldn't be able to handle this, but I'm doing just fine.
["Bridal Chorus" playing] Oh, no! Hola, Lupe.
You look very nice.
Thank you, Papi.
What's happening? Obviously, you are having a moment of self-reflection.
You imagine yourself as the bride at your ex-husband's wedding.
Totally normal.
Let's figure out what's troubling you, mija.
- Are you still in love with Victor? - What? No! I thought he was the love of my life, but no, he's not.
Hmm.
So, you're worried that you may not find the love of your life? I don't know.
Maybe.
Part of the problem is that Mami found you, and you set the bar too high.
It is true.
I am amazing.
Where's mine? Mijita.
You know the answer already.
No.
Don't give me that it's-all-inside-me caca.
Just tell me what to do.
- And do you, Penelope, take Victor? - [laughs] No, thank you.
I'm really happy for you and Nicole.
Pa Papi? You may kiss the bride.
- [sighs] I know.
I can't stop thinking about Avery.
I gotta move on, but it's hard.
Well, of course.
It takes time to heal.
Leslie, it's go-time.
Wait.
What? This is Anna-Maria.
Ugh! Fine.
Let the sparks fly! Lydia, there's something on your bouquet list that I can help you check off, something big.
Oh, Leslie[gasps]what is it? I'm taking you to Cuba.
Was that a Cuban way of saying thank you? Leslie, I am so sorry.
My body rejects even theÂ idea of setting foot in Cuba.
While I would love it more than anything, it would be too painful to return.
But on your bouquet list, you say, "Spread Berto's ashes in Cuba.
" Clearly, what I meant was go to Miami, find a pier, wait until sundown, play Berto's favorite song, and then spread the ashes on the ocean, so he can find his way back to Cuba.
Hmm.
But I really want to do something for you.
[Lydia] Oh! What about this? Can I take you to Miami? Leslie, that is so sweet.
[gasps] We can even stay together.
Different rooms, but the same hotel this time.
Hot dog! I am booking the flights.
No, Leslie.
The same flight.
There is still so much left to do.
Well, let's get to it.
What's next? A tattoo? What's the matter? You nervous about your toast? Just picture everyone naked, except for TÃ­o Frank.
He has a nipple on his elbow.
[both] Ugh! No, I just I feel a little weird being in a suit in front of all these people, and I'm just having some flashbacks.
[sighs] I mean, everybody seems cool, but a lot of them were at my quinces, and some of them probably feel the same way Papi does.
The way Papi did.
That was two years ago.
No, you don't.
Shut up.
I shave it.
[DJ] Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, Mr.
and Mrs.
Victor Alvarez.
- [crowd applauds] - [upbeat music playing] Not the first time ever, but I'm gonna let that go.
[camera shutters clicking] I don't understand what happened with this one.
[shutter clicks] But there was just no spark.
Lupe, it is time I was completely honest with you.
Everyone thinks your mami and I were so passionate, but the truth is, we had sex strictly for procreation.
Nice try, Papi.
[laughs] I know.
I could barely get through it.
Are you sure? Maybe with a little time love could blossom.
He could be your happy ending.
- See, Papi? That felt right.
- [shutter clicks] And you're gone again.
[shutter clicks] Don't worry.
I started a rumor that her tatas are fake.
Pass it along.
And as a wise man once said, "Love is the three-point shot you should always take.
" It was me.
And congrats on nothing but net, Papi, to you and Nicole.
[clears throat] When I was little, uh, my papi would braid my hair and watchÂ Disney movies with me over and over again without complaining.
So he's a hero.
- [crowd laughs] - [Elena laughs] No, really, people like to throw that word around, but my dadÂ joined the Army out of a selfless need to protect the people that he loved.
And he's not only a hero because he gaveÂ years of his life to this country, or because he knows all the choreography to High School Musical.
That's right.
[laughs] My dad is a hero because, when his life was falling apart, he was able to put it back together, and in doing so, found love.
And I am so happy for you, Papi.
Congrats to you both.
I even got choked up, and it's hard to make a man with a mustache cry.
[scoffs] Why are you in here? Ugh! You're not putting S in front of all the "hes" in the Bible again, are you? I hated my toast.
What are you talking about? It was really nice.
I meant everything I said.
I just have more to say.
But it's his wedding, and I don't want to be a jerk.
Okay.
So how about you make the toast you wanted to make? Just do it for me.
[sighs] - Okay.
- Yeah.
[exhales deeply] Hi, everybody.
I'm Elena Alvarez.
You might remember me as the girl who was abandoned by her dad in the father-daughter dance of her quinces.
Hi.
How you doing? Nice to see you.
[sighs] Papi, I know you're trying.
[crying] I should not have to be doing all of the work.
[sniffling] The bigger person shouldn't have to be the kid.
Anyway, Nicole seems really nice.
Congrats.
[chuckles] It's good you did not make that your toast.
[laughs] - Do you feel better? - Yeah.
[Lydia] Thank you, Leslie.
Now, all the punks will know that I ride with Papito.
Heads up.
The potato salad has shrimp in it.
[Victor] Okay, everybody, if it's all right, I'd like to say something.
[sighs] Uh, Nicole and I are so happy that you all are here.
Um[sighs] My kids they said, um, a lot of nice things about me.
But, um they left out a bunch of stuff too.
There was a time when I was not in a good place.
And I left my family.
I believe I owe her a dance.
["De NiÃ±a a Mujer" playing] [laughs] [singing in Spanish] What? Are we not doing that this time? Carry on.
- All right, what's next? - Uh "Kiss AndyÂ GarcÃ­a.
" Well, that might be tough.
Oh, come on! It's a Cuban wedding in LA.
He is here.
I just have to find him.
[DJ] We have a special request.
You said "master a dance from another culture.
" Oh, you are right.
I swore I would never do this dance, because I have dignity.
But now, I'm an American, so hit it.
["The Chicken Dance" playing] Are you okay? Oh, no, I'm all kinds of messed up.
You? Seeing that father-daughter dance really made me happy, but if one moreÂ person tells me, "You'll find someone," I'm setting off the sprinklers, and we'reÂ gonna see who has extensions real quick.
[sighs] I can't get over Avery.
I had a magical angel woman who wanted a future with me, and I screwed it up.
A wedding probably isn't the best place for me right now.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Otherwise, I'd be the only single loser here, so [laughs] - Avery? - [Penelope] Huh? Don't worry.
You'll find someone.
["The Chicken Dance" continues] ["The Chicken Dance" ends] [soft song playing] Oh, thank god! [laughs] Hi.
Hi.
I can't believe you're here.
Wait.
[chuckles] Apparently, you're an Alvarez now.
She said that? [Avery] Yeah.
That's why I'm here.
She really said that about me being an Alvarez? - Yeah, let's focus on me.
- Right.
Ooh, yeah, nights are so lonely I am so sorry.
And I don't know if there's anything I can say to make up for what I put youÂ through.
How are you doing? Well, 30 days without alcohol was hard.
[laughs] I'm a little scared.
But I'm really glad I'm here too.
I tried to understand the reason why And now I know it's all All because I love you I love you so much Lydia.
I would like you to meet Andy GarcÃ­a.
Leslie, did you really not know who AndyÂ GarcÃ­a is? - Is this the end of our friendship? - No, no, this isÂ AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a.
He is not the star of Geostorm, but he is a podiatrist from Glendale.
Ay, quÃ© sweet! [laughs] The real, handsome, charming AndyÂ GarcÃ­a was not available, so you found me whatever this is.
[DJ] Okay, it's the last song of the night.
Papi? Hey, you.
Okay.
Are you really here? Yeah, Victor invited everyone from the unit.
I was late.
I just got off a shift, but I can't believe you're here.
- Kind of a hero.
- Right? Thank you! So, um you want to dance, or you just want to keep poking me? I thought about you a lot this last year.
Me too.
Turns out watching your ex-husband get married is not as fun as it sounds.
[laughs] Yeah, my ex recently married that contractor.
- [clicks tongue] I did not go.
- [laughs] And I may have left a rude comment in the online guestbook.
- Hey, your NP boards are coming up, huh? - Yeah.
Next week.
[sighs] I'm running on no sleep and no confidence.
Oh, please! You're gonna crush it.
[upbeat music playing] Take care of yourself, Max.
You too.
Okay.
I know I sound like a broken record, but that one anda, Lupe, he makes AndyÂ GarcÃ­a look like a podiatrist from Glendale.
[laughs] I know.
He was very much in love with you.
And I was in love with him.
I don't understand.
And I have no regrets.
So, mi niÃ±a, what is your happy ending? Maybe I'm not meant to have a great love like you and Mami.
Maybe I'll have many.
Maybe I won't.
But if there's one thing that I've learned today, it's that I look damn good in white.
[laughs] I'm so proud to be with you on your special day, Lupita.
Te quiero.
[announcer] Penelope Alvarez.
Oh, I love the sound of that, but you can just shorten it to Penelope Francisca del Carmen Riera InclÃ¡n Ruiz Maribona de Alvarez, NP.
How was the flight? How's Miami? [Lydia] I don't know.
What? What do you mean, you don't know? I'm in Cuba.
