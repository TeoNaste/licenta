I've been great.
What about you?
Thank you very much.
How's it going?
I'm attending PCC right now.
Are you enjoying it there?
Everything's been good with you?
I haven't been better.
Thanks a lot.
It's an ugly day today.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot.
I know, you're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
It looks like it may rain soon.
Yes, and I hope that it does.
I really hope it rains today.
Yeah, me too.
Really?
Why?
The sky looks so clean after it rains.
I love it.
That sounds like fun.
What's the weather going to be like?
You're right.
One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
It sounds like it will be.
Predictable weather would make life easier.
It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.
Every day the weather seems different.
I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
I was cleaning up.
It's okay.
Hi, how are you.
Is Alice there?
What did you have in mind?
I was thinking about seeing a movie.
No problem.
Did you need something?
She's really pretty.
Describe her to me.
There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?
I haven't seen her yet.
Are you telling me that you've seen her before?
I believe so
She has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Do you want anything to make you feel better?
No, thanks.
I'm still feeling under the weather.
Would you like anything for your stomach?
I'm still feeling a little sick.
I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
You haven't told me anything yet.
I got a promotion at work earlier this week.
You deserved this promotion.
Is that what you really think?
I appreciate that.
You have no idea how happy I am for you.
It's really nice.
Thanks again. You look nice today, too.
You do?
I just bought this outfit a couple days ago.
Those are nice.
What are they?
What store did you get it from?
I went to Macy's and picked it out.
They only cost me about forty dollars.
I'm going to go get a pair for myself.
I see that you're pretty talented.
Thank you very much.
I first learned how to do it in high school.
Did you take some sort of art class or something?
Oh, you actually do that?
Every so often, I do.
They just need to find it.
What's your favorite movie?
I did.
Me too.
Honestly, it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
You're right. That movie is hilarious.
I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever.
You think so, how come?
I would love to.
What type of music do you like to listen to?
I enjoy listening to all kinds of music.
What kind?
I enjoy listening to both Rock and R&B.
What interests you in that type of music?
Our school did.
They played really well.
I'll make sure and make it to the next one.
Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game?
It was a great game.
What was the score at the end of the game?
Our team played hard and won.
I really wish I went to the game.
I'm going to the movies with a friend.
How about you?
Okay, sounds good.
Do you know what you're going to do this weekend?
Thank you for inviting me, but I think I'll pass.
All right. Another time then.
No good movies come to mind.
Have you decided whether or not you would like to go?
That would be nice, thank you.
No problem, you're welcome.
It's no trouble at all.
If you get sick, I'll return the favor.
Don't mention it.
When you miss a day of school, I'll be happy to give you the English assignments.
Well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
Oh my God, that's great!
I didn't know that.
I thought you knew.
I haven't heard anything.
Debrah had her baby last week.
I appreciate that.
Did you go to school today?
I really want to go to the movies this weekend.
So go then.
Maybe it was, but answer the question.
No, not recently.
That's nice, have you been to the movies lately?
No, but that was a random change of subject.
It's no problem. I was really missing you anyway.
I missed you too.
I am too.
I'm really glad that you came to see me.
Tell me what you've been doing.
Basically, I've been working too.
I've really been working a lot lately.
I've been pretty busy myself.
Well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today.
Yeah, so are you planning on going?
Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday?
I've heard about it, but I'm still waiting for my invitation.
It's supposed to start at about eight.
How many invitations has she given out?
Are you even going to go?
Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year.
I'm throwing a party on Friday.
I didn't realize that.
What's going on with you?
Fine. What's going on with you?
I hope that I'll see you there.
No doubt
What time does it start?
The party starts at 8.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Why not?
Oh, really?
You are coming?
Not a lot, what about you?
I'm having a party next Saturday.
I'm sorry.
What's up?
I'm going to dinner with my family.
I really wanted you to come, but I understand.
Do you think you can come?
I'm sorry.
Nothing really. How about you?
A lot, like the party I'm having on Friday.
I'll be there.
It was nice talking to you.
That's harsh.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
That's not nice.
I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now.
I'm not being nosey, it's just a question.
You don't need to worry about that.
I think we should go out to eat.
That sounds good.
I think that would be nice.
Is there anything you would like to do next time?
It was really nice talking to you also.
I think we should really do something sometime.
See you.
I'd like to reserve a hotel room.
Is that okay with you, Mr. Sandals?
How much per night are we talking about?
Your reservation is in our computer.
All we need now is a phone number.
Hi, Mr. Sandals.
I'm Michelle, at your service.
Great!
Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
It's area code 626-555-1739.
Thank you so much, Mr. Sandals.
I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th.
Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates.
Nonsmoking.
That'll be nonsmoking.
I need a hotel room.
That's no problem at all.
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision.
It'll be $308 nightly.
That would be 626-555-1739.
That's 626-555-1739.
Do you mind, sir?
Possibly. What's the actual price?
It's 626-555-1739.
Let me repeat that: 626-555-1739. Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you in April!
Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay.
Only $308 per night, before taxes, of course.
Now if you'll just give me your phone number.
Not a problem.
Thank you.
Do you have a credit card, Mr. Sandals?
Here's your key, sir.
If you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.
I'm sorry, sir.
Only VISA or MasterCard.
May I see your identification, please, sir?
Here you are.
Does that meet your expectations?
Yes, that sounds like what I want.
Would you like my American Express card?
Regrettably, Mr. Sandals, we accept only MasterCard or VISA.
Just dial 0 if you need anything.
My name is John Sandals, and I've got a reservation.
Thank you, sir. You'll be in room 507, nonsmoking, with a queen-size bed.
Do you approve, sir?
Yes, I do.
Do you accept American Express?
What time do you want the call?
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.
Good night, sir.
I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning.
Not at the moment, thank you.
Let me know if you do need anything.
Will there be anything else?
No, that gets it for now, thank you.
Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?
No sooner said than done.
Then again, I think 7:15 is too early.
Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.
Your wish is our command.
Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15.
