[theme song playing in Spanish] Okay, Carl, - your blood pressure looks good.
- [machine beeps] Now we're gonna do the thing where I ask you some basic health questions and you lie to me.
Okay? Alcoholic beverages per week? Two, maybe three.
Why you lying to me, Carl? Would you also like to lie to me about smoking? I stopped smoking.
Carl, the mouthwash works, but the shirt smells like Virginia Slims? They make my hands look bigger.
I'm not gonna write that down on the chart.
Dr.
Berkowitz will be here in a minute, okay? Hey, uh, what's that picture? Is that Halloween? Oh, no.
I think this was closer to Christmas.
But you're wearing army clothes.
Yes, I know.
The camouflage look was all the rage in Afghanistan.
You went to Afghanistan for Christmas.
I'ma give you a sec.
- Oh! - There you go! - Let me ask you - No, I never killed anyone.
Yes, it was hot over there.
You're welcome for my service.
Anything else? Well, I was just gonna ask you, is your husband also a badass soldier? Oh, yeah, he was.
- [gasps] Oh, my God, I'm sorry! - [laughs] Oh No, he he was a badass soldier, but now he does private security in Afghanistan.
But any anyways, we're separated.
So, you're single.
[chuckles] Yeah.
Actually, I was just about to go home and make dinner for my kids.
Single mom.
Well, this was fun.
Alex.
Alex, help.
Papito, let's go! You know I got a bum shoulder.
I need help over here.
Thank you.
Next time I'll Skype you.
We have a problem.
I know.
The hipsters have discovered Porto's.
Line around the block is like the freakin' Apple Store now.
Mom! And this one, I don't like her anymore.
I don't care if you like me.
Sounds like you're both on the same page.
Your daughter does not want to have a quinces.
What? Why? We already booked the room, and I found a great band! Okay, it's a deejay.
Okay, it's your brother with an iPod and a playlist, but it's a very good playlist.
I researched the history of quinceaÃ±eras and found out they're totally misogynistic.
She's been reading again.
Why do you let her read? I know, Mami.
I let her do math, too.
I'm a monster.
By the way, they made me captain of the debate team today at school, but all she wants to talk about is this.
She has to have a quinces.
How else will we know the day that our little girl becomes a woman? You missed it.
I was 12, I was in gym, and ironically, it happened in first period.
You are throwing away your Cuban heritage.
Yeah, the bad part.
I don't want to be paraded around in front of the men of the village like a piece of property to be traded for two cows and a goat.
Someone thinks they're worth a lot.
What century do you two think you're in? I mean, Elena, relax.
It's just a fun party.
You know, I'll have a little too much wine, embarrass you while I sob during my toast, uh, Abuelita will dance inappropriately with one of your guy friends You can count on it.
I'm not doing it.
You need to do something about this little sinvergÃ¼enza.
What does that even mean? It means that you do not know enough Spanish to know that I'm insulting you.
Oye [speaking Spanish] - Ha! - [speaking Spanish] - [laughs] - Abuelita [in English] I'll learn more Spanish when you learn English.
I know the English.
Besides, your abuelo, God rest his soul, did not marry me for my mind.
Who do you think you're insulting? Good one, Mom.
By the way, what are the last 16 digits of your credit card? Uh, what are you doing? Are you shopping? 'Cause who said you could shop? You said I could order sneakers for school.
[laughs] Five pairs? Monday through Friday.
Don't worry, I don't need weekend sneakers.
[chuckles] Oh, well I can't have my son walking around in Monday sneakers on a Saturday.
Somebody might call child services.
Mom, I'm serious.
I'm in middle school now.
How I look kinda matters.
Okay, so you can buy one pair for under $40.
Forty? That'll get you perfectly good sneakers to last the whole year.
The whole year? Okay, Mom, I know we're not rich, but are we poor? No, we're fine.
- That sounds like poor.
- We're not poor! I mean, look around! We have a TV, a refrigerator.
You have a laptop.
These are things that poor people have.
We have an air conditioner.
You never let us turn it on.
The point is you could, but don't.
Don't ever touch that thing.
All right, it's Friday night.
Family dinner time.
Come on, let's go! Elena, come set the table! Alex, help me make a salad.
This meat was heavily discounted, so I need to cook it before it turns.
You guys already ate, didn't you? She made ropa vieja.
I'm not made of stone.
Mami, I told you this morning that I was gonna cook tonight.
I thought it was a joke! And I thought it was hilarious.
Sorry, Mom.
Do you want us to sit and watch you eat? No.
[chuckles] We'll just start next Friday.
- Okay? - Okay.
- All right.
- Sounds good.
So, there is some ropa vieja in the mantequilla thing if you don't want to eat that sad meat.
I bought it, I'm eating it.
- Okay.
- [pipes groaning] Oh, yeah, that's not working.
Don't worry, I told Schneider.
Here's some hand sanitizer.
And here - I don't need lipstick.
- Yes, you do.
Okay.
You know how much I appreciate your help, but you have to let me establish my own traditions.
[bangs table] I agree.
So let's talk quinces.
Ay, Mami, ya! I don't wanna force her.
You know, this is all on me now.
I wanna handle it right.
You know a father would make sure that his little girl had a quinces.
You really wanna go there? 'Cause I'm holding a hammer.
I'm just saying, maybe when Victor comes back, you can work it out.
Remember when we all moved in together and you said, "If you ever want me to go away, just say, 'Go away.
'" Yeah.
Oh! [speaking Spanish] [banging] [banging stops] [coughs] [Lydia in English] You're welcome! [knocking on door] Schneider! Well, you grew out that mustache, huh? Yeah, I finally took the plunge and went full handlebar.
Feelin' really good about it.
I feel like it says, "I mean business.
" Yes, if your business is taming lions.
Oh, wait! I have one more.
You're 40 and you look stupid.
[sighs] I knew it! [groans] [laughs] What? Is That's fake? Yeah, I'm not gonna grow a real one until I know if people like it.
And I'll have you know, I was invited to several pride parades.
Please tell me you're here to fix my sink.
Yeah, fine! - Ooh, that's a cool hammer.
- Uh, careful.
That's very expensive Damascus steel.
Ah, so we've got two fancy tools up in here.
No, come on.
Come on! No.
You know you're the only non-Latino I trust to fix stuff.
Oh, is that racist? Oh, who cares, it's just us.
[chuckles] - [speaks Spanish] - [in English] Yeah, don't do that.
I regretted it as soon as I said it.
It's no problem.
I can get that done by tonight.
Maybe after dinner.
What's your mom cookin'? You've really been eating here a lot lately.
Yeah, I like it, too.
Can you believe it's only been 10 months since you moved in? I remember 'cause I got my five year sober chip and your mom baked me that cake.
Oh, I remember, yeah.
I'm sorry it was a rum cake.
I enjoyed watching you guys eat it.
Oh, by the way looks like you accidentally threw these out.
- I found 'em in the trash.
- Hmm.
Wonder how they got there.
Hey listen, you can tell me anything.
There's a landlord-tenant confidentiality clause in your lease.
No, there isn't.
Okay, there's not, but I really wanna know what's going on! Fine.
They're anti-depressants that Dr.
Berkowitz thought I might need, but he doesn't know what he's talking about, so Yeah, it sounds like he really cares about you.
What a dick! I don't need them, and I have to get them out of here because if my mom finds 'em, it'll be, [inhales deeply] [imitates Lydia] "Ay, Dios mÃ­o, she's a junkie like the Amy Winehouser.
" Yeah, so, I will, uh I'll just get that washer and we'll get that thing fixed right up.
Oh! Hello, Schneider.
Hola, seÃ±ora.
[laughs] Oh, you shave out your mustache.
- What, you liked it? - Oh, yes.
It made me laugh.
Elena! [speaks Spanish] - [in English] Come out here, honey.
- What's up, Abuelita? Okay, listen, uh [clears throat] I know you got issues with the quinces, but - All right - No, no, no.
No, no.
- [sighs] - But I am going to show you something that I think might change your mind.
This could be you.
Mommy, please, put those away.
I hate those pictures.
Burn it! Oh, hey! The quinceaÃ±era.
You're doing it! Elena, I knew you'd come around.
She didn't! She thinks she's being sold into slavery.
That's not really part of it, right? You know what? Let me talk to her.
[grunts] I've been doing some outreach down at the rec center, talking to at-risk youth.
No, I don't think you should do that.
Hey, girl.
How you livin'? Your abuela wants to throw you a sick kick-back on a Saturday night.
You know, keep it hundred.
You down? What's happening right now? Schneider, she's gonna do it.
I got this.
You know what, Captain Debater? Let's debate this.
But we're not doing a regular debate.
It's gotta be that thing I saw you do where we argue the opposite side to better understand each other.
You mean a Lincoln-Douglas debate? My specialty? I once successfully argued against gravity, so Ooh, I'ma take my earrings off 'cause it's about to go down! [grunting playfully] [Elena clears throat] The issue before us is quinces or no quinces.
Okay so I'm you.
[imitates Penelope] Mmm, listen kid! A quinces is just about the village celebrating that you're a woman, which I know you know 'cause you're the smartest one in the family! [laughs] Oh, I got better moves than that, right? [all] Eh But village isn't literal.
It just means your family and your friends.
So, what's so bad about this modern village coming together to celebrate you? - Oh, yeah! She's good.
- Oh.
Oh, my money's on her.
[chuckles] You guys wanna start takin' bets? Actually, scratch that.
I'm addicted to gambling.
Okay, now I'll be you.
[imitates Elena] Oh, my God! Do you even hear yourself? Seriously! Your argument is that my adulthood has to be approved by your friends? Pass! Well, I'm not gonna clap for that.
[in Spanish accent] So you want to crush my heart into pieces after I worked so hard to give you an opportunity in this land of the free and home of the brave? That's not me, that's her.
You make me sound like I have an accent.
[clears throat] Let's end this.
Elena, you wrecked your first communion because, as a vegetarian, you wouldn't eat the body of Christ.
You even refused to take any pictures with Santa because your abuelita wouldn't admit that Christmas is a pagan ritual.
Jesus and Santa were cousins.
Everybody knows this.
So, when it comes to your quinces I'm pleading with you.
Can't you do this one thing for your mother who loves you? Okay, Mom, I'll do it.
[all gasp] Wait, what? I'm saying, you win! You should have a quinces like you just proved.
[all laughing] Dang! Mami set you up! I didn't realize how right I was.
She said a bunch of stuff I didn't even think of! [laughs] Mami, [speaks Spanish].
Okay, this was stupid! I'm still not having a quinces.
Oh, God, just accept it.
You're Cuban, you're 15, you're gonna have a big party, with a poofy dress and a bad photo.
It's what we do.
[speaking Spanish] - [screams] - [door slams] [in English] She can speak Spanish.
Mrs.
Doyle is in exam room three and I swear to God, if that vieja calls me Maria one more time Mrs.
Doyle has Alzheimer's.
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
Hey, I'm messin' with ya.
She's just racist.
What's going on with you today? You're you're all on edge.
I had to put my foot down with Elena about her quinces, and I'm not sure if I did the right thing.
She wouldn't talk to me all weekend.
Oh, don't worry.
It gets better.
Eventually they leave.
[groans] It's just all on me now.
Oh, yeah, every move you make is fraught with peril.
Is this gonna be the one that scars them for life? And in my case, the answer was always yes.
Well, it's just a lot of pressure and sometimes I don't know.
Did you ever take those No, no.
I threw them right in the trash.
It's fine! There's just a lot going on right now.
But it's more than that, right? You were talking to me about nightmares I know what I said.
Look, if if you had something wrong with your heart, and I gave you some medicine, you would take it.
So why wouldn't you do the same with this? Yeah.
But to be fair, I probably wouldn't take that heart crap either.
[chuckles] I mean, as a nurse, I would totally recommend it, but as a Cuban, I suffer in silence.
A silent Cuban? Hey, I'd like to meet one of those.
[laughing] - And she's a teenager, right? - Right.
At least I'm safe for another year with the little one.
[cell phone chimes] - Oh! Your phone telling you things.
- Oh, yeah.
Alex ordered some sneakers for school.
I get an alert every time a package is delivered.
[cell phone chimes repeatedly] How many feet does that kid have? Hey, so, for the quinces, is there any way I can get a plus three? Currently in a bit of a lady-juggling situation.
No, I promised you to Consuelo.
[laughs] Now, she has a good mustache.
Just kidding.
[laughs] It's not that good.
Alex.
Alex! He can't hear you! - [door closes] - He is possessed by the YouTube.
- I can explain.
- [Penelope] Really? You can explain how one pair of sneakers magically became five? Because that is some Jesus crap right there.
Sorry I said Jesus so close to the word crap.
Mom, this family's been through a lot, and I felt like I needed to provide because I'm the man of the house now.
Oh, that's why you bought five pairs of sneakers? That's why I bought no pairs of sneakers.
Oh, he's into magic now? [laughs] Can I be your assistant? [laughs] No, I will become the focus.
Free returns, Mom.
I can order any pair I want, wear them a couple of times.
As long as I keep them clean, I can send them right back.
I know you wanna be mad, but that's genius.
No, it's not.
Alex, there's no way you can keep all these sneakers - clean enough to send back.
- Oh, no? Oh, so, it's six pairs of shoes? Okay, what about the bottoms? You've been walking around all day.
Oh, you're right, Mom.
I mean, you gotta get him on Shark Tank or something.
No.
No, this ends now.
It's like you're stealing.
Exactly! It's like I'm stealing.
No, you're not charming your way out of this.
I said one new pair.
You disobeyed me.
Now, you get no new pairs.
No, you know what? Now, you get Elena's old sparkly ones.
With the multicultural princesses? No! Lucky for you, she never wore them 'cause they were too gender-specific.
She did like that they were diverse.
I'm not wearing those.
I still don't understand why I can't buy these.
Don't you have more money now that Papi's gone? [scoffs] What? Well, you have a job, plus Papi gives you money, right? So that's, like, double money.
Sit down.
- [sighs] - Let me talk to him.
- Hey, little man Okay.
- Out! Yes, your papi gives me money, but it's for the basics, and it's not a lot.
But he's absolutely doing his best, and he will always be your papi.
But make no mistake, when it comes to money, I'm your daddy.
Tomorrow, these all go back.
- Everything okay? - [sighs] I need you to sign my test.
Yes, everything is fine.
At least you're talking to me now.
It says you got a D.
I know.
This is social studies.
You love this! Yeah.
I guess I didn't try because I don't need an education now that I'm gonna be chattel.
And without schoolwork, I have more time to plan my magical quinces.
So [sighs] Ay.
Okay.
Enough.
Yes, you keep that up, and you will not have a quinces.
Wait I can't believe you.
You know how hard I bust my ass, by myself, to send you to that school so that you can have more opportunities than I did.
Then you you pull this crap? I can't even look at you right now.
Just go to your room.
You keep saying that you want me to be this strong, independent woman like you.
And then, when I tell you that I don't want to be a part of something that I think is a misogynist cultural ritual, you tell me to shut up, do it anyway.
[scoffs] So which is it, Mom? Lupita, are you okay? Ah, you're like me.
You get upset and you clean.
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait, what what is that? It's an anti-depressant that I'm gonna be taking.
- [gasps] - So just deal with it.
That is your answer? Drugs? Okay, open your mouth and spit it in my hand.
I haven't even taken it yet! And it's okay, Mom.
It's something that helps.
But do you even see everything that's happening now? You don't need drugs.
You need your husband.
Oh, God, stop it! Stop.
Victor is not the answer.
I know you didn't want him to go back to Afghanistan, but he's making money.
He's being a good provider.
There are jobs here where they don't shoot at you.
We live in America, name one! It's not just the job, and you know that! - It's not like he cheated on you.
- It's not the only thing that matters.
We are Cuban.
We don't get divorced, we die.
Don't you think I miss him? You think I like being alone? I wanted to do this with somebody.
That was the plan.
Family dinners, and inside jokes, and one of the kids says something cute, and you share a look.
And even right now to be able to say, "Okay, they're insane, we're not.
" A partner.
[voice breaking] Someone to love.
Someone someone in your bed.
You know, since Victor's gone, I don't sleep.
Because he used to spoon me to sleep.
So, yeah, Mom I miss the good stuff.
Sometimes you just need somebody to give you a hug and say, "I got you.
" I meant a man.
I am very strong.
I've been doing my yoga.
I got you.
[sighs] [Penelope] Hey.
The ladies be looking at your feet.
Something's wrong.
Am I right? I'm sorry.
Nah, I think I can make these work.
Or, I noticed you bought a pair for under 40 bucks, which means you did the right thing before you did the many, many wrong things.
Really? Oh, thank you! I was trying to be brave, but even the nuns would've made fun of me.
Listen, you don't have to worry about being the man of the house.
First of all, we don't have a house, so there's that.
You just be a twelve-year-old boy, okay? Okay.
And you're right, I shouldn't worry too much about what's going on down here, when I got so much going on up here.
Ah! [laughs] Puberty's gonna hit you like a train.
Hey.
Hello.
So there's been a lot of yelling.
Okay, it was mostly me.
But I hear you and you don't have to have a quinces.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yeah, and this is not because of that crap you pulled with the test.
You do that again and I'll put my quinces tiara on you while you sleep, and post it to your Instagram.
Don't test me.
Okay.
Look, I get the whole misogynist thing.
I do.
But I hate to tell you lots of good stuff has started for dumb man reasons.
Yeah, like, marriage used to be a way to pay off debts.
Plus, women were being raped everywhere, so you'd marry your daughter off to some guy and say, "Okay, he owns her now.
No raping this one.
" My point is we've made progress.
I didn't know you were such a feminist, Mom.
I can assemble a rifle in 13 seconds.
I'm a total badass.
How are you missing this? [chuckles] I'm sorry, it's just a lot of times you sound like a mom.
Yeah, well, I am one.
And there is a part of me that buys into that cheesy "my little girl is becoming a woman" thing, because you're not a little girl anymore.
That is super weird.
[sighs] If I'm being honest with myself, I was making your quinces about me.
I guess I wanted people to show up and say, "Look at the amazing single mom pulling it all together by herself.
" I know.
It was dumb.
It's not dumb.
They're dumb.
- Who? - The people.
No, there's no people, that's just a thing that I said.
No, I'll do it.
All I wanted was a good reason why, and you just gave me one.
Oh, my God, really? [laughing] That is so great! We'll we'll do the whole thing.
The ceremony, the stupid waltz.
We're gonna show them what single mothers can pull off.
I will dress like a child bride for you, Mom.
Okay, now I feel like I should talk you out of it.
[chuckles] Yeah, but I won't.
I won't.
Your abuelita, she can be a broken record, but she taught me life can be tough.
So when you get something to celebrate, you take it.
Then take photos.
Photos I'll use to scare your children.
Oh, I'm not having children.
Not today.
[exhales heavily] Move over.
What? What are you doing here? - I'm going to spoon you.
- No.
- Yes, move over.
- Mami, no! - Okay, shh! - No! - You're gonna like this.
It's very nice.
- No, don't do it.
- Oh, yes, see? See? - [sighs] [both] Mmm.
Ay! Oh! Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You were just having a nightmare.
You are not at war.
You are home.
You are safe.
Everything is okay.
- Okay? - Okay.
Except, I'm 38 years old sleeping with my mom.
And what is wrong with that? Are you wearing makeup? Of course! What if I got up in the middle of the night and I ran into someone? Like you might barge in on Julio Iglesias in the bathroom? You don't know where Julio spends his time.
And I need to look nice in case I die in my sleep.
Ay, Mami, don't say that.
No, mija, if I do die, and I'm not saying I will make sure that they do a good job on my face for the funeral and bring a little red lipstick along.
I know.
You've been telling me since I was five.
- Don't let them make me up like a puta! - them make me up like a puta! And my shade is Scarlet Sunrise.
Okay, I'm gonna go make breakfast.
This is a good thing.
Don't give me that look, bitch.
That's two.
That's three! Oh, my God, five? What's going on in there? The first one was for pee.
And the last four were to piss you off.
So you're basically murdering the planet just to spite me.
Yeah, and it worked.
Ay, it's impossible to be Zen in this house.
You know, it's bad enough that you take 40-minute showers.
I have to use water to get ready.
Every time I show up at school, there are all these eyes expecting perfection.
And you give it to them, papito.
Easy.
It's setting.
Mija, why are you in your uniform before you shower and get ready? I am ready, Abuelita.
That's what I was afraid of.
Okay, everybody.
Let's go.
I can't be late.
We're having one of our staff meetings at work.
Aren't there only four of you? And yet, we take attendance.
But I've actually got some good stuff to talk about today, so hopefully I can get through it without being interrupted by Scott, the freakin' bobo.
You know, I know bobo is an insult, but it sounds adorable.
- Like he's a little clown.
- Oh, yes, he is a clown.
And like every other clown, I want to punch him in the face.
But I'm a professional.
So when he starts pulling his crap, I am gonna smile, I'm gonna nod but inside, I'm gonna be like Don't worry, I got this.
I spent all week preparing this badass spreadsheet and I'm gonna make it rain informative data.
Ooh, I have a lot going on today, too.
They're implementing my composting initiative in the cafeteria.
I wish I could make you this excited about a comb.
Our school's waste stream will really shrink if we let the food decompose naturally.
And once I'm able to introduce worms triple the excretions.
You have weird goals.
Hey! No, she doesn't.
Yes, she does, right? Okay! Staff meeting, everybody.
Staff meeting.
First things first.
- Lori.
- Here.
Okay.
Penelope.
Here.
We're all here.
There's four of us.
Halfway there.
Scott.
Dr.
Berkowitz.
- Okay, any new business? - Yes! Turns out, I've been wearing the wrong bra size.
My whole life! Great.
That's that's that's great.
Anything about the office? Yes, yes.
Here's some information I think you'll all find interesting, dare I say, badass.
Lately, we've been getting some complaints from patients about wait times.
Oh, that's not good.
Well, if we stagger our appointments by just five minutes, we could decrease wait time, while still maintaining an excellent level of patient-doctor Actually, it sounds like the patients won't get the same amount of time with Dr.
B that they've come to expect.
Well, they'd have more time with him, if, if Actually, in today's medical industry, it's important we don't sacrifice human interaction just for the sake of expediency.
Actually Scott, I've been involved in today's medical industry even longer than you And it's easy to get burned out? I get it.
Boy, such great contributions today.
Aw, thank you.
All I'm saying is, there's a reason this guy's been running the office this way for so long.
Right, Berkules? I like that, yeah.
And I must say, I'm very attracted to the concept of nothing changing.
- Okay, but there is a - Great! Status quo it is.
All right, meeting adjourned.
Thank you, everybody.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right, Doc? Oh.
- Oh, my God, is that how Cubans clap? - You don't wanna find out.
I have a salsa emergency.
The condiment or the dance? I am equipped for both.
There's this girl Lola.
Ooh, is she cubana? Close, she's from Sacramento.
We're going out dancing tonight, and I may have led her to believe that I know how to salsa dance.
- Uh-huh.
- Do you think you could show me a couple moves you Wow, you're amazing! I know.
Now, salsa is just, "You want me.
You can't have me.
You want me! No, you can't have me!" Now take me in your arms like a man.
Huh.
See, I consider myself a feminist, so I don't know Oh, that kinda man.
Got it.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Move those hips.
Feel the music! Show me something.
So you are in love with this girl? Ho, ho, yikes! Slow down.
I'm not in love with her.
Love isn't even real.
It's just something your nanny says sometimes to your dad.
The first moment I saw my Berto, a lightning bolt went through me and I saw my future.
The next 40 years went by as quickly as that first night.
- Wow, that is so inspiring.
- Mmm.
We hooked up at a barbecue.
Okay! It's time to dance.
Churning the bottle, churning the bottle.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Â¡SÃ­! Take my leg, bruto.
Ugh, I get it, we're Cuban! AzÃºcar! Can you believe this living stereotype? I know.
It's Uh-oh.
Oh, my God, what's happening? Oh, it's happening.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I think it's my hot Cuban blood! Oh, I must dance! Whoo! - Come on! - Hey! - Come on, now! Whoo! - What? Okay, I'm dizzy.
Okay, there goes my shoulder.
Whatever, I needed that.
I had a crazy annoying day.
It couldn't have been as bad as mine.
At lunch, no one scraped their food into the new composting bins.
Even when I stood in front of the trash cans.
Zach Miller hit her with a hamburger.
What? No! He threw it in the wrong bin and I deflected it with my face.
No one was listening to me! So she started screaming and calling everyone, "Earth murderers.
" Look, Elena, I get it, 'cause it's in me, too.
In five seconds, I go from nodding thoughtfully to lighting a car on fire.
You lit a car on fire? That happened only once, okay? And it was kind of an accident.
But that's why you and me, we gotta watch it.
You know, like today, I barely got a word in before el bobo started interrupting me, talking over me.
I couldn't even get my point across.
Well, that's just sexist.
No.
He's not smacking me on the ass and going, "Oye, mamita!" Oh, that makes me miss your abuelo.
You wanna see real sexism? Be a woman in the Army, okay? You got a 22-year-old white boy from South Carolina marching behind you going, "Is it hot out here or is it you?" Of course, it was hot out there.
It was a freaking desert.
But you wanna know how I dealt with that bobo? By being a better soldier than him.
And eventually, that's how they saw me, not as a woman at all.
I would prefer to die.
Yo no entiendo cÃ³mo these men and women all want to be the same.
We should celebrate our differences.
I would never trade these for that.
Mami.
No, no, I agree with her.
Everybody wants to see those.
Nobody wants to see this.
Okay, everybody stop gesturing.
Mom, I'm not talking about old people sexism.
- Okay.
- It's much more subtle now.
Men assert their power through microaggressions and mansplaining.
Oh, mansplaining.
Is that like manscaping? I just learned that and I love it.
No, mansplaining is when a It's when a man explains something to a woman that she already knows, but he acts like he's teaching her.
Does that make sense? What? I was just explaining what mansplaining Oh, wow! Elena, microaggressions and all this little crap If I got bent out of shape every time a man said something stupid, you wouldn't be here.
Mom! This is a real problem.
The sexism I'm talking about is all the little disrespectful things that men do that That they don't even realize.
Sorry, I cut you off.
Talk as long as you want.
Not that you need my permission.
I'm just You know what? I'd like to hear from the ladies.
Women.
Females.
You guys Not guys, humans.
Wow, you broke Schneider.
Mom this stuff might not seem like a big deal, but it chips away at you.
You gotta call Scott out.
Why would I waste my time? That is right.
You will never win men over by confronting them.
You flirt with them.
You hypnotize them.
And then you do whatever the hell you want.
And then they will think they are the boss, but really, you are the boss.
Why can't they just know you're the boss? Oh, no, they would be so upset.
That is horrifying.
Oh, sÃ­? Well, nobody ever threw a hamburger in my face.
Man, I'm glad I'm a guy, so I don't have to think about sexism.
Mi amor, wake up.
Oh! What are you doing? I was thinking that if you would wear a little makeup, you would look presentable and maybe the people in school would listen to your garbage ideas.
How would that help? Lawyers would love to wear sweatpants, but they wear suits so the judge will take them seriously.
- Go on.
- Really? So makeup makes you beautiful.
Beauty gives you power, and that is why I never let anyone see me without it.
I just realized, my whole life I've never seen you without makeup.
Yes, you have.
My baby pictures.
Even in those you had your ears pierced.
Oh, without earrings I look ridiculous.
But mija, por favor won't you just try it my way, huh? I like what you said about power, so, all right, I'll give it a try.
Ah! Gracias! Wonderful news.
Elena can be in the Christmas card this year.
Oh, you look very nice.
Thank you.
- I meant her.
- What? She didn't do anything.
What? Nothing.
Just, if you get hit with a hamburger today, it's gonna stick.
Oh, come on, Elena, it looks nice.
You just look different.
What is this? Wear-your-grandma-to-work day? I'm kidding! You look great.
And whatever this is, good luck with it.
Well, what are you gonna do about Scott, the bobo? Nothing, because he doesn't matter.
I'm going straight to Dr.
Berkowitz.
Then I'll accomplish my goal, and Scott's burgundy-red Buick Regal, license plate 374 PCE will remain unharmed.
- Just a little more rouge.
- Ay, Mami, no.
Damn it, you're right.
Oh, gracias.
Yeah, thank you so much.
Have a nice day.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you about my waiting room ideas - from the meeting yesterday.
- Hey, we have a waiting room full of patients out there who are very unhappy.
Sounds like there's a problem that a badass spreadsheet could've fixed.
When my dogs are upset, I rub their bellies.
Should I There's gotta be something we could do.
Blue Sky, what if we stagger the appointments by just five minutes? People would wait less, and be so much happier when they see your handsome mug.
Smart way to go! - Boom.
- Boom! Okay.
I am not trying to turn this into an argument, but I said the same thing yesterday and nobody listened.
I don't think that's exactly what you said.
No, that's exactly what I said, Scott.
But maybe you didn't hear, because you were on your phone like now.
Uh, what? Yo voy a matar este hombre.
Huh? What does that mean? I'm just thinking about lunch.
I'm hungry.
Oh.
When it comes to ideas, no one's keeping score, but today, Scott wins! Oh, all right, I need to say something.
I do.
Okay, uh, Scott Sometimes I've noticed, when I'm talking, you don't listen.
I've let it go, but now I'm saying something professional in a professional manner professionally.
I think what Penelope's trying to say Oh, my God! Stop saying what I am trying to say, you mansplaining, microaggressive, bobo cabrÃ³n! You're sexist, and I'm tired of letting it go! Does that make sense? Okay, lot of big feelings and a fertile area for what is now our biannual staff meeting.
Hold up, Doc.
You think I'm sexist? That's crazy.
I love women.
It's got nothing to do with love.
It's the way you act.
You dismiss everything I say! Oh.
Yeah, you better be waving at someone you know.
Guys, guys! Let's keep our anger where it belongs, with the patients! I don't know what you're complaining about.
If anything, I'm the victim of reverse sexism.
What? I'm in a traditionally female-dominated profession, and if I had to diagnose what's happening, you're jealous because I'm killing it.
Oh, my God! That's insane! Okay, don't get hysterical.
Okay, you see that! That right there, that is sexist! You would never say that to Dr.
Berkowitz.
That's 'cause Dr.
B's cool as a cuke.
I'm about to cry.
I do everything around here, okay? I order office supplies, I call insurance companies, I even make the stupid coffee because yours sucks and Lori always burns herself.
It never looks hot.
How about all the times you take off early for your kids' appointments and I'm left to pick up the slack, because moms are special? What did you say? Uh-oh! I dropped my pen.
Scott, could you go get that for me? Moms are special! Because we have to work twice as hard.
We really do! Dogs are not children, Lori! Look, sometimes I do have to take time off because braces need tightening or because my kid's head is a, quote, "lice carnival.
" But I always make it up, and it is just as valid as you leaving early for Shark Week.
All I'm saying is we're equal.
We all work hard.
We all make the same $30 an hour.
Thirty dollars an hour? He makes more than me? You know what? I think I'll get my pen.
No, I'll get it on my way out, 'cause I am leaving.
Penelope No.
Since I'm obviously not appreciated around here, I am going to cut my salary by 100%.
I think she's trying to say she's quitting.
Shut up, Scott! But, yes, I quit.
I'm sorry, Lori.
Your dogs are lovely.
Thanks for the azÃºcar.
Your accent is still no good.
But my salsa moves are, thanks to you.
My date's such a huge success, it's still happening.
Oh, I can't wait to meet her.
Eh, you probably won't.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh what happened to your face? Um, I took the makeup off after first period, because people were staring at me and all these boys were talking to me, which is the last thing I want.
I don't understand any words you are saying to me.
It was terrible.
My friends were calling her names like cute and pretty.
I'm the pretty one in this family.
Yes, you are, papito.
Elena, I thought you were finally listening to me.
I did listen to you, Abuelita.
And I listened to Mom, too.
I was very professional.
I smiled and nodded and was nice to everyone.
It looked really unnatural.
I mean, some people still called me Garbage Girl, but I just went When inside, I was thinking - So, thank you.
- Oh! You're welcome, mija.
So, tomorrow, we try the makeup again? No, Abuelita, I tried it and I didn't like it.
Oh, honey.
This morning I saw what you could be.
The granddaughter I have always wanted.
I wish you would've said that in Spanish, so I didn't understand it.
Oh, niÃ±a, no! No, I didn't mean it like that.
No, no.
You know, you use makeup like armor because it makes you comfortable.
Well, this is how I feel comfortable.
I like the way I am, even if you don't.
Elena Mami, I did something terrible.
It's okay, I have a shovel.
Wait, what? Wait, what do you think I did? It doesn't matter, amor.
No one will ever know.
Mami I quit my job.
I don't understand.
The job ended? No, it didn't end.
- Did your boss die? - No.
Was there a fire? Scandal? Was he a sex offender and they closed down the business because of the shame? No! I have just said all the reasons! I quit my job because I found out that comemierda Scott makes more than I do, and he's only been there one month.
Oh, so you quit because of principles.
Are you crazy? I know, I know.
I did exactly what I told Elena not to do.
I yelled, I screamed, and it felt great.
But, now, we're all gonna have to live in the car.
It's open! Penelope? Oh, hello, Lydia.
You look lovely, as always.
I know.
I will let you two talk.
What's up? Penelope, please, come back to work.
I'm beggin' you.
I can't run the office without you.
You're just saying that to be nice.
No, I'm not! I need you.
Five bucks more an hour.
That guy.
Well, he's a good nurse but it wasn't right.
Wasn't right.
But in my defense he did ask for more than you did, and I have a lot of trouble saying no.
That's why Lori works with us.
That mystery's solved.
To be honest, I don't know if it's a woman thing or what.
I didn't even think about negotiating.
I was newly separated.
I really needed a job.
You said, "Do you want one?" I said, "Yes.
" And you see, he made me feel that somehow I was lucky to have him.
I even gave him my parking spot.
Oh, so the red Buick is yours? Good to know.
But I'm sorry, and it was nothing personal.
And you deserve more.
How about this? How about this? What if I give you a raise, and you make the same amount as Scott? - Plus a dollar more an hour.
- Done.
Two dollars more an hour and Scott starts pulling his weight? - Done.
- Which he's never gonna do, so let's make it three dollars an hour.
- Done! Please? - Okay.
Okay.
That was fun.
And I have to admit, Scott is not a terrible nurse.
He's good with the patients, you know? He's got a charm that I do not understand.
Well, he's got that jock thing going on.
I think that's what seduced me.
You know, all the nicknames and the fist bumps I guess I got caught up in the bromance.
I get it.
No, I don't get it at all.
But I get it.
So, are we good? Yes.
- Boom? - Yeah, I don't do that.
I do this.
Are you asleep, mi amor? Abuelita, no.
We're not doing this again.
No, no.
I'm not here to make you up.
I'm here to do this.
This is me.
No armor.
I think you look beautiful.
Aw.
I hate it.
This is how you feel when you're wearing makeup? Yeah, it is.
Then I understand, and I will never bother you about that again.
Except for your quinces.
And I'm okay with that.
You know, this is the only time anyone has ever seen me without makeup.
I'm honored.
Well, one time your abuelo came home early and saw me, but as soon as I realized, I went out the window.
I assume he thought I was an intruder.
We never spoke of it.
- Are you wearing a little mascara? - No!
 [alarm beeps] [Latin music playing over stereo] [music continues playing] - Good morning.
- [both] Morning.
Ah.
You're amazing.
I know.
Mami, we already have crosses everywhere.
Do we really need a pope on the fridge? Oh, yes, because he is so inspiring.
You walk in to get a yogurt, you see him Hola, Papa.
Puts a smile on your face.
Well, why don't you put the pope in your room and go smile in there? [laughs] I already have two popes in my room.
Gracias very much.
Oh.
Oh, what's that, Papa? Are you lonely? You wanna be with your friends? Well [speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] [in English] He looks happy there.
[theme song playing in Spanish] You can probably dump that whole thing on there.
[laughs] Next time.
- [chuckles] - [door slams] [all] Hi! Welcome home, Lupita.
We are almost done, but there is plenty left.
Aw.
Dinner with my entire family And Schneider.
Yes, I invited him again.
He's an orphan.
Do orphans always have rich dads who buy them buildings? Hey, I may have money in the bank and two living parents, and four living stepmothers but there is a hole in here.
We never had family meals.
I ate alone in front of the TV.
Ay, pobrecito Schneider.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
It was a massive TV.
Sometimes my nanny would join me, but only if I agreed to watch telenovelas.
Ooh, those are so over the top.
Right? This one time, Rosa got jealous of the housekeeper 'cause she was makin' a move on her man, so she threatened to throw live scorpions on her while she slept.
Sounds good.
Which one was that? Oh, no.
Rosa was my nanny.
Ex-nanny.
Now, stepmother.
[sighs] I am so glad to be here.
I'm just glad to be home with everybody.
Who the hell are you? [scoffs] This is Carmen, my best friend.
I'm doing my history project with her.
These all sound like things I should know.
Hi, Carmen.
Hi.
[sighs] Ah.
[grunts] I'm Penelope.
Kind of a big deal around here.
So, uh, what's this history project you're working on? And then maybe later you can show me how to turn into a bat.
Well, we just got done explaining the whole thing.
Oh, come on, mija, I missed it.
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
Alex, tell your mother that funny story that happened in chemistry class.
- Again? - I know, okay, I'll tell it.
[chuckles] So, there is the floor and slip.
[laughing] [Schneider laughs] Oh, that Dylan.
Oh, that story never gets old.
- [laughs] - [Penelope] Oh, man.
I've been workin' so much, I'm missing all the scoops plus Latina Twilight over here.
Careful.
There's a lot of garlic in that chicken.
Your mom's kind of mean.
I'm obsessed with her.
Who would like a pastelito? Mmm! You know what? How about we go on a family hike this Saturday like we used to? Mom, uh, Carmen and I need all Saturday for our history thing.
Yeah, and Abuelita and I have tickets to wrestling.
I don't understand why you waste good money on that.
It's educational.
Eh, I don't know.
Okay, Saturday's out.
How about we go on a hike Sunday morning before it gets hot? You seem to have forgot.
Sunday morning is for church.
So, we skip church.
You seem to have forgot.
We don't skip church.
Mami, it's okay if we miss it one time.
It's not gonna kill us.
Oh, really? My great uncle Luisito skipped church, and on the same day, he was crushed by a runaway tractor.
Why don't you just go to church and then go hikin' after? We're Latinos, church takes all day.
By the time you're done with mass and you've said hello to fulano y fulana, - it's five o'clock! - Oh, you exaggerate.
4:30.
[Penelope clicks tongue] I wanna see these guys this weekend.
Come on.
'Cause I like them.
[chuckles] - [Alex and Elena chuckle] - Oh, no, I have to put my foot down.
Sundays we go to church And then, sometimes we go to Applebee's.
Well, I have a foot, too, and I'm gonna put my foot down and say this Sunday we're not going to church.
Well, I am putting both of my feet down.
We are going and that is the end of it.
Ya! That's not your decision to make.
It's startin' to feel kinda like home in here.
I'm with Mom.
We don't need to go to church.
After all, Abuelita, you don't even believe half that stuff.
- I believe everything.
- [Elena] Really? When you take the communion you believe you're eating the actual flesh and blood of Jesus? Ay, no, it's a symbol.
Don't be gross.
Okay, so, if you believe that, then you're Protestant.
There is no need for name-calling.
All I know is that a good Catholic does not skip church.
Right, papito? I like church.
I see my friends.
I eat some donuts.
Now, this one gets it.
We're going.
No, we are not! I work hard all week.
When I get home, there's barely enough time to have a meal with the kids.
Weekends are my only chance.
So, this Sunday, no church.
End of discussion.
[speaking Spanish] - Ooh.
- [Carmen] Ooh.
[in English] What? What'd she say? I am raising my voice, because I cannot believe we're having this discussion! I'm their mother! I don't need to ask permission! I decide.
And I am your mother, and I decide what you decide.
We are a family, damn it! Don't make me choose between you.
Okay, I'd choose Lydia because of her warm food and even warmer hugs.
But I'd feel really bad about it.
All right, everybody, go do your homework.
Schneider, go call one of your moms.
Fine.
Guess I'll just go eat this all alone in front of my massive TV.
- Thought that was at your dad's house - I have one, too! - Ay.
- [door closes] Okay, Mami I love you, but I'm their mother and you're making decisions that I should be making.
- Â¿Ah, sÃ­? - Yeah.
Like, I don't like the kids having dessert every night.
Oh, come on.
Es una cosita.
But we have to watch our sugar.
Dad had diabetes.
So, I killed your father? What? No! Mami, look around.
I told you, I don't want crosses and pope stuff everywhere.
My apartment looks like Jesus' Pinterest page.
This is my house, and I decide if I want obese kids or the pope staring at me while I pee.
Ah yo entiendo.
I cook, I clean, I teach the children manners But if I should have an opinion, you want me to keep my mouth shut.
Ay, exactly.
- Thank you for understanding - No! So I am a servant? Like Cinderella? No, Cinderbuela.
No more! You don't like what I am doing, I won't do it.
- Mami, please.
- I'll be in my servant's quarters.
Slam! I have to say "slam" because you would not give me a door! [alarm beeps] [Latin music playing over stereo] What? Eso Yeah! Oh.
Where's Abuelita? - Pouting.
- Where's breakfast? Working on it.
Where's breakfast? I'm I'm working on it.
Where are my pants? You're kidding, right? How can you not know where your pants are at? Abuelita washed them.
She said my cuffs looked shabby.
Who am I to disagree? All right, Mami, you win! Where are Alex's pants? [Latin music continues playing] Where's Abuelita? She's small.
She's probably under something.
[music stops playing] Kids I think your abuelita has run away from home.
[knocking on door] [clears throat] - Hello, Schneider.
Listen, have you - Wow! I always forget how huge your apartment is.
Nah, come on, it's not that big.
But let's talk in the parlor.
Schneider, have you seen my mom? Gosh, no.
[sniffs] Then why do I smell fried plantains and Cuban coffee? Fine! She spent the night.
But I want you to know, nothing happened.
What were you thinking, chasin' that woman away? She's funny, she's charming, and when she gets angry, she cleans.
- Where is she? - [Schneider] I don't know.
After last night's ugliness, she spent the night and left without saying goodbye, so she already knows the drill.
Unlike some people.
What was that? And why was she drinking my coffee? Well, when my family oasis blew up last night, I had to seek solace in the arms of I don't know her name.
Your mom called her the "Stick Girl" and made her eat plato de huevos.
Did Abuelita forget to give her her pants, too? Well, there's no reason to get lawyers involved.
My daughter.
Katie, if I raised my voice the other night, I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry for that, too.
And that.
No, no, wait, wait, no.
Now I am not going to apologize for saying "unemployed," because that's what you are.
[laughs] You're so sensitive.
[imitates gunshot] And, sweetheart, I just want you to be honest with yourself and ask what happens if your self-published vampire erotica doesn't take off.
No, no, of course, I believe in you.
[stutters] It's And she's gone.
[sighs] Well, you know how kids are.
Thirty-seven is a rough age.
Any word from your mom? No, but I'm sure she's home talking crap about me with Juan Pablo and Benedicto.
Has she ever disappeared like this before? No, usually when we fight, she does the opposite of go away.
She just sighs really loudly.
[imitates Lydia] "Ay!" [normal] Anything to draw attention to the fact that she's wounded and nearby.
[stutters] My ex used to have a sigh, too.
It went like this [inhales deeply] "I hate you!" I still miss her.
I just I don't I don't have time for this drama, you know? I got work, I got bills, I got kids.
Well, doesn't she help out? Yeah, she gets the groceries, cooks, cleans, spends time with the kids, does the laundry Sounds like she does everything.
Well, it does when I say it out loud.
She's also turning my apartment into the Sistine Chapel.
That must look amazing.
- Okay, I'm not explaining this right.
- [cell phone rings] Wait, hold on.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Schneider, I am just about to leave.
What's up? I just came down to get my afternoon cafÃ© con leche and kiss on the cheek from your mom, - but she's still not here.
- What? But don't worry, though.
I got this.
All three kids are fine.
- Three? - Yeah.
Carmen, Elena's best friend? We have got to catch you up.
I know who Carmen is.
She's the ghost who ate all my chicken.
Hi, Ms.
Alvarez.
[Schneider] Takin' you off speaker.
Great.
Now she's gonna send her flying monkeys after me.
- And now you're off speaker.
- Schneider! Oh, my God.
Anyway [sighs] I appreciate you helping me out.
Ah, it's cool.
I had to get out of my apartment.
Stick Girl is still up there.
I called her an Uber this morning.
The guy never showed.
Maybe it's a sign.
Should I marry her? Schneider, I gotta go.
Okay, now I'm worried.
She's never not been home when the kids get there.
And plus, she's 70.
One wrong move and she's down.
You know, the entire world is one giant, wet bathroom floor.
- [stutters] Any idea where she could be? - No, none.
Huh Where would a devout Catholic woman go after an argument with her daughter about religion? [scoffs] Thank you, Dr.
Berkowitz.
Thank you.
But we need to answer the question.
[sighs] Hi, Mami.
So, you just assumed I was here? Because I'm an ignorant, old woman married to prayer? But you are here.
Still you shouldn't stereotype.
- Hi, Birdie.
- [chuckles] She is such a suck-up.
She thinks she's tan fancy because her four grandsons are altar boys.
Guataca.
[scoffs] Move over.
- Ah-ah! - Oh! [sighs] So have you been here all day? Getting decorating ideas? No I have been riding around this morning in something called el Uber.
Oh, wow.
That must've been expensive.
Schneider set it up.
I think it's free.
[laughing] Oh, I think that car was for Stick Girl.
Oh, her.
Mami I feel terrible about our argument, but we gotta talk about some things.
Okay.
But you must keep your voice down, because you-know-who just put in new batteries.
So I may have overreacted last night, but you have to understand, I'm not gonna be a mom for much longer.
Elena is having her quinces.
Alex is already using hair gel.
And, you know, soon they're gonna be out of the house.
I just I need you to give me more space to parent.
I understand what you are saying.
- [crying] Don't put me in a home.
- What? What, Mami? No, no.
I wouldn't I'm not gonna do I would never do that.
I would never do that! - Ever.
- [mumbles] - Oh, no? - No! I would never put you in a home.
- Mami, where is this coming from? - [sighs] Your abuela [sniffles] Berto's mama, used to live with us And all day long, she would slice onions the most beautiful paper-thin onions.
I remember.
Nobody could slice an onion like Abuela.
Well, it's not that hard.
You need a sharp knife, that's all.
But it made her feel useful.
Problem was, we hated onions.
So, one day we told her.
The next week, dead.
Oh that's terrible.
I know.
I still get teary when I [stutters] slice an onion.
[sobbing] Mami, you are the glue that holds our home together.
Without you, we'd be on the street living in a cardboard box.
[sighs] You're just saying that to cheer me up.
- No.
- [sniffles] I'm really not.
We need you.
So, Mami could you make me un cafecito in the morning for the rest of my life? [sighs] [sniffles] Claro.
[Birdie] Aw She is like a bat! Shall we? Yes.
And we'll be back Sunday, anyways.
Yeah, you know, we'll talk about that later.
We'll talk What's to talk about? Well [stutters and chuckles] I'm just not sure I wanna go to church [softly] Maybe ever again.
What? She said she didn't want to go to church.
- [dinging] - Mami! Don't do that! Mami, por favor, vÃ¡monos ya, - please! - You go on.
I will pray for your eternal soul And then call el Uber.
[all] Hi! Welcome home, Lupita! We already started, but I insisted nobody say anything interesting till you got here.
Aw, that's so sweet.
It's been weird.
Did you find Abuelita? Yeah, she's with Jesus now.
- [Elena and Alex] What? - [Penelope] No, no! Sorry.
She's at church.
Uh, poor choice of words.
[stuttering] Um, church.
Uh, whoa! What do we have here? Oh, nothing special, just some nutted quinoa, wilted broccolini with radish micro-greens, and venison carpaccio on a bed of nettles.
Grab a cedar plank and dig in.
Big change from Abuelita's cooking, huh? You like it? I can't wait to have eaten it.
I didn't think I would like nettles.
And I was right.
Well, I'm competing with perfection here.
It's okay, Schneider.
We all thank you for this very Caucasian meal.
And good to see you again, Elena's best friend, Carmen, you beautiful weirdo.
I'm sorry things got crazy the other night.
That's that's not us.
Seems like us.
We have all kinds of arguments in my family.
I have two brothers.
One's a priest, one's a witch, so I am really glad I'm getting to know you better, Carmen.
[door opens] Hello! - [Elena] Oh! - [Schneider] Oh, thank God! I am so glad you're home.
I was wilting under the pressure to be you.
Oh, hello, babies.
I'm sure you did fine.
Who threw up on the table? What were you doing all day? Oh, you know, saying my Rosary, praying for the departed souls Asking forgiveness for your mother.
- Mami.
- Why? Oh, didn't she tell you? She's no longer going to church.
Ever.
We can do that? You can't.
We will all go together.
Us.
Your mother will go hiking with Satan.
Yeah, and then we'll go to Applebee's.
'Cause Satan loves the Fiesta Lime Chicken! So, I guess you want to take my grandchildren to hell with you.
I don't wanna go to hell.
There is no hell.
Don't worry, papito, there is.
Okay! You you really wanna do this? All right, let's do this.
I am not even sure I even believe in God, okay? [all gasp] Hardcore.
Oye, you're so smart.
If God doesn't exist, who made all of this? Target.
Okay, can we agree that if there is a God, it's gender-neutral, not a he or a she? No! God is a man.
If he were a woman, there would be less problems.
Pobrecito God.
He tries so hard.
Look, Mami, I get it.
You like going to church.
It's habit.
You put on lipstick, you get dressed up, you see your friends, you gossip "Oye.
La nieta de Olguitita got new tetas.
" It's your little social club, Mami, and that's fine.
It is more than that.
I pray.
I seek forgiveness.
And I am so glad that that gives you comfort.
But that doesn't mean that God exists, okay? I'm sorry.
He kept you safe.
Every day that you were gone, he kept you safe.
My little girl says she wants to go in the Army, and then the Army sends her to Afghanistan where she is getting shot at and I don't even know what else Have you any idea how much I worried? When you were deployed, I went to church every day and I prayed that he would keep you safe.
[sniffles] And he did.
So don't you tell me about God.
I know that God exists.
And he is great.
[sobbing] Mami, I'm sorry.
- PerdÃ³n.
Lo siento.
- [sniffles] I had no idea.
You know, you went missing for one day and I was worried sick.
I can't imagine what it must feel like to worry all those years.
Ay, sÃ­.
All those years putting up with Birdie, with her terrible hairdos and her smelly bad breath.
[sobbing] - Look - [sniffles] I still wear the cross you gave me.
[gasps] So you do believe.
No, I don't wear it because it's a cross.
I wear it because you gave it to me.
I don't understand the difference, so please just let me have this.
- Okay.
- [both sobbing] So, are we going to church or not? Yes.
Wait, no.
Wait Sometimes, okay? - Sometimes, okay? - Yeah.
Well, at least at least Christmas and Easter.
[sniffles] And one other time, so we are not those people.
And I'm not saying God doesn't exist.
In fact, I check in with him constantly, you know, like, "Please, God, don't let Elena come home with a face tattoo.
" [exhales] And, Mami, I am glad that you find comfort in church.
I just find it in different places.
You know, once in Afghanistan I came out of 20 hours of surgery, and I was so tired.
I went into the break room and Serena Williams was on TV.
She was so focused.
She was making these impossible shots.
[stutters] And I just kept thinking about everything that she had to go through to get to where she is.
All the hours of sacrifice, all the practice.
And then I just felt like, "Okay if she can do that, then I can do this.
" That's how I feel when I watch John Cena.
Yes.
Exactly.
[stuttering] Exactly.
Or Sonia Sotomayor or Death.
Everyone has something that inspires them.
Yo entiendo.
[clicks tongue] I also play Nintendo.
[alarm beeps] [Latin music playing over stereo] [mouthing] - Good morning.
- [both] Morning.
[music continues playing]
 Uh This is my third coat, Jerry.
What do we think? Over the top, or just Cuban? Lady, you look great.
You better stop flirting with me, Jerry.
People don't hook up with their Uber driver, unless they want to be part of a very unfortunate story in the news.
But you're not gonna murder me and throw me in the trunk, right, Jer? Well, not now.
I needed that joke.
I'm a little hyped up, if you can't tell.
Take it easy.
It's just a first date.
Just have fun.
No pressure.
No pressure, Jerry? Mira, a first date is two hearts parched in the desert, quenching forever their thirst for amor.
Wait, what? Hold on.
- DÃ­game.
Mami, the story of when you and Papi first met.
Cuba, 1958.
You might wanna circle the block, Jerry.
It was a hot, steamy night, and I had borrowed my sister Maruchi's red dress.
And I had snuck into the Havana Club.
And the passion fell like rain drops.
And I was about to enter the heart of the hurricane.
And I'm circling the block.
I am Berto.
I was Lydia.
Now I am yours.
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.
How could you know? You've never left Cuba.
And now I never will.
What is it like to be so loved? You tell me.
I don't speak Spanish, but I know your date's not gonna be that good.
I know, Jerry! Thanks, Mami.
Claro, but I have to go.
Schneider's a wreck.
Tell it again.
Then my mom says, "NiÃ±a, your papi and I have a love that goes beyond death.
" You know, she still talks to him out loud.
He's dead, Jerry.
I'm kinda jealous of him.
Oh, Jerry, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm out.
You have a good night.
-And I'mma give you five stars.
-Thank you.
But I should give myself five stars for making it out of the house tonight.
I can't tell you what it took just to get to this moment.
But you're gonna, huh? Yesterday, I was in my office I'm a nurse.
I used to be in the Army, but I don't wanna get off track.
I'll tell you about that later.
Anyway, they start all this stuff about me being So, what's everybody got going on tonight? Any fun plans? I was thinking of walking the aisles at Target to see if I can make any new friends.
You wanna make new friends, you ought to come to the bowling alley, and watch me crush some pins.
That's a good Oh, you're serious? Well, what about you, Penelope? Oh, you know, Mama got a big pile of bills with her name on it.
No, literally my name is on every bill.
Anyway, I'm just, you know, flying solo.
Penelope you are so brave.
What's happening? I mean, casting your man aside and striking out on your own.
At your age, I would literally kill myself.
Hmm I get why you'd wanna kill you.
It's not so bad out there for older singles like Penelope and me.
Ugh! I felt that one in the gut.
For starters, there are so many microwave meals now, and I dig 'em.
Sometimes when I wanna splurge, I get the Betty Crocker omelet for two, for one.
Doc, you're forgetting about the best part about being single.
Dating apps.
Oh, they're great.
There's guys like me out there.
Oh, I didn't know there was an app called "Disappointment.
" You gotta start dating again, Penelope.
Right now, while there's still barely time.
-I'm 38.
-I know.
Okay, okay! Everybody, I really appreciate all the advice but I'm good.
I don't need a date.
I was married to Victor for 17 years, and I'm loving not having a dude around.
Excuse me.
I guess there are some things I miss.
I have a package for Penelope Alvarez.
What? Why why is everybody laughing? That's me.
Sign here.
Okay.
-Penelope.
-That's my name.
I'll remember now.
Thank you.
Oh, my God! You saw that? You saw that! I still got it! I still got it.
Yes! And there are hot men out there with big packages and you know whose name is on those big packages? Mine.
So, yeah, I still got it, Michelle, but for how long? Because let's face it, Lori's right, when it comes to dating, 38 is basically sixty in lady years.
I'm the Dr.
Berkowitz of women.
I don't know what that means, but it sounds sad.
Dr.
Berkowitz is my boss, remember, Michelle? I'm about to have my first date in 20 years, and right now you're my therapist, so I need you to keep up.
-Can I get a beer? -No, she's busy.
Let me explain what you're looking at.
I'm a snowman.
I don't wanna be racist, but does that mean coke dealer? Snowman means, right now, I look good, because it's still winter and everything is where it's supposed to be, but spring is a comin', girl.
And all of this is about to melt.
That's silly.
You look amazing! Right now, but not for long.
I mean, I have one slight advantage, 'cause I got the Latina patina.
Because there's something about our skin, you know.
A white girl like yourself's gotta start worrying around 30.
-How old are you? -Thirty-three.
I'm sorry, honey.
But this is why I have to force myself out there to meet Adam Bennett.
-Gimme your vibe.
-Oh, hello.
He's cute, right? Yeah, yeah.
Maybe he's too cute.
Maybe he won't think I'm cute.
Maybe I'm not even a snowman anymore.
Maybe I've melted.
Michelle! Am I just a puddle, a carrot, and a magic hat? -Oh, no, I can't.
-It's not for you.
I don't know why I'm so freaked out! I was fine yesterday.
How the hell do I do this? Do I like? Do I swipe? Do I put someone in my cart? It's like watching a baby bird learn to fly.
Everybody I know is either married or I'm too embarrassed to ask them.
So, you were my only option.
I hear ya.
And I'm honored.
- Help.
- All right, all right.
Are you sure you wanna do the online thing? For you, I'd recommend a more old-fashioned approach.
Go to a coffee shop, make eye contact with an appealing stranger, then, follow them home.
-Follow them home? -Yeah.
Or to their car.
You could try a bathroom stall, but that's a little sketch.
I mean, listen, you do you, but you're a mother now.
I'm not looking to have sex with someone.
Yeah, let's not put that in your profile.
I get it, you mean a real date.
Yes, it's been 20 years.
You know, back then, online dating meant hooking up while waiting in line to buy Boyz II Men tickets.
I helped turn a couple of boys to men.
Okay.
Okay.
Ooh, ooh, use this picture for my profile.
I look cute there.
So do your kids.
No one wants to see your kids.
That's, like, a second date revealer.
If you're good, a never reveal.
Right, right, lie about everything.
This is good.
Do you have some paper so I could write this down? I'm just gonna do a little Photoshop, replace the kids with a bicycle, so he thinks you exercise.
And we're live.
Okay, what about this guy? He went to Brown.
Yeah, but he's posing with a tiger.
Yeah, but he's holding nunchucks, so he's awesome! But not for you.
Okay.
You might also want to avoid guys who post their abs, but not their face.
And anyone who says they're an entrepreneur.
What does your profile say? I am an entrepreneur.
Okay, what about this guy? He's a cop.
Okay, a guy in uniform.
I'm not uninterested.
He has nice eyes.
"Adam Bennett.
" And you have a date tonight.
-No, wait, what? That was too fast.
-No, you're too slow.
He's probably already forgotten about your date and moved on to someone whose bicycle isn't wearing sneakers.
I'm really bad at Photoshop.
Come on, Pen, you doing this or not? Okay, you know what? I realized I I didn't think this through at all.
I I mean, my mom still thinks I'm married, so, you know, she's gonna lose her mind and Elena might be okay, but Alex, he's still so young and this could definitely mess with him.
I don't think I should do it.
If my family finds out, it'll be a disaster.
Maybe just don't tell 'em? Genius! Let's do this thing! Set it up for tomorrow, 7:30.
Both kids are busy.
-And, Schneider? -Yeah? -Schneider.
Hey! -Yeah.
-All right.
-Look at me in the eye here.
Okay? My mom, Elena, Alex Nobody can know.
Hey, don't worry, I'll be way too busy to tell them.
Just texted nunchucks guy and I think we're gonna hang.
So then I was like, "Let's do this thing!" I went to Sephora, and bought a tube of mascara, so I could get a free makeover.
Hey, did you know that mascara's, like, 14 bucks now? Mine was 36.
Shut your face, my new best friend, Abby! Hey, can I get that toilet paper I asked for five minutes ago? Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
Found a jumpsuit for 40 bucks that shows off the girls! Talking about my boobs, Abby! Anyway curled, sprayed, plucked.
Abby, I am hairless.
And I am here.
Oh, man.
I even shaved my lady 'stache.
- Wait, you can do that? - Yes.
It doesn't grow back thicker.
That's a myth started by Big Wax.
Oh, look at me.
Uh when I met my ex, I was wearing sneaks, jeans, a tit tank and a flannel.
I know, it was a better time.
Wait, are you okay? I'm sorry, I thought my boyfriend, Benji, was going to propose to me tonight and he didn't.
All right, come on, Abby.
Open up.
We gotta hug this out.
Are you kidding me? What? Sweetheart, look at you! Don't take this the wrong way, but your problems are nothing.
Yeah, wow! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I just mean that Benji is just a bump in what is obviously going to be a very smooth and luxurious road.
Whoever you marry, he'll be rich.
And you'll probably end up being one of those Real Housewives ladies.
And anyway, this is like 20 years from now because you're a child.
A tall, hot child! Do you really think that I could be one of the Real Housewives? I know you can.
And now, I'm gonna say to you what I wish my mother would have said to me before my date.
Good luck.
Thanks! Wait, I thought your family didn't know.
Oh, I didn't tell you what my mother said? Red lipstick is for putas.
What? I'm just saying you should wear red lipstick for your encounter tonight.
-Damn it, Schneider.
-No, Schneider didn't say anything.
I know because you obviously shaved your moustache.
Was it that bad? Ay, niÃ±a, I felt like braiding it.
Anyway.
I'm just having dinner, okay? And I'm not being a puta.
No, you're a married woman, who is going out on a date with a man who is not your husband.
What is the right word? Let me see Uh, sucia? Tramp? No.
Ah, of course, hoochie.
I am separated.
And I'm not having this conversation.
And keep your voice down because the kids can't know.
Hey, you shaved your 'stache! What's going on? Do you have a date? How is everybody figuring this out so fast? I didn't want you to worry, so I didn't wanna tell you.
It's just dinner.
Mom, I'm fine! I mean, I thought it was cool that you were blurring gender lines with your upper lip but this is great! Okay, mostly what I'm hearing is I have to up my grooming game.
But you're you're really okay? Of course.
I mean, it's well-documented that women in their late 30s are in their sexual prime.
- Ay, Elena.
Please.
You're too okay with it.
And don't tell Alex.
- I mean it.
- Please.
First of all, I'm not a gossip and if I were, it wouldn't be to my little brother about my mom's love life.
Am I in trouble? No.
We're we're just thinking.
Mmm.
Well, when you're done thinking, can I have $100? What? I don't know, I need money for tonight because me and my friends are going bowling.
Or miniature golfing.
Or to the arcade.
I don't know, just give me $100! Uh, okay.
First of all, you need a plan.
Second of all, I need to approve the plan, and third of all, 100 bucks? That was funny.
No Stupid Finn keeps changing his mind.
First he invites Joaquin.
Then he has to invite Jade because he invited Joaquin.
Then she wants to bring JuJu and Casey and Maddie.
I don't know any of these people! We need to talk more! Don't talk to him.
-He cannot know about this date.
-Whoa! Okay, okay! Dios mÃ­o.
So weird.
I was dying to tell him.
I'm, like, buzzing.
Is this what gossip is? Who am I? Abuelita is talking to ghost Abuelito again.
I'm not talking to you.
So, does Papi think I'm a puta, too? Ay, no seas ridÃ­cula, your papi would never say those things about you.
Only I think that.
Also, you're sitting on him.
I'm doing this.
Come on, Mami, it would be nice to have your support.
I suppose there is nothing wrong with having dinner with a friend who is a man, so Thank you.
If you wanna have a second dinner, wear the red lipstick.
I actually don't own one.
You can borrow mine.
So, I finally forced myself out of the house and overcame an expected, yet still surprisingly strong anxiety attack.
Now I'm here.
Your waiter will be with you in a minute.
Thanks, Kristen.
We didn't get a chance to talk much, but you seem cool.
Hi, I'm Tyler.
I'll be taking care of you tonight.
I know you're waiting for one more, but can I start you off with an appetizer? No, you can start me off with a drink.
Because, Tyler, I went through hell to get here tonight.
Every aspect of this date has been dissected by all the people in my life.
My mom, my daughter, my landlord, some giant, hot baby in the bathroom.
Have you seen her, by the way? Please tell me she's eating something.
The point is, everybody had an opinion about this.
Okay.
So, uh, do you know what you want? Of course.
Why wouldn't you two be waiting for me? I thought you had a thing with Carmen.
I came home early so we could all dish.
CuÃ©ntanos de todo.
Did he have soulful eyes? Were his teeth white, but not too white? Now the teeth are too white.
What is that? He was very nice.
And I'm glad I did it.
But, uh, wasn't two hearts in the desert like you and Papi.
Aw! Yeah, I'm not gonna see him again.
See who? You didn't wanna give me the heads-up that he was here? Heads-up, Alex is here.
Wait, why are you wearing Abuelita's lipstick? -Ay.
-Why do you know that? It's Scarlet Sunrise.
Duh! And why are you all dressed up? All right, everybody, get out of here, so I can talk to Alex.
Sit down, papito.
-What happened to your face? -What happened to your face? I'm sorry.
I was hanging out with my friends.
It's hard to turn it off.
Anyway, stupid Finn pushed me into a bush and I got scratched.
Why do you like that kid again? Because he seems like a-- Like a dick? Yes, but that's not okay that you said that.
Anyway, I wanna be straight with you.
Tonight I had a date.
Wait, just listen.
So, do you know what you want? -Let me give you a second.
-Thank you.
You walked out? I don't want those gossiping hens to hear.
But yes No one has asked me what I wanted in a long time.
And I realized what I wanted wasn't a date.
Then what did you want? A crappy chick flick by myself.
And a fro-yo with three too many toppings.
The kind that I make you and Elena split.
Aw, man! Anyway, I sent the guy a text apologizing, but I want Abuelita to think that I went out with him, so that next time I don't get the third degree.
Next time? Yeah.
Because I'm pretty sure there's gonna be a next time at some point.
Are you okay with that? Yeah, I mean, I figured you would.
After all, women in their late 30s are in their sexual prime.
Oh, God! What? Stop talking to your sister.
Tell her to stop talking to me! Anyway, dating is super weird.
I know! I know Why do you know? My dumb friends have been trying to get me and this girl, Anna, together.
Oh, I see.
So, what happened tonight was Finn made a plan.
Then everybody bailed on purpose, so Anna and I could be alone.
Okay.
I mean, I like Anna, but I don't really want a girlfriend.
It was like everyone had something to say about it, but me.
That's exactly how I felt.
And you're right, dating is super weird, until it's not.
Something else you wanna talk to me about? Well, I kinda lied to you.
Oh, God, what is it? Did you steal something? Did you damage something? Did you pee on something 'cause you were mad and then later you were, like, "I shouldn't have done that"? No! Who does that? These are just general examples.
What did you do? This isn't because Finn pushed me into a bush.
I tried to shave.
Really? Oh, my God.
It's all happening.
So you don't want a girlfriend, but you did wanna look nice.
I guess.
I used one of your razors and cut myself.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I think I know someone who can help you out.
I am a Latina, you are a 12-year-old boy, so we have the same amount of facial fuzz.
Okay.
Watch and learn.
You wanna go with the hair.
Uh-huh.
Now that I'm shaving, it's gonna grow back thick, right? No, that's a myth.
Aw, man! Hola, mi vida.
Berto, you look guapÃ­simo in that suit.
Which is why you buried me in it.
So, Lupe did not go on that date.
-Â¿QuÃ©? -Mmm-hmm.
-You told me she was going.
-Oh, she lied.
Mentirosa.
She said she went, but when she got home, she wasn't super happy, she wasn't super sad.
And I know our Lupe.
There was no date.
What are we going to do about our niÃ±a? Dichoso tÃº, you don't have to do anything.
Lo siento, mi amor.
Yeah, you don't look that sorry.
Â¿QuÃ© puedo hacer? Bertito they broke the mold when they made you.
Now you're just being nice.
I'm not that nice.
That's why I married you.
Little aloe vera on your upper lip and you're good to go.
I can't wait until I have more hair than you.
Me neither! What's Abuelita doing? She's on a date.
Aw.
The day every mother dreams of, when her daughter grows a vampire head.
Hi, Ms.
Alvarez.
We were working really hard on our immigration project for school, so we took a little power nap.
Oh, 9:00 to 3:00 workday getting you down? Yeah.
I take power naps, too.
It's called blinking.
[snores and gasps] I'm so refreshed.
- Oh, can Carmen stay for dinner? - Of course.
Thanks, Ms.
Alvarez.
Carmen's staying for dinner.
[Lydia] It's okay.
Schneider is staying, too.
See? We take in all strays.
Except for cats.
They steal your breath and turn you into a cucuy.
Let's be happy Elena finally has a real friend, you know, and not someone from the Internet who'd probably end up being a 35-year-old man.
Under all that makeup, who knows? Mami, I am serious, okay? Carmen gets straight A's.
All they do is study.
Pero still, that friendship is a little bit, eh, cÃ³mo se dice? Intense.
They're teenage girls.
Yeah, but no, no, no.
I think there's something a little bit, uh, queer.
[laughs] What? I don't even think you know what that word means.
Oh, I know.
You said the same thing about me and Kathy Trecker, because we started sharing clothes and we both wanted to marry Ricky Martin? See? Queer.
You know what? You got us.
Kathy, come out of the bedroom! [laughs sarcastically] - [chuckles] - Look at you.
In a good mood, huh? [chuckles] It's the drugs, isn't it? Definitely.
But also, Dr.
Berkowitz's birthday party.
I got it all planned out.
Apparently, last year, he ended up at Medieval Times by himself.
Oh.
He went to pet a horse and got bit.
[both laughing] Pobrecito.
So I got Scott and Lori to get balloons and a cake.
So, I got everything covered.
Glad you're here.
It's baseball fundraiser time again.
Abuelita, these are for you to sell at church.
And, Mom, I guess at work, or wherever you go? Deadline is Friday.
Most sales gets a PlayStation.
So let's really get after it, people.
Ooh, got a great idea.
Sell them yourself.
Go! Go out in the neighborhood.
Sell them out there.
Aren't you worried about predators? I'm very cute.
I'm not worried.
Your abuelita will be three feet behind you at all times.
Come on.
Work up a good sales pitch.
It'll be so much more gratifying if you earn that PlayStation yourself.
[groans] This is the worst.
There's my little go-getter! Hey, Mom, can Carmen stay overnight? We're having so much fun.
Why doesn't she sleep out here on el sofÃ¡? It will be more comfortable than the floor.
Oh, she just sleeps in bed with me.
I'm not saying anything.
Good.
'Cause everyone should feel at home here.
[sighs] Hey, guys.
I fixed the water pressure and tested it.
Hey, let's push dinner a smidge, okay? Ooh, rice again? Can we not? I'm doin' a little Paleo thing right now.
Also, I borrowed your nail clippers.
See you in 20.
I think peoples feel at home.
[theme song playing in Spanish] [laughing] Hey.
Hey.
Where have you two been? Where's the cake? Where are the balloons? [both] Oh Sorry, I forgot to get the balloons last night.
So why didn't you get them on your way in? I didn't wanna be late.
- But you are late! - But I didn't want to be.
You know what's weird? The bakery where you told me to pick up the cake? [laughing] I was there getting coffee this morning.
Okay, this? This right here is why we have two stars on Yelp.
Are you guys getting any service? I haven't gotten a birthday call or e-mail or text.
- Well, the office is kind of a dead spot.
- I've got four bars! - My daughter did call.
- There you go.
She wanted my Netflix password.
My birthday didn't come up, and my password is my birthday! But at least you guys remembered.
Uh, I believe I said grocery store sheet cake? You guys forgot, too? No, we we didn't forget.
"Y birthday"? Well said, banner.
Well said.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[stammers] I have, um [snaps fingers] You got me.
I was trying to keep it a surprise.
I am having you over for a birthday dinner.
- Tonight? - Tonight? - I'm free! - Great! Tonight! It's happening! So it's a party? I can invite all my friends? Uh, sure.
Great! Lori, Scott, want to come to my birthday party? No, no, not them.
I mean, I'm sure they're busy.
Nope.
My husband has couples counseling with the dog, so I'm free.
I got kicked off Tinder, so so am I.
So, it's gonna be this.
But in my home? Great! All right, I got the party box.
I got some, uh, birthday candles, party hats.
This cowboy stuff is no good to me.
Oh, look, look.
Decorative plates left over from Lisette's baby shower.
They say, "It's a boy," so, technically, it works.
Okay.
Give me a status report.
Rice is on the stove, costillas in the marinade, and I look fantastic! Schneider! Where's that centerpiece you promised me? The gourd is drying, as is the glitter.
Got away from me a little bit, I'm not gonna lie.
Sounds like a train wreck.
Go get it.
Oh, no, no, Alex, you gotta put that away.
You said I have to sell them.
We're about to have a house full of customers.
Oh, you know what? They got money.
Clean 'em out, papito.
- I made my sangria.
- Two pitchers? Last time I drank that, I woke up naked in the tub with a French braid.
And I don't know how to French braid.
Don't worry.
It's going to be a very classy night.
Papito, crawl onto the fire escape and put this on the grill.
Oh, oh, and take this stick in case of the raccoon.
Oh, Carmen.
We're taking a little break from our immigration project.
We're really hitting a wall.
[chuckles] You're not as funny as your mom.
Guys, guys, oh, my I'm sorry.
I'm throwing a sad man a stupid party.
[chuckles] It's gonna make him really happy, but I don't think Carmen needs to be around for it.
- What? - Hey! Elena, it's fine.
I'll go get my stuff.
No, no, no.
It's not fine.
She has to stay.
This isn't fair! She's been here most of the week.
Can she only survive in this apartment's atmosphere? - You guys can take the night off.
- No! You better watch that attitude.
This is not a big deal, so why are you making it one? And during the party, you can't just hide in your room.
- You have to participate.
- Why? Because I am raising a polite human person.
And if I don't get to hide in my room, no one does.
It's cool.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be any trouble.
No, honey, no.
You're not trouble.
The trouble's arriving in ten minutes.
I'm sparing you, trust me.
[sighs] Text me later, okay? You know I will.
I feel like I'm watching the end of Titanic.
Queer.
Ugh.
That's the centerpiece? It's not his memorial service.
You only gave me five hours and no theme.
- [knock on door] - Oh, God damn it.
Okay.
- You know what? Just put it down.
- [grunts] Okay.
Okay.
Now listen.
This is a very sweet and lonely guy.
I've seen him riding a tandem bicycle by himself.
Are we ready? Are we ready? EspÃ©rate, espÃ©rate.
Ay, ay! Dale.
[inhales sharply] Hey, welcome! - Hey! - How are you? I picked everybody up to make sure they'd come.
Great.
That's great.
Hi.
Happy birthday, Dr.
Berkowitz.
Oh, please, call me Leslie.
Why would I do that? That is a woman's name.
It is also my name.
Uh, that's too bad.
Brought you a bottle of wine somebody left at my house.
I don't do Zin.
Oh, hi, Alex! Hi, I'm Alex Alvarez.
Youth sports is one of the most important activities Okay, okay, okay.
Not yet, Willy Wonka.
Let them sit down.
And, uh, where is that delightful daughter of yours? Oh, yeah.
Elena! She is so excited about your party.
[all laughing] And then this one says, "Doc, that's not apple juice!" [all laughing] That is the last time I misplaced my glasses.
And just to be safe, I bought him a cup that says "not urine" on it.
- [all laughing] - Yeah, yeah.
So you don't drink el pee-pee.
[all laughing] I don't know if it's the sangria, but I am havin' a great time.
- [chuckles] It's the sangria.
- [laughing] Good thing you drove.
Unless somebody else wants to give me a ride? [laughs] Oh, I am flattered, married lady.
Always interesting to be the sober one at a dinner party.
Now if memory serves, next stage is dancing.
[gasps] That's a great idea! Whoo-hoo! We should probably put some music on to make this less weird.
No, let this ride a while.
[sighs] It makes me sad to see Americanos dance.
I've got the looks I've got the body, yeah Mom, I got this.
Hi, I'm Alex Alvarez.
Youth sports is one of the most important activities in building character I'll buy five.
[chuckles] [whispers] We can share.
Oh, that's really sweet, but I'm kinda doing a little Paleo thing right now.
- Ooh.
It's working.
[chuckles] - Okay.
This is so much fun, Penelope.
Well, I'm glad you're having a good time.
But it's not over yet.
Happy birthday to you [laughs] [all singing] Happy birthday to No, no.
Just me.
[singing] Happy birthday To ju Is she singing "to Jew"? Doesn't matter.
It works both ways.
Happy birthday, Leslie Berkowitz Happy birthday To ju I, uh, want to thank all of you, uh, especially Penelope, for this day.
And thank you for making me feel like I belong.
[chuckles] Ah, y? Are you going to blow out the candles? If I don't, maybe this moment will last forever.
Aw.
But it won't.
Blow them out.
- [blows] - Bravo! [all cheering] All right.
Is it over? Can I go to my room now? Please, Elena, lighten up.
We did a good thing here.
Have some cake.
Forget about Carmen for one second.
[Elena sighs] - Oh, Mami, you forgot the knife.
- Ah.
- [Lori gasps] - [Penelope] Where's that cake knife? Remember the fancy one we borrowed from Marie Callender's? There's a Walking Dead on your fire escape! Is this part of my birthday, like a singing Grim Reaper? You guys are the best! No, Dr.
Berkowitz, that's actually Elena's friend.
I don't get it.
Why was Carmen trying to come in through the window? Yeah, that was a little, uh Queer? You come here.
Is is everything all right? Yeah, everything is great.
Mami, cut the cake, please.
And, uh, you guys go ahead and eat.
- What are you two trying to pull? - Nothing.
[sighs] You don't understand.
Text her.
Make sure she gets home okay.
And after the party, we're gonna talk about you and Carmen.
Oh, now that I've bought all this candy, I'd love to come see some of your ballgames.
Uh, that'd be weird.
He sounds just like my kids.
[Penelope chuckles] I'm sorry, everyone.
It's, uh, teenage girls, you know.
Everything is very dramatic.
It must be about a boy.
[sing-song] I don't think so.
No, I think they're both stressed about their big immigration project for school.
Immigration project? Why haven't they come to me? Why would they go to you? Oh, boy.
[sighs] Well, there's no stoppin' now.
- [exhales] - What's happening? I immigrated here illegally.
I'm a Canadian.
[mocks gasping] Shocking! I know.
Oh, I thought you were all gonna do that.
So, you're an illegal alien? Well, we prefer "undocumented.
" But yeah, born in the 'Couve, overstayed my student visa, forced to live in the shadows of Pepperdine University.
Took me a while to get rid of the accent, but now I can say [in exaggerated American accent] I am sorry about that.
Wow.
You must have been very brave, Schneider, coming here with everything.
Knowing only the entire language and struggling to unlearn the metric system.
I sense a liter of sarcasm.
Anyway, it's fine now.
My lawyers made it all okay.
- Well, that's good.
- [Schneider] Yeah.
But if you wanna hear a real immigration story Havana, 1962.
I came here as a child, fleeing an oppressive regime, with only my natural charm and perfect legs.
Here she goes.
And you know, it was written that I was Cuba's greatest dancer.
Whoa.
Who wrote that? Just because I wrote it, doesn't mean it wasn't true.
I bet you were fabulous.
Oh, completamente.
And then [sighs] Castro.
- Mmm.
- La RevoluciÃ³n.
The Catholic Church had a program called Pedro Pan that invited the Cuban children to come over.
And they gave us our papers.
And I RSVP'd "Yes.
" It's my little joke.
There was no RSVP.
[all laughing] Oh, that's great.
At least you did it the right way.
Oh, Scott.
[chuckles] Don't ruin the night by being you.
I'm just being honest.
There's a right way and a wrong way, and a lot of people are doing it the wrong way.
How come when people say, "I'm just being honest," something terrible always comes next? You know, it's never like, "Hey, I'm just being honest.
You look hot.
" I said that to you once.
You got mad at me.
Because it was in the workplace.
Do you understand anything? - So I can say it now? - Technically, but don't.
Such stimulating dinner party repartee.
Anyway, what's so wrong about saying people should follow the rules? You wanna come to America, get in line.
Oh, the one that's ten years long, full of hard-working people that'll do jobs that some Americans won't do? Like picking fruit? Or remembering to buy balloons and a cake for a birthday party? [crying] I'm so sorry.
- Oh, yeah, we're at this stage now.
- [continues crying] The next stage can't happen! It's just the country's full up.
Like a bar.
It was free before 8:00 p.
m.
, but now you gotta pay a cover.
Sorry, but we can't just take everybody.
- [scoffs] - El bobo is right.
- What? - Everyone should follow the rules.
I did, Schneider did.
I did not, actually.
Lot of lawyers, lot of fines.
Mami, seriously? What you went through was terrible.
But at least, you had a place to go, and you were welcomed with open arms.
There are persecuted people all around the world who would love the opportunity to come here, but they can't.
Because the rules are different for different people.
So some of them break the law and they do what they have to do to fight for better lives for themselves and their families.
And you know what? I get it.
Mom? Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah.
Uh, excuse me, I'll be right back.
[Elena sighs] Carmen's in my room right now.
What? Elena! - She has nowhere else to go.
- What are you talking about? Where are her parents? Mexico.
They were deported.
[sighs] All right, stay here.
Hey, everyone.
[chuckles] We had a lot of fun, but it is a school night.
And it's way past the kids' bedtime.
Okay, okay.
There's nothing worse than a guest who overstays his welcome.
But I did notice a Monopoly board.
[chuckles] You know what? Let's just wrap this up.
We really should.
Okay, they're gone.
Lori threw up, but the good news is she made it to the hall, so it's a Schneider problem.
[sighs] What do I do? Do I drive you somewhere? Is there a detention center? Pero, uh, quÃ© pasÃ³? My dad got sick, and they heard about this doctor that helps undocumented people.
But he was south of the checkpoint.
Her parents got picked up coming back.
- [gasps] - Ay, niÃ±a.
[Lydia] Dios mÃ­o.
So, the immigration project? I am the immigration project.
I was too scared to tell you.
I I'm sorry I lied.
[clicks tongue] You gotta tell me stuff, even if it's not great.
Especially if it's not great.
We take care of people.
That's what our family does, right? Right.
- When did this happen? - Two weeks ago.
Two weeks? So have you been staying here this whole time? Yeah.
Most nights after dinner, I leave and I sneak back up through the fire escape.
[Lydia] Oh.
Are you the raccoon? Yeah.
But I felt really bad that we didn't tell you guys.
So I've been trying to help out around here.
That's why I did the laundry and reorganized the pantry.
Oh, was that you? [gasps] Alphabetical order.
I love it.
That was very sweet of you, Carmen.
But I wish you would've come to me.
How long did you think you could keep this up? A year.
What? [scoffs] We're gonna need more rice.
She wants to graduate with her class.
And she was born here.
She's never even been to Mexico, not even Cabo.
My parents didn't do anything wrong.
They both work two jobs.
I'm on scholarship at St.
B's, and I get good grades.
We're a normal American family.
We had tickets to see Frozen on Ice.
You like Frozen? Sometimes the skaters fall.
[chuckles] Have you been able to speak to your parents? Yeah.
[sniffles] What do they say you should do? They said I'm supposed to go to my brother's in Texas.
Well, then I think that's what you need to do, Carmen.
No Mom! Texas? The worst place on the planet? - He lives in Austin.
- Austin! Actually, I hear Austin's pretty chill.
You can stay with us until we figure out how to get you to Austin, okay? But you need to be with your family.
[sniffles] I can't believe they sent your parents back home.
They didn't send them home.
They sent them away.
[both crying] Okay, guys.
I think it's time to leave.
Carmen.
This is my favorite duffel.
It got me through war, and I'm pretty sure it'll get you through Austin.
Inside are some shirts and jeans, and I'm guessing you might be interested in my old combat boots.
The ones I shined last week? Shut your face hole! Yeah.
And, um, it's not much, but it'll buy you a cauldron and a wand.
I'm gonna miss this.
I'm gonna miss this, too.
Mmm.
But know that you'll always have a place to park your broom.
- You know - [sniffling and crying] This is like when I had to say goodbye to my friends in Cuba.
And my papi said, "Keep it together for your mami, or she will be so upset.
" And then my mami said, "Keep it together for your papi.
" So be a good friend, mmm? Think how difficult this must be for her.
SÃ© fuerte.
[knock on door] - Hey, Schneider.
- Hi.
Thanks for taking me to the airport and for buying the ticket.
God bless white guilt.
Or is it Canadian goodness? [in heavy Canadian accent] Well, a little of both, eh? [in American accent] Damn it! Here you go.
On me.
Well, on the weird blonde lady who forgot to take them home.
Thanks, Alex.
Thank you, seÃ±ora.
I'll text you from the airport.
Text me from Schneider's car.
You know I will.
[both crying] [sniffles] I thought you said I was supposed to keep it together! [both crying] Well, that's you.
[crying] We can do whatever we want.
Mom, I'm gonna miss the first pitch.
Go faster! Alex, you know Mrs.
Resnick doesn't go faster.
Unless we're going downhill, and then she might not stop.
We are so late.
Just try.
Mom, I smell gas.
All right.
Now, you smell Hawaii.
Maybe the car's bad 'cause papi stuck it with the name Mrs.
Resnick.
You know your papi named her after a hot teacher he had a crush on.
Yeah, but by now I bet Mr.
Resnick's traded her in for a younger model.
That's not funny, papito.
It's not funny.
Society treats middle-aged women shamefully.
I read a study online Okay, who wants to hear some tunes? No! Don't leave me in all this pain Don't leave me out in the rain Aw, right before the good part.
There is no good part.
That CD's been stuck in this car my whole life.
Uh, excuse me? It's a cassingle.
Why are we slowing down? Who turned on the AC? You know Mrs.
Resnick can't handle that! I'm sorry, but it's 90 degrees and you won't let us roll the windows down.
Because then they don't go back up.
And it's only a crime to leave children in a hot car if it's parked.
I looked it up! Great.
Okay, guys.
You know the drill.
Por favor, Santa Francisca de Roma, ayÃºdanos.
Uno, dos y tres.
See? Mrs.
Resnick's still got it.
Ugh.
Well it'll probably be 20 minutes before a tow-truck gets here.
So, what should we do to pass the time? Oh, I know.
break my heart Say you'll love me again Everybody! Undo this hurt you caused Oh, hello.
What are you doing, Mami? This is supposed to make your skin glow.
It's called a sheet mask.
Mami, sheet.
It's called a sheet mask.
That's what I said, sheet.
So, would you say you are sheet-faced right now? Ah! Stop or the sheet will hit the fan.
You are back so late, I decided to have a little me time.
Can you feel it working? Hey, guys.
Oh! And we are 29 again.
Where you guys been? Mrs.
Resnick broke down again and had to be towed to the mechanic.
Hector's looking at it now.
Oh, how is Hector? I feel like I haven't seen him for days.
Did he ask about me? Oh, papito.
What happened to your pants? I ripped them getting out of the trunk.
You keep him in the trunk now? No, the doors got stuck again so we all had to climb out through the back.
It was terrible.
Now the whole team calls me "Butt-trunk boy.
" They could've called me "Junk in the trunk," it was right there.
Oh.
Oh, guys.
This is Hector.
Hector Hector! Hello, give me some good news.
What? No! Okay, well, what exactly needs replacing? Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, what about Oh, huh.
Uh-huh? Oh, you saved the cassingle! It unspooled.
That's okay, Hector, no.
Um, thank you.
Thank you.
Guys, Mrs.
Resnick is Muerta.
I can't believe it.
You know, your papi picked me up for our first date in that car.
It was brand new.
Only 60,000 miles on it.
We drove Mrs.
Resnick up the coast and at sunset, your papi bet me $5 that he'd marry me.
He even wrote our initials in a little heart on the bill.
I still have it somewhere.
Aw, you never take us to Malibu.
That's what you got from that story? Yeah, but the good news is you're getting a new car, right? Oh, sure, I'll just have the butler pick it up.
Oh, butlers work at the estate.
Chauffeurs pick up cars.
Lupe, if you need money for a car, I am here to help.
I will teach dance again! It is a gift that I have withheld from the world far too long.
She taught me how to salsa.
She was amazing.
I do it for the joy.
You owe me $30.
Okay, well, why don't we take public transportation and reduce our carbon footprint? It's the best way to save money, and besides, I don't want you to have to go into my college fund.
College fund? You see that dish of change by the door? That's your college fund.
Well, not the quarters, 'cause I need that for laundry.
Elena, mi niÃ±a, a family needs a car.
In Cuba, my best memories are the long rides with my papi in a Chevy the size of this apartment.
It was glorious.
His beloved little daughter on one side and on the other, his beloved bottle of rum.
That sounds dangerous.
No, no, no, no, we didn't have seat belts then.
We would just roll out quick.
Well, I'm going to start taking public transportation, you know, to help atone for the environmental devastation that my ancestors and their gas-guzzlers so cruelly left to this earth.
Why does everything have to be a crusade that is also annoying? Abuelita's right.
We need a car, but we can't afford a car.
Unless we get a crazy good deal, which means we're screwed, because car salesmen are scary.
But not to you.
You were in the Army! Yeah, you're always saying you're a "badass.
" I am a badass! But I'm also kind of a scaredy cat, you know, because I never bought a car before, you know? That salesman is gonna see me coming a mile away.
Then he's gonna do that thing where he talks to the guy.
And then they're gonna say something about floor mats, and then, "blah, blah, blah," I wake up in an ice tub, because someone took my kidneys.
I am a total stereotype.
A woman that doesn't know anything about cars.
It would be so much easier if Victor were here.
I hate to say this, but this is husband work.
Okay, Mom, this is not just a car anymore.
It is the symbol of the oppression that the bonds of marriage have placed upon you as a woman.
You can do this.
- So you are for the car now? - No! But as a crusade, yes.
Annoying.
- Yeah, I can do this.
Yes.
Yes.
- Yes! 'Course you can, you just need to do a little research.
In the meantime, I'll take Alex to baseball.
Gives me a reason to break out the athleisure wear.
What the hell is that? It's workout clothes you cannot sweat in.
My car broke down yesterday and I have to buy a new one.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I hate car dealerships.
I went to buy my daughter an inexpensive car, and she drove off in a BMW! And then I had to buy it! Very hard to negotiate when the car's halfway to Vegas.
Well, I'm feeling pretty good, 'cause I spent all last night - learning about cars.
- Oh! Oh! Can you tell me what "anti-lock brakes" are? I mean, why should they ever lock? I believe you're talking about ABS.
Which is just a system that allows the wheels to maintain tractive control during sudden stops! What? What? Very impressive! Uh, do you know how to repo a BMW? No, but I am very proud of myself, because this is my first big purchase without Victor.
Yeah, girl! You don't need no man! Ooh! Actually, I do.
Apparently when a woman goes to a dealership without a man, they are quoted a higher price.
So I was thinking, maybe you can come with me and pretend to be my - Husband? - I was gonna say "dad," but sure I am in! Great! That's so great! We're gonna go tomorrow, okay? I am out! I I can't do tomorrow.
It has to be tomorrow.
It's the end of the month and it's the best time to negotiate.
I'm sorry, I'm seeing my daughter for the first time in ages, and she's bringing her therapist, and lawyer and life coach.
It's going to be so good to see these people I've been paying.
You're home later than usual.
Saving the world takes time.
You know I used all public transportation today.
I went to school, I went to the library.
I came home.
Zero carbon footprint.
Zero interesting words.
Come on, abuelita, I saw beautiful parts of the city, I talked to fascinating people, and I pushed myself outside my comfort zone.
When's the last time you did that? When I moved here as a 15-year-old girl without my family and not speaking the language.
Is that well ever gonna run dry? They took our well! Anyways, I explored the city today, too, when I was putting up my fliers, so I may teach the world to dance again.
There's a part of you that actually thinks the world stopped dancing when you quit teaching, isn't there? Yes.
- Mom, today was the best day.
- Ooh! Everyone saw me in Schneider's Range Rover and thought I was a total pimp! Mmm.
Don't say pimp or you'll get grounded! Seriously, Mom, his car is amazing.
The seats warm up.
You wouldn't think you want a warm butt but you totally do.
It's all the best parts of peeing your pants without any of the wetness.
You should've seen Schneider.
The other parents were obsessed.
Connie Merkelson told me she's never seen anybody slice apples with such grace.
Not gonna lie, she was throwing me some red hot heat.
Connie Merkelson is a gay lady.
But thank you for taking Alex.
And actually, I have another favor to ask.
Okay, but with Connie I think she might walk both sides of the street.
I'm gonna stay on the case.
Tomorrow I'm gonna buy a car, and so that I don't get screwed, I need a male presence to pretend to be my - Son? - Really? You're older than me.
I was gonna say husband.
Oh! A May-December thing.
Gross, but okay.
So I know you've been doing your research.
- What's our play? - You don't talk.
- Arm candy.
I hear ya.
- Yeah.
I'm just gonna walk up to that salesman, I'm gonna look him in the eye and I'm gonna say, "Here's what's up.
" You're gonna sell me a 2012 pre-owned Honda CR-V, low mileage, no upsell, for the bluebook price, "or I will burn this building down!" Save that fire for the bedroom, babe.
You're comin' on way too strong.
No, I gotta be tough.
They gotta see that I ain't no punk.
Hey, they also gotta see that you didn't just get out of a women's prison.
Look, you know your stuff.
Just throw in a little charm.
For example, I have my own little secret weapon.
Whoopsies! What? Guess who just got a large latte for the price of a small? I'm trying to buy a car, not impress a white girl with dreadlocks who likes flat asses.
I'm just saying, I got tricks to get people on my side.
What are you bringing to the table? Playing the veteran card is genius.
Hey! I earned this guilt.
But, yeah, I kinda feel sorry for the salesman.
Beautiful lady veteran, you're gonna own this guy.
Hey, folks.
I'm Jill.
Can I answer any questions for you? I got this! Whoopsie! Damn it, that's a Montblanc! Oh, yeah That's my husband.
I married him for his flat ass.
I see you served.
Yes, I was an army medic in Afghanistan.
Yeah Ai, sorry, sorry! I sustained a shoulder injury in the field.
It was a difficult time, but I'm proud to serve my country.
- I hear what you're saying.
- Thank you.
Sergeant Riley.
I was a driver and gunner in Baghdad.
Hooah! Hooah.
Pardon me a second.
Hey, Michaels, step away from the donuts.
The customers need them and you definitely don't.
Schneider, she is not gonna give me any sympathy.
She's more badass than I am.
Yeah, I got bigger fish here, Penelope.
Anyway, this Honda CR-V is an LX.
It's got low mileage.
Five-star safety rating, ABS Which is different than EX, because it has smaller wheels and no fog lights, 'cause I ain't no punk! Oh, I'm sorry.
Somebody's been doing their research.
Well, you know what, I am a straight shooter.
I tell it like it is.
Then why are you lyin' about that guy being your husband? What, what? Come on! You served in the Army! You've trained to rappel out of helicopters.
And you're gonna tell me that you're married to that haircut? Do you guys have one of those grabber claw thingies? We're not married, I'm sorry.
It's just that my real husband and I are actually separated and this is my first big purchase without him.
I get it.
There's no reason you and I can't figure this out, just the two of us.
Oh, God.
Spider.
Spider! I'm glad we enlisted and not him.
So, mi niÃ±a how was the crusade today? Another great day on the bus.
Oh, which one did you take? Uh, the 60? That goes to Vernon? Oh, my favorite butcher is there.
I once saw a woman rip the weave off another woman over a leg of lamb.
It was me.
Well, Vernon's library is much better than ours.
My bus driver actually tipped me off.
- Georgie, Miguel or Petros? - Petros.
Petros only works on weekends.
Sorry, it was Miguel.
There is no Miguel.
I made him up.
What are you doing? What are you doing? Okay! I hate the bus! Whoa, what? I'm a fraud! I've been lying these past two days.
It's okay, we know! Public transportation is hard.
The seats are small, it kind of smells One time, I fell asleep and somebody stole my socks.
They left my shoes! Mi vida, it's not that bad.
Just yesterday, I took the bus to the farmer's market and then I went to collect on some bottles that I had saved.
Wait, so you used mass transit to shop for locally grown produce and then recycled? That's like triple fossil fuel savings.
Mmm.
Oh, my God! Abuelita's greener than you.
Well, abuelita, I guess you're my new hero.
Ah, Elena I've always been your hero.
Abuelita, what's this? That is the flier for my dance classes.
I've been hanging them all over the neighborhood.
"Experienced latina will make your body do things you didn't know it could"? What? It's true.
Abuelita, it's just the wording is kind of provocative.
As is the photo! Don't be ridÃ­cula.
Oh, look, I got 58 new messages.
Wow! Oh, and I got a customer.
His name is Bobby and he wants I need to get a new phone number.
Congrats on the new car, Alvarez.
Oh, thank you, Riley.
I like this last name thing.
Brings me back to my old Army days.
You know, sometimes I'll get in early and hang out with the mechanics just 'cause I miss the swearin' so much.
I have kids.
So I totally fudgin' get that.
But seriously, though, I feel like I got a really good deal.
Uh, you are a tough negotiator.
In all fairness, you got a pretty great trade-in, girl.
I can't believe I gave you 40 bucks for that thing.
Hey, it's got a full tank of gas.
The fuel gauge is broken, so you're gonna have to trust me on that.
Now, just clear out all your personal effects and we'll get you squared away.
Mrs.
Resnick.
I'm gonna miss you, old lady.
Ah! Â¡Ay, carajo! Toni Everything all right? I can't get rid of this car.
I can see why.
Talk to me, Alvarez.
This was Victor's car.
My soon to be ex.
Oh.
Got a lot of memories in here.
We drove off on our honeymoon in this old lady.
My son was probably conceived in the front seat or the back seat or both.
Well, let's just say it was the back.
He was an infantry man.
He was a good one, too.
In fact my husband was a really good man.
He was so charming.
And we were happy.
You know, like one of those couples that other couples hate being around, 'cause it shows them how not happy they are? We were that couple.
I hate that couple.
He got sent on some difficult deployments, he saw some really tough stuff.
He used to make people laugh.
And after that, I can't even remember seeing him smile.
He started sleeping late, then drinking He wouldn't get any help.
Then things got really bad.
And it wasn't safe in the house.
Until, finally, one night, I had to take those keys away from him 'cause he told me he was gonna wrap himself around a tree.
Mmm.
That's tough.
And I get it.
I went through some stuff, too, when I got back.
I'm sorry to bring it up.
No, I can talk about it now, because I did get help.
I'm in this women's veterans group.
Lot of swearin'.
You'll love it.
The hard truth is if your husband's not trying to change, there's nothing you can do.
Trust me on that.
Leaving was the right thing to do.
It's just hard to say goodbye.
I think it's time, Alvarez.
'Cause Mrs.
Resnick kind of smells like a gas leak in Hawaii.
Oh, man! I haven't talked to another soldier in a long time.
- This was really nice.
- Yeah.
- You should come to the group.
- Maybe I will.
Yeah.
Wait, wait.
What's happening here? Are we becoming friends? It's happenin', Alvarez.
And you can stop milking the shoulder injury.
I already sold you the car.
No, this is a real injury.
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's okay.
I'll tell you about it in the group.
It'd be nice to talk to a bunch of lady soldiers.
- It's hard to find women who get me.
- Oh, me, too.
What is wrong with civilian women? I know, right? It's like "Let's get mani-pedis.
" But I think we should totally get mani-pedis.
Mmm-hmm.
I could use a fill-in like nobody's business.
Is this great or is this great? Look at us all together as a family.
It's just like growing up in Cuba.
Â¡Salud! I haven't even shown you guys the best part.
Play my jam.
- No! - What? Un-break my heart Say you'll love me again Undo this hurt that you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life Come on! - Un-cry these tears - Baby, baby, baby I cried so many nights Un-break my heart
 [theme song playing] [hold music playing over phone] Oh! Oh.
Abuelita, give me back my yearbook! Your quinces is around the corner, and we need to pick a boy to be your escort.
There's no one in here.
I just Then use your phone and Chapsmat somebody.
You don't understand social media.
Abuelita No, no, no.
Of course I do.
All you have to do is find a boy and twat at him.
[coughs softly] I hope you mean "tweet"? "Twat," "tweet.
" Same thing.
Not the same thing, Mami.
Can you guys go fight somewhere else? I'm on hold with the VA.
Okay, but Elena has to pick an escort by today! Or we will not have enough time to prepare.
But I wanna go to the street fair and my quinces is two months away! [mockingly] Jajaja.
QuÃ© funny! We still have to pick the other 14 members of the court.
We have to choreograph the dances.
We have to pick the weakest dancers and put them in the back and put a curtain in front of them.
Elena, pick by the end of the day, or your escort will be Cousin Orencio.
Cousin Orencio smells like a Dorito that died in a pool of Axe body spray.
[mutters] [scoffs] Good luck getting him out of TÃ­a Mimi's basement.
I'll get him out of TÃ­a Mimi's basement.
Hey, no, don't touch that phone! Â¡Ay! [inhales sharply] Ay, ay, Elena.
[sighs] Just take the yearbook and pick somebody.
[sighs] Fine! This should be fun! Pick whoever you want.
As long as he is a dancer, and he is Cuban, and he is handsome, and I'm coming in.
[sighs] - [music stops] - Hello? [music resumes] Ah! That's cold, VA.
Ice cold.
[knocking at door] Alvarez, let's go! There's a street fair downstairs.
Beer, food this! [electronic sword clanking] Did you buy that? I won it after spending 40 bucks at the ring toss.
Wait, are you still on hold with the VA? No! I got right through.
[both laughing] Wait, can I leave this up here for safekeeping? - Who's gonna steal that? - Schneider.
Hide it in my mom's room.
Anyway, I can't go.
Today's the day I finally get through to Jolene.
[sighs deeply] She's my white whale.
My Bigfoot.
My meal cooked by my mother using no pork products of any kind.
[laughs] Hey, I served.
I get it.
But I try to never deal with the VA.
I stopped calling them about my punctured eardrum.
That seems like a bad plan.
Oh, thanks.
I got it on sale.
[Penelope shouts] I'll see you down Yeah, she can't hear me.
[woman on telephone] Pain Management Department.
Last name and last four digits of your social Alvarez, 2294 [groans] Are you are you Are you are you there? Say something.
- Please hold.
- Not that! - Hi.
- Hey, Ms.
Alvarez.
Hey, guys.
How was baseball? Terrible! I mean, they played great.
But my snack game was way off! The kids barely touched my black olive tapenade.
Thanks for helping out, but maybe next time pick a food a kid would wanna eat or has heard of.
Yeah, and maybe next time, don't hand out masks with my face on them.
Handsome, but creepy.
[groans] [exaggerated whimpering] - Ah - What, Mami? Your daughter is so dramatic.
No puedo mÃ¡s.
Mami, don't worry, she will pick someone.
- [inhales sharply] Â¡Ay! - You okay, Mom? Yeah.
I just need to talk to Jolene and get my shoulder squared away.
Here, take one of your pain pills.
I thought you don't want me to take "las drogas"? The pain in your body is real.
The pain in your mind is in your head.
[sighs] - What happened, Ms.
Alvarez? - It's nothing, Finn.
Hey, don't be so modest.
She jacked her shoulder up in Afghanistan, being a hero.
[scoffs] "Hero.
" Kabul, 2004.
I was assisting in surgery when a mortar hit close to the OR.
The blast caused a pallet of surgical gloves to fall on my shoulder.
The last part is not as impressive.
But still, it is a war wound.
Well I thank you for your service, Ms.
Alvarez.
Yeah, don't do that.
So can we have some money for the fair? Sure.
Grab ten bucks from my purse.
[Alex clicks tongue] [groans] [groans loudly] - [sighs] - What, papito? Well, it's just we need at least 20 to do anything fun.
But it's okay.
We can watch the other kids have a good time.
That sounds great.
You don't even need the ten dollars.
Okay, I get it.
I'll take the ten.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Guys, don't go anywhere.
I have kind of an exciting announcement.
Something went terribly wrong in your adult diaper? It's athleisure wear.
But the good news is, after months of planning, the members of my college band have finally put aside our differences and we're reuniting to play at the fair this afternoon.
All right.
Maybe this will entice you.
Nope.
Well, it should, because my band, Full Sail, plays yacht rock.
Â¿QuÃ© es el yacht rock? - Mami, don't ask - Yacht rock is like easy listening music, but even easier to listen to.
It's cool, but not too cool.
Soulful, but not too soulful.
I'm excited, but not too excited.
And they paid you for this? Oh, no, I had to grease a few palms to make it happen.
So you're paying them? I don't want to get into the economics of it.
But this gig is really important to me.
These guys were like family.
I used to show up at their dorm rooms unannounced and just hang out for hours and hours and hours.
I can't imagine what that would feel like.
- [woman on telephone] Hello? - [stammers] Guys Yeah, I'm here.
Did you find Jolene? - Just one more question, ma'am.
- Sure.
Anything.
Was that "Phillips" with a "P," or "Fillips" with an "F"? [softly] What? Alvarez! With an "A"! Hold, please.
[dial tone humming] Wait, wait.
Hello? Hello? [whimpering] Hello? No! Come on.
[muffled screaming] [hold music playing] Aw! [music stops] [woman on recording] Did you know that over 40% of trips to the emergency room are caused by preventable accidents? That seems high.
- [Schneider groans] - What happened? It was a totally preventable accident! [groans] We were setting up for the show and our keytarist threw a decorative anchor at me.
Okay, I'm sorry you're hurt, but it sounds like I just missed the best part of your show.
This is why Full Sail broke up in the first place.
Too many passionate personalities.
I wanted to open with Toto.
Skip wanted to open with Steely Dan.
Oh, you can't open with the Dan.
They're dangerously smooth.
What are you doing here, Doc? Why aren't you at work? What? Who, me? Well you know, I always love a good street fair.
And and since you took a half day off of work, I thought maybe I should, too.
YOLO! It stands for, "You Only Live Once.
" But why didn't you tell me you were gonna be here when I saw you earlier? What's with all the questions? Is this Castro's Cuba or America? You you know I could take a look at that eye for you myself, but there was a lot of second-hand doobie smoke at that fair and, uh I worry that I may have a bit of a contact high.
Here.
Let me see.
Is that glitter? It's called stage sparkle.
Can you please just get it out? If I had a magnifying glass, I could probably get it out.
Oh, I have one in my costume trunk.
Halloween box.
Tool kit.
Man's tool kit.
Okay, whatever.
Come on, let's just go.
Quick.
Come on.
Mami, I'm still on hold, so if they pick up, remember Alvarez, 2294.
[hold music playing] [music stops] [woman on recording] Remember to self-screen for testicular cancer.
Good advice.
My husband always asked me to check for him.
Daily.
So, um Thanks for inviting me to the fair.
You don't think Penelope suspects that we went together? Or am I just paranoid from all that grass? I don't want her to think that we were on a date or something.
[laughs] No, she wouldn't think that.
[chuckles] It'd be ridiculous.
Well, ridiculous is a little strong, but Lydia you were so wonderful to me at my birthday party.
And I would just be very happy if we could continue whatever this is.
[chuckles] [romantic music playing over phone] Can I make you a cafÃ© cubano? SÃ­, por favor.
Rosetta Stone.
- [device beeping] - Oh, espere.
It's time to take my pills.
Actually, I'm glad you reminded me.
So here is to Vitamin D.
- Vitamin D.
- [laughs] And, uh, estrogen replacement to keep me young.
For my cholesterol so I don't die.
What's going on here? Nothing! We're just taking drugs.
So, uh, how is Schneider doing? Hey, guys, I'm heading down.
This yacht rock band is about to be boarded by a pirate.
The sexy kind.
Not the kind that steals music.
Although you can record the show for free.
Just look for the big crowd.
That's the kebab truck.
We're next to that.
We're going too.
Elena? When I get back, I'm going to call Cousin Orencio.
[Elena screams] Sometimes you have to poke the bear.
[woman] Pain Management Department.
Can I help you? - Alvarez, 2294.
- Who are you holding for? - Jolene.
I'm holding for Jolene.
- Transferring you now.
- [gasps] - [line ringing] Oh, my God.
It's finally happening.
- Okay.
- [line continues ringing] Come on.
Pick up, Jolene.
Pick up.
Maybe you're peeing.
That's okay.
I have to pee, but I'm gonna hold it.
Maybe you're grabbing your four o'clock snack away from your desk.
I'm not here to judge.
You do you at the vending machine, boo-boo.
Answer the damn phone, Jolene! [man] Hello? Wait.
Who is this? Please be a man named Jolene.
No, this is Tad.
But this is Jolene's extension, right? No, I think they accidentally transferred you to an empty office.
[scoffing] Well, it's not empty now, 'cause I'm standing here talking to you.
But after I hang up and leave, it'll be empty again.
I just want an appointment with a chiropractor.
I'm Alvarez, 2294.
Can you help me, Tad? Slow down.
Let me see what we have here.
[mutters] Alvarez, 2294.
- Oh.
- Oh? What's "oh"? Don't "oh" me, Tad.
Sorry, but you need a referral from your primary care physician.
[stammers] I have one.
I sent a copy of it to Jolene's office, like, two months ago.
You should probably talk to Jolene, then.
What? I know, Tad! So, now what? Sorry.
Can you fax a new one over? Fax it? You mean, e-mail it? [Tad laughing] Okay So you want me to get in a time machine and go back to when they used fax machines to send you something that I know for a fact you already have? Well, if I had a time machine, I don't think I'd go back in time - and fax things.
- Oh, my God.
I'd buy a lotto ticket.
Okay, you know what? Focus, Tad! Okay.
I think the market down the street has a fax machine next to the off-brand candy bars.
After the day I've had, I deserve a Slickers.
Â¡Elena, ven acÃ¡! - Tad, give me five minutes.
- Okay.
I need you to watch the phone while I run out.
Remember Alvarez, 2294.
I know.
If Tad picks up, keep him on the line.
Did you take down a bag and a half of Cheetos? Step off, girl.
Hello? Abuelita? Elena? Alex, no one's home.
Your mom just left.
Just grab some pills and let's get out of here.
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe we should just hang out and play video games? [scoffs] Come on, your mom won't even notice.
I heard Shane Lennon sold one of his dad's pills for 20 bucks.
Or I could just take you off the group chat with all of our friends.
The only thing worse than being in a group chat is not being in a group chat.
[sighs] Fine, I'll do it.
Great.
I'll stand guard and if I see somebody coming, I'll yell "Tumbleweed.
" That's our code word.
Why is that the code word? I don't know.
Shut up.
No, you shut up.
- [exhales heavily] - [pills rattle] [door opens] [hold music playing] [woman on recording] Having trouble communicating with your family members? [scoffs] You could say that.
Feeling like no one understands you? Yep.
Losing your appetite due to depression or anxiety? Obviously not.
[sighs] Do you have advice for feeling like the weirdo in your family? For explaining that you don't want to pick a boy to be the escort to your quinces, 'cause [scoffs] you don't even know if you like boys.
- Reach out and talk to someone.
- [Elena scoffs] Yeah.
That'll go great.
How do I even do that? "Hey, Mom, I think I might like girls.
" - [electronic sword clanking] - [Alex] Damn it! What are you doing here? Why are you spying on me? Tumbleweed.
I'm not even gonna ask about the sword.
What are you doing with Mom's pills? - I can explain.
- Mmm-hmm.
I was stealing them.
Mom is going to kill you.
I mean, quite literally, she is going to kill you.
Resuscitate you, kill you again, and then ground your lifeless body.
I didn't really want to.
It was Finn's idea.
Please don't tell Mom.
I won't, but what's Finn's problem anyway? You're gonna let him turn you into a little Latino drug dealer? Stereotype much? It's not drug dealing.
God.
We were just going to sell pills to get some money.
Oh.
[sighs] [sighs] So did you hear what I was saying while you were back there? Nah, that curtain is pretty thick.
You can't say anything to anyone.
It's not that I'm embarrassed.
I'm just not sure.
I promise.
I won't say anything.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's not like you'd be in trouble.
I mean, who cares, right? Good brother.
Now I really don't understand what's going on.
[woman on phone] Hello? [both shouting] Alvarez! 2294! Who are you holding for? I don't know, but please don't hang up! We gotta keep her talking.
- Is this Penelope Alvarez? - Yes! I'm Penelope.
I'm a badass, who served in Afghanistan doing army stuff! Hooah! And I'm her son, Alex.
I know my mom sounds young, but these days, babies having babies I'm back! Thank God.
I was running out of material.
What happened to you? I got roughed up pushing through the crowd on the way to the market.
That kebab line is no joke.
- [woman on phone] Hello? - Hello, hello? Who is this? This is Jolene in Pain Management.
Oh, Jolene! Oh, my God, Jolene.
Hey, let's go.
It's time for the smooth, summer sounds of Full Sail.
Schneider made me say that.
Wait! Let me warm up my voice before the show.
Boo Yep, I'm good.
What happened to Tad? Would you like me to transfer you to Tad? One moment.
No, no, no! No! I want you, Jolene.
Can I help you? Yes, ma'am.
Oh! I'm so excited.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to fangirl out, but you are Jolene.
Yes, I am.
Whoo! It has been a trip getting to you, mama.
Okay, so I just want to make an appointment with the chiropractor.
- So if you have anything for next week.
.
- I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to call back on Monday.
- Why can't you help me now? - I have to go.
Okay.
I I don't mean to be difficult.
Still a huge fan.
But isn't the VA open until 5:00? It is, but if I don't catch the 4:30 bus, I have to take the 4:45.
So I've been trying to get in contact with you for a month.
You can't take five minutes to help me out? Well, you don't understand.
I have to leave.
Well, then, walk me through it, Jolene.
Because I don't understand.
What I do understand is I went to war, I got hurt.
And when I came back, there was supposed be an organization set up to help me and other veterans get the help we need.
So I don't get why it's so hard to make a simple appointment.
And I'm one of the lucky ones.
My husband has bad knees, a bad back and traumatic brain injury.
He's not getting help.
Partly because he's a stubborn ass, but mostly because of this insane process.
And because he's not getting help, he almost did something stupid.
I lost someone in my unit because she did do something stupid.
So, please, enlighten me, Jolene, as to why helping soldiers is less important than you catching your goddamn bus.
- Hold, please.
- [scoffs] - [hold music playing] - [sighing] [music stops] [Jolene] I have set a chiropractor appointment for Alvarez, Penelope, 2294, next Monday at 11:00 a.
m.
with Dr.
Pearl.
Will that work for you, ma'am? Yes, that would be great.
- Thank you so mu - [line disconnects] [laughs] Classic Jolene.
[sighs] Yeah! [gasps] Â¡Ay! Okay.
[whispers] That was a bit too much.
[sighs deeply] Ah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - [panting] - [band playing outside] Yeah.
All right.
[Schneider over PA] Ahoy, Echo Parrrk! We be Full Sail! [Elena] Boo! [Schneider] Come on, Elena! [Schneider singing out of tune] It's not in the way that you hold me It's not in the way you say you care It's not in the way you look Or the things that you say that you do Hold the line Oh! Love isn't always on time [music continues playing]
Oh, someone looks nice.
Oh, gracias.
I learned to do the contouring on the YouTube.
Oh! She looks nice, too.
Interesting.
Very interesting.
Should I be interested? Because I'm not.
What are you guys talking about? Lupita, it is Friday at 7:00 p.
m.
Usually by now, your sweatpants are on and your bra is off.
You have a date.
It's a date! What? Can't I just shower, put on lipstick and nice clothes just for myself? Yeah, I'm not even buying it.
Yes, why not be honest? Mira, for ejemplo, I am going to church tonight to feed the poor.
There, I said it.
Okay, fine.
It's a date.
Just a casual drink, not a big deal.
I met him through a friend.
He will never replace your papi.
No, he's not Cuban.
Your date no longer interests me.
Anyway, I gotta go soon, but I forgot Abuelita and I are both doing something.
- Alex, what're you doing tonight? - Chilling at Finn's house.
Didn't you just say this morning that you had so much homework to do this weekend? Finn has this genius idea to fill up a shopping cart with candy and ask girls if they wanna hop in our sweet ride.
Okay, so you're gonna stay home.
And Elena will watch you.
Oh.
So you automatically assume I don't have any plans? - You have plans? - I could.
Ay, quÃ© bueno.
Finally, you are going to pick a boy to be your quinces escort.
Abuelita, I already asked someone and I should know by the end of the day.
He's in my English class.
We're just friends.
And no, he's not Cuban.
Why do you two love to hurt me? - Anyway, have a good date, Mom.
- Bye.
And don't try to hide stuff from us.
What can I say? I'm a terrible liar.
I am an amazing liar.
And you'd rather let them think all that date stuff, instead of just telling them you're goin' to therapy? Oh, yeah! If they had guessed I was a serial killer, I would have gone with that, too.
I am so sorry I'm late, you guys.
I was at the movies.
Another remake.
Well, I mean, it was nothing like the original.
But I like 'em both.
Anyway, Lolly brought up a really great point last week.
There's a lot of anxiety and depression that we face as veterans that can lead to isolation, right? Because our civilian friends and family members, they can't relate.
Oh, for sure.
I mean, I'm a gay female minority, so anxiety and depression are my two best friends.
And isolation is my boo.
And there's definitely some combat stuff that's tough to shake.
In Iraq, if your Hummer gets stuck in traffic, it means you're a sitting duck.
In LA, it means you're in LA! But my brain doesn't know that, so I'm just constantly sweating in the car.
So, whatever.
On hot days, I just take my top off.
Which has caused some traffic jams 'cause you know.
Well, thank you for sharing, Ramona.
We hear you.
Come on, girl.
Get in there.
Oh.
Hey, hi.
Hi.
This kind of attention makes me sweat.
Like her in traffic.
So, it's like swoosh! Hello.
I'm sorry.
I'm fighting my nature on all of this.
I'm Cuban! You know, we don't really do therapy.
I feel you.
In my family, the only therapist we're allowed to talk to is Jesus.
And he must be booked up because he has not returned my calls.
Oh, my This is why I couldn't tell my mom I was coming here.
She already hates that I'm on antidepressants.
You know, to her, therapy is for the locos.
Even my cousin Consuelo, who wears her underpants on the outside She doesn't do therapy.
No! No, no.
She's just "funny.
" Anyway, it's totally fine if you don't feel And try being the only person in the history of your family that's getting a divorce.
Anybody here divorced? Oh, it's about to get shared.
Okay, queridos, your abuelita is going to church! Vete con Dios, Abuelita.
Shh! I'm watching Buffy! I love you, papito.
Bye, Elena.
Hi! Leslie, I told you to text me when you were outside.
I did, but you didn't respond.
I don't know how to use those things.
I don't know how to use them either.
We have so much in common.
Lydia can I ask you something? I am 73.
I know, I look 32.
Agreed.
But why do we have to keep it a secret that we're going to the opera together? Because I don't want my family to think that something is going on.
They are so crazy.
They would probably think we're out on a date.
We we have different senses of humor.
Oh, mira, we're just two people on a lovely outing as companions.
A companions' outing.
How platonic.
Well, thank you so much for joining me.
I always get two tickets to stuff in hopes that someone will go.
But, Lydia, you look beautiful.
Uh, just careful with those shoes.
Oh, please.
I came out of the womb wearing stilettos.
Even my footie pajamas had kitten heels.
- Oh! - Oh! Lydia! Are you okay? Oh, my shoe My favorite shoe.
Taken in the prime of its life.
But how about your foot? I'm fine.
What's so great about Buffy? It's just a vampire show.
Well, it's an allegory for how strong women are in constant battle with an oppressive, bloodsucking, male-dominated society.
Whoa! Buffy's hot.
I know, right? - Oh, no.
- What? It's a text from the guy I asked to be my quinces escort.
He said yes.
This is a disaster! Yeah, for him.
No, for me.
My whole plan to get Abuelita off my back was to ask a popular guy who would never do it.
He rejects me, I full-on fake cry, Abuelita feels guilty, and boom I escape the patriarchal tradition of having to be escorted to my quinces, and instead grow out my unibrow and read a poem about Frida Kahlo.
Do I have to come to your quinces? - Who's the guy? - Josh Flores.
Josh Flores? He's like the star of the baseball team.
He should be dating a hot girl who got held back a grade, not you.
Oh, and now he says I'm cute? What? So are you gonna tell Josh that you're not into boys? You know, that way.
Well, all I said is I might be into girls.
But I probably like boys, too.
I don't know.
Huh? It's like I've never tried broccoli.
So I can't say for sure that I don't like broccoli.
We had broccoli last night for dinner.
It's a metaphor, Alex.
Broccoli means boys.
Oh, I see but it's not like you tried girls before either.
Sorry, I mean I guess, cauliflower? That's because cauliflower is a lot harder to find.
I mean, how many girls do you know that like cauliflower? None.
Although, Finn is pretty sure Denise Falto does because she didn't want his Skittles.
Skittles just means Skittles.
Well, let's just say I'm open to trying broccoli.
I mean, I'm not gonna go out and buy broccoli, but if broccoli falls on my plate Stop.
I don't wanna know what your plate is.
What're you doing? I told Josh to come over.
What? Josh Flores is coming over? But I haven't showered.
What to wear, what to wear Yup, you are not gonna be here.
You, sir, are going to Schneider's.
Ooh, you're gonna have a boy over here alone? Yeah, you know, maybe it'll be great, maybe it'll be terrible.
- But either way, you won't be here.
- Okay! But at least mention me to Josh.
Tell him I'm awesome.
No, no, too strong.
Tell him I'm rad.
So, I've been a civilian for ten years and I still get anxious when I'm shopping for clothes.
I feel that.
Ramona, you're an amazing hype woman.
You're coming with me everywhere.
You do you, girl.
Seriously, I love that so much! Yeah! Anyway, there's too many choices, right? I mean, it used to be one uniform, which we all crushed, because we were in the best shape of our lives.
But then we get out, and it's like, why did we do all those side straddle hops when there's Spanx? Anyway, Pam, pick someone else.
I don't really feel like talking today.
Uh, our session ended 15 minutes ago.
Thank you all for coming.
Oh, it's okay, Alvarez, the rest of us will talk next week.
It just feels so good to let it all out with you ladies.
You're just You're all so strong and you're so beautiful.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you, Penelope.
Release those tears, mama! Seriously, never stop.
Ay, Leslie, this is not necessary.
I fell.
I have a bruise that I will cure with the power of my mind.
In the car you told me you were dizzy.
I just wanna make sure you're okay because I care about you.
Okay.
You may proceed.
Great.
Let me just start with a few questions.
Uh, any allergies? Allergies are not a real thing.
All right.
Uh, any history of serious illness? Never.
But if ever I get one, my Cuban blood will eat it and absorb it into nothing.
There's not a checkbox for that.
Any hospital visits? No.
Oh! Oh, a long time ago, I had a stroke, but it was nothing.
Lydia, a stroke is not nothing.
I made a 100% recovery.
And I have full movement in both my arms.
I can mime in a box.
Can you? No, I can't.
Did you do anything different today than usual? What did you eat? Oh, I cooked a beautiful tortilla espaÃ±ola, and bistec empanizado and dinosaur nuggets.
Papito's comfort food.
And which of those did you eat? None.
Well, I I was cooking.
I had no time.
Oh That's why you're dizzy.
Lydia, you need to eat.
You would make a good Cuban mother.
Please.
Cubans got nothing on the Jews when it comes to force-feeding their children! Now, Lydia, if you don't mind, I would like to take a look at that foot.
Oh, okay, but no hanky-panky.
My body belongs to God and my husband's ghost.
Lydia, this is a professional environment.
Mmm-hmm.
Ah, uh I said no hanky-panky.
This is just some after-hours energy-saving thing.
See? All right Oh, no.
Well, this is a problem.
What? What is it? You have a hammertoe that has to be shaved down.
I do? What does it mean? Leslie, be honest.
Will I ever dance again? This is a simple out-patient procedure.
We'll have you back on your dancing feet in no time.
Oh, no, leave it.
Leave it.
Now that I have the foot of a monster, I want to hide in the shadows until it is fixed.
So, things are going good on my date.
I think we're gonna grab a coffee.
Everything okay over there? Yeah, Alex is doing homework, and I'm just sitting here by myself, you know, watching Buffy.
Okay, bye, Mom.
So this isn't like some bad teen movie where the popular guy pranks the nerd girl, and you make me feel special and next thing I know, I'm covered in pig's blood? Uh no.
It's not a prank.
For real, Elena, I've had a crush on you all year.
All year? Really? I mean, there was a week when I was home sick and puking, but you were still in there.
Aw Did you say you were watching Buffy? - Yeah, you know it? - Yeah, I love it.
First three seasons, solid.
Right? Mmm.
Where do you stand on season six? Dark Buffy.
I know, right? But I do feel like there were some solid stand-alones, like The musical.
You know you look not that bad.
I mean you got good lips.
You got nice eyes, blue.
Your smile is slightly uneven, but it's offset by a strong jaw.
I think you're super hot, too.
Wait, do I like you? Do you always say your thoughts out loud? Because I kinda like it.
- I wanna kiss you now.
- I really like it.
That wasn't horrible.
That was not what I was hoping to hear, but I can do better.
Hey, Schneider, can I use your laptop? Yeah, sure thing, man.
What, do you need to research something? Maybe I can help.
I'm trying to get information on lesbians.
Oh, wow.
I just typed in L-E-S and it filled in "bians" and then a lot of other stuff.
Ah Yeah, let's shut that for now.
Um, why do you need info on lesbians? Don't get me wrong.
I understand the curiosity, but I'm not sure you should be doing that.
I'm just trying to find out if they also like guys.
You have stumbled onto a real eternal question, buddy.
But probably not something I should talk to you about without your mom's permission.
And just thinking ahead, I don't think she's gonna give permission.
What, are you worried about something? I'm just confused because Elena said she might like this dude, Josh.
So? So nothing.
Wait a minute.
Alex, are you saying Elena might be gay? Uh no.
Because it's a secret.
Whoa.
She just said she might like girls, but she might like boys, too.
Don't worry.
We already had the broccoli-cauliflower conversation.
That's smart.
But what did your mom say? She doesn't know.
Nobody knows.
You can't say anything.
Elena will kill me.
Okay, don't worry.
I won't.
Even though I have so many questions, like When did she know? And what is the broccoli-cauliflower conversation? It's just all so confusing.
I mean, Josh is down there with her right now.
Wait a minute.
Elena's downstairs alone? With a boy? Not just any boy.
He's the super-cool captain of the baseball team.
Oh, that's even worse! He's probably rounding the bases as we speak.
Somebody should do something.
Oh, wait, it's me! I should do something.
Okay.
No, no, no, no.
No.
Um I like you, so I just don't want to mess this up.
Do you think we should talk more or something? - Um - No, I'm good.
You are so awesome.
Okay.
Hands off her! I am the go-to male authority figure here.
And I am shutting this unauthorized party down.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry, sir.
You were right.
He is super cool.
Alex, you told Schneider? Oh, hey, Josh.
Alex Alvarez.
Sorry, I'm a mess.
I woke up with flat hair.
You know how it is.
'Sup? Okay, Elena, I'm sorry.
But, dude, I don't think you're supposed to be here without a parent around.
I totally get it.
I'll go.
I'll text you later.
Right.
Alex, I can't believe you told on me! And I am certainly glad he did, young lady! That sounds scary.
I am nailing this! It just slipped out.
It's true, Elena.
Alex didn't mean to tell me.
He was just confused 'cause you were suddenly into a boy.
Why would that be confusing? Uh Now I'm confused.
- You told him everything? - Don't worry, Elena.
I'm not gonna say anything.
It's your business.
Yes, it is.
The only reason I'm here is because Alex said your mom wasn't home and there was a boy over here and I just There was a boy over here? Abuelita, what are you doing home so early? - And why are you limping? - Because she fell.
In church.
In church.
That's where we ran into each other.
I love church.
Lydia, you should probably get something for your stomach.
I'll go grab you some juice.
Schneider tell me everything.
Of course.
This super-cool dude, Josh, was over while Alex was upstairs with me.
But not to worry, 'cause I came down to check and everything was fine.
The end.
I understand.
My granddaughter is a sex fiend.
Wait.
Who's a sex fiend? Elena.
She was here alone with a boy.
- What? - No.
Nothing bad happened, Abuelita.
- Mom - Okay, you're in big trouble, 'cause that means when I called you, you lied to Wait, Doc? What are you doing here? I came over to your house to bring your mom some juice.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Worth the trip.
Abuelita, I thought you ran into him at church.
You were at a Catholic mass, Dr.
Berkowitz? What can I say? I hedge my bets.
You're both dressed up.
Wait.
Were you two on a date? It was a platonic companions' outing.
- What the hell does that mean? - I don't know! How dare you insinuate that I was lying to you! You were lying to me! A weird lie, but it's still a lie! How was your date, Mom? Hey, Alvarez, you left your phone in my car.
Whoa! This is your date? So much to process today.
So much.
Oh, honey, no, no, no.
Your mom and I weren't on a date.
I mean, she should be so lucky.
We were just at therapy.
Um Therapy's the name of a hot new club.
Fixed it.
Bye, girl.
You were in therapy? No, I was on a date with a woman.
Mentira! Therapy is for the locos.
I told you that you would lose your mind taking those antiperspirants.
And how dare you keep a secret from me? Lydia, take it easy.
You have a history of stroke.
You had a stroke? I kept it a secret from you.
You kept it a secret from me? It was nothing.
You were pregnant with Elena.
I didn't want to bother you.
This was 15 years ago! I can't believe you! I have a hammertoe that needs to be shaved.
How dare you attack me when I'm about to go under the knife? This is obviously a very personal family matter.
Yeah, you should go.
Both of you.
What? I thought we were doing a thing Okay.
Elena I can't believe you lied.
Well, you went to therapy and said it was a date.
I can't believe you lied.
I am the mom! I'm allowed to lie! And I am the mom's mom and I get to lie even more! No She is the one who is going boy crazy with this cabrÃ³n, Josh.
Josh agreed to be my quinces escort.
A wonderful boy.
He is.
I'm sorry I had him here when no one was home.
And I'm sorry I lied about it.
It was stupid.
Apology accepted, but you're still grounded.
And you When you have a stroke and don't die, you tell people.
First thing Monday, I'm taking you to get a full physical.
And not by Dr.
Berkowitz 'cause now you've made that weird.
Okay, perdÃ³name for not telling you about the stroke.
And I'm sorry that I lied about therapy.
But I hope you can understand why.
Because it's shameful.
Not even your cousin Consuelo goes to therapy.
She fights the crazy like a strong woman should.
Okay.
So this is why I lied.
Oh, Mami, look It was it was really great.
It was a bunch of women that I related to sharing our feelings and our experiences.
And it made me really happy.
Ay, okay.
Relax.
Who said anything? Ay.
Okay.
So no more secrets.
Is there anything else anybody wants to tell me? Speak now.
All right.
Let me talk to her.
Alex, help Abuelita.
So Josh? What do you wanna know? Nothing happened? - Mom! - Come on.
I'm You've never shown an interest in a boy before.
And it's exciting.
It's terrifying.
But it's mostly exciting.
We kissed.
But that's it.
And how was it? It was okay.
Okay? All right.
I get it.
My first kiss was weird, because I had braces.
And the guy said he could taste the plÃ¡tano stuck in my rubber bands.
But lucky for me, he was Cuban.
He didn't mind.
You should've married him! Oh, my God.
So Do you like Josh? Yeah.
I mean, he likes Buffy and he has nice eyes.
But if I'm being honest, I think Alex is more into him than me.
Seriously, guys.
How good do I look in this?
[Lydia humming] Abuelita, how are you so happy in the morning? Oh, it's easy, Mamita.
Every night I dream of your abuelo, and we are playing dominoes and I win.
[chuckles] - Over and over and - Okay, I got it! [knocking on door] Hey, guys, you're in luck.
I finally found a vintage store that had a chair that matches your dining set.
Why do we need an extra chair? It's not really extra.
There's five of us.
[all gasp] I know.
It's not a perfect match.
But it's hardly the sorest thumb in the room.
Not the chair! What the hell are you wearing? Oh.
Che Guevara? Yeah.
Viva la revoluciÃ³n, am I right? You are wrong.
- Do you have any idea - I got this.
Do you have any idea Kids, relax.
[yells] Do you have any idea what this comemierda did? Grew an awesome beard and modeled for T-shirts? First of all, he wasn't even Cuban! He was Castro's right-hand man.
He burned books.
He banned music.
He personally oversaw execution squads.
He was a mass murderer! But [sighs] He has a cool hat.
It's like if you walked into a Jewish home wearing a Hitler shirt.
Or into Taylor Swift's home wearing a Kanye shirt.
Oh, my God! You guys.
I am so sorry.
- I had no idea.
[pants] - Okay.
We forgive you, Schneider.
We know that sometimes you are a bobo and don't know what you're doing.
It's okay.
Okay, now I kind of miss the shirt.
[theme song playing in Spanish] Hey, everybody.
Oh, finally you're home.
I have great news.
That reminds me! Papito has great news! I do.
In school, we have our nation project and today we picked our countries.
We chose alphabetically by last name.
Finally, makes me proud to be an Alvarez.
So, not the brave military mom wounded in the line of duty? Okay.
Let me guess.
You went for the easy A and picked America? No.
Stupid Travis Aarons got America.
I chose Cuba.
No, papito.
Cuba chose you.
It'll be nice for you to do some research on where we're from.
Yeah, I'm probably just going to film abuelita blabbing for a while.
You know her, "Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.
Ay.
Â¡AzÃºcar!" You have captured my essence.
I won't even have to write a paper.
It's like no work.
[sighs] Be less excited about that part.
Put some effort in.
Hey, why are you so hard on him? [chuckles] Are you kidding me? What happened to, "An A is an A, but a B is an F, and a C stands for China, because that's where you're going to live now.
" Okay, that's true.
But papito has such a pretty face to fall back on.
Worst-case scenario, I'll just marry some rich lady.
That's my boy.
[yells] Remember me? Can I finally share my news? I'm sorry, mama.
Please tell us.
Sister Fidelis told me that I'm a finalist for the Voices of Tomorrow.
[Penelope and Lydia gasping] The singing show? [gasping] Nietecita, I could not be more proud.
It's a writing program.
Oh.
Kookie, that's great.
It's a really big deal.
Only 30 students get chosen out of the whole country.
[whooping] But wait How much does it cost? All expenses paid.
[whooping] That's what I'm talking about! I mean, they say it's an Ivy League stepping stone.
Not that I buy into the aristocracy of the Ivy League, but it will be rewarding to turn Harvard down.
You get into Harvard, you're going.
Columbia even better, 'cause it will be easy for Abuelita to pronounce.
[mouthing] Columbia.
So, if they pick you what do we get to put in the Alvarez Museum? Come on! A trophy? A medal? A ribbon? And don't say the value of a job well done.
We need hardware! - I don't think I get anything.
- There's got to be something.
I need a visual record of how hard you guys are killing it.
Because that means you're killing it.
Because that means I'm killing it! - But I'm not even in yet.
- [shushing] We're going to have to make some space.
Can we take down the shadow box with our baby teeth in it? Why would we do that? Abuelita has a whole necklace planned.
Who would ever wear that necklace? Your bride, at your wedding.
[both gagging] I love that they think we're serious.
[both giggling] You're in a good mood.
- Is it because you - Stop! Think.
Is it appropriate? Never mind.
But I am in a good mood because Elena is up for a very competitive writing program.
It's pretty huge.
- She wants to be a journalist.
- Like on E! News? - No, like someone who writes the news.
- So like Us Weekly.
At least you're reading.
But I'm proud of her.
She has a dream and she's making it happen.
I remember when I had dreams.
When I was her age, I wanted to be the next Allan Sherman! The famous song parodist? "Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh"? "Shticks and Stones"? And, instead of "Hava Nagila," "Harvey and Sheila.
" I used to dream of competing in the X Games.
I had my own street luge.
You probably can't tell this by looking at me, but I was a big luger! Oh, we can tell.
A singer, a street luger and a person who could read.
What was your crazy, unrealistic dream, Penelope? I wanted to be a doctor.
Well, that's not a crazy dream.
It's just a regular, attainable dream that you didn't attain.
Oh.
[chuckles] No, it's fine.
Life went a different way.
Army, marriage, kids I guess 18-year-old me would be disappointed in my career, but she also wore brown eyeliner on her lips, so what'd that fool know? [laughing] So Yeah, I mean, I I've made sacrifices, but that just means Alex and Elena can have an even better life than I did.
Just like my parents did for me.
I know that's supposed to sound sweet, but it really bums me out.
So I had to flee Cuba and come here to America.
Your abuelo and I were separated for years before we found our way back into each other's arms.
[gasps] There was an earthquake the day we were reunited and I am convinced that the passion of our embrace moved the Earth.
[sighs] Not sure the science checks out, but who cares? That was beautiful.
[chuckles] Oh.
Gracias.
What are you doing? History is coming alive before your eyes! And that's too small a camera for too big a star! - What? - Keep talking.
You are so lucky she's here.
I know nothing about my grandparents and I never will.
And they live in Pasadena! I mean, the traffic's just [sighs] Anyway, this is a huge opportunity for you.
With the right production value, this might qualify for a Student Academy Award.
- [gasps] - Oh, yeah.
The Soscars? It's a thing.
I could win a trophy? Something for the Alvarez Museum besides my teeth? Don't forget your umbilical cord.
[chuckles] What the hell kind of museum is this? I'm gonna make a movie! I'll write a script, cast it, edit it Wait, am I making more work for myself? Am I excited about it? Is this what it's like to be Elena? I will start my beauty regime now.
I will be ready at dawn.
- Okay, but I have to go to school.
- Oh, good.
'Cause dawn was pushing it.
Okay.
So we're doing this tomorrow afternoon? Ah, I was supposed to have jury duty, but you know what? I'm just gonna call my guy.
This is more important.
Oh, hey, Pen.
Do you have a 50-foot extension cord and some dry ice? You know what? I'll make a run to the depot.
There's this great one I like to hit in Pasadena.
- Do I wanna know? - Tomorrow, I'm filming the whole family for my Cuba project.
It's a lot of extra work, but I'm really excited.
What is happening to me? Elena, something came in the mail! - [shrieking] - Ow! [Penelope] Look, here! - Is it from the Voices of Tomorrow? - Yes, it is! Looks like someone's gonna be the next Danielle Steel! - [Lydia chuckles] - What? She's a writer.
- "Dear, Ms.
Alvarez" - [both shrieking] Every year, thousands of students apply nationwide to fill 30 prestigious spots.
We are pleased to inform you [both shrieking] "of your acceptance to the Voices of Tomorrow.
" I did it! Screw you, Harvard! No, no.
She didn't mean that, Harvard! "It is our pleasure to inform you that you are this year's diversity candidate.
" Diversity candidate? Diversity candidate! "Being a diverse person" That's not even grammatically correct.
"you have a unique perspective and we value your contribution to our conversation.
" - Ugh! - What? That all sounds great.
No, they're saying I only got in 'cause I'm Cuban.
An award for being Cuban? Finally! You should take opportunities when they come.
'Cause when you're my age, you might regret having missed your chance.
I want a spot, not a diversity spot.
What happened to, "Diversity programs are part of our national responsibility", to level out a systemically uneven playing field"? - Well said.
- You said that when you were eight.
I'm sorry.
It just feels weird! It's, like, tainted.
I'll have to think about it.
Where's the letter? Penelope I need a consult, stat.
- What's that? - Lyrics.
I was so inspired by our conversation yesterday, I started writing parody songs.
Doc, there's, like, 20 patients waiting outside.
[mumbles] Just tell me which one you like better.
[snapping fingers and tapping foot rhythmically] What a ham, what a ham, what a ham What a mighty honey glazed ham Or Exercising makes us strong Zumba, Zumba Wow, this It's just so hard to pick.
- I have others - No.
Okay, the ham.
I like the ham one.
Don't do the Zumba.
Please don't do that again.
I I am really enjoying myself, you know? It's never too late to do what you love.
Okay.
So, I've been thinking.
Theoretically, if I still wanted to become a doctor Yes, yes, yes! Okay! [chuckles] Now I'm excited! Break it down.
[stutters] Tell me, what do I do? First, you take the MCAT.
Then you take it again when you fail.
Most people do.
Me, three times.
[chuckles] And then, just four years of med school.
Okay.
Five years, that's not bad! Then three years of residency.
And you never know where they're gonna send you, or what adventure awaits you.
You may get Honolulu.
I got Toledo.
Why people say, "Holy Toledo," I'll never know.
Nothing holy about it.
It's hell.
[laughs] Okay.
[chuckles] Eight years.
Oh, and then your fellowship.
Three more years.
So, 11 years? Wow.
You are going to ace the math portion of the MCAT.
And don't you worry, you will be shocked at how quickly a decade goes by.
Especially when you don't see your family.
But, in the end it will all be worth it, because you will be a doctor.
And $200,000 in debt! [chuckles] - I still haven't paid mine off! - You haven't? Looks like the sweet release of death will come first.
I win! Isn't this better? A good camera, proper lighting, and a cast in wardrobe.
I look like a fruit salad.
I look like Cousin Consuelo.
Don't let the beard throw you.
It actually looks really natural.
Lights, camera Talk now! [in exaggerated Cuban accent] I am a farmer.
I grow [grunts] coffee beans one of Cuba's most important exports.
I work every day from sunrise to sunset.
But I am happy with my simple life.
Cut! Can we do it again? It doesn't really seem like you're a farmer.
[in normal voice] 'Cause I'm not really a farmer.
It's not too late to recast.
You auditioned and didn't get the part.
Move on, man.
Okay, Elena, you're up.
Great.
But I have some notes on the script.
Oh, here we go.
I hate it when the talent has thoughts.
What are you trying to say about Cubans? You're making us out to be total stereotypes.
We're not this different from everyone else.
[scoffs softly] Elena, get over the diversity thing.
A committee of people think you're a smart Latina, and they wanna help you achieve your dreams.
How is this not a good thing? Because I only got chosen to fulfill their race quota! They probably think I dress like this, and that I came over on a raft, rolling a cigar, and yelling, [imitating Tony Montana] "Say hello to my little friend.
" - Can we please finish shooting? - Yes.
We'll talk about this later.
There's nothing left to talk about.
I already e-mailed them and told them I'm not accepting it.
You did what? What [spits] You don't get it, kiddo.
You don't get it! This is a big deal.
And you don't have the luxury to be like, "Oh, it hurts my feelings.
" Come on! When I was 15, I would've jumped at this.
You have no idea what life is going to throw at you, and right now, you have the chance to pursue your dreams.
And not everybody gets to do that.
But it's my future! I wanna do it my way.
Elena! Oh, how do you storm off in this thing? [grunts] I have never seen such un-professionalism.
This is why I don't work! It's okay.
Let's get to the star.
Abuelita, you're up.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you there.
[chuckles] It is I, Lydia Riera, the most famous dancer in Cuba.
I can do flamenco, salsa, mambo, pachanga, and the Funky Chicken.
[playing castanets] [vocalizing] Okay, abuelita.
Time for your story.
Make me laugh.
Make me cry.
Get me an A.
Well, when I was in Cuba the peoples would line up for blocks and blocks just to see me.
I was the iPhone of my time.
But then Castro took over.
My family was forced to flee.
And that's when I came to America.
Ooh! You know what would be good? Talk about being one of the Pedro Pan kids.
[gasps] Ah! Pedro Pan was a program that started during the revolution to fly children out of Cuba and give them safe haven in the United States until Castro left.
Okay so you were put on a plane to a new country where you didn't know the language? Oh, yes.
Without your parents? Yes.
And you were Elena's age, which would have made TÃ­a Maruchi my age? And Mimi would've been really young.
Yes.
Wow, Abuelita.
I can't even imagine.
That must have been so hard, taking care of your sisters, since you were the oldest.
Mami Are you okay? Ah [voice breaking] You know, I am sorry.
I'm a little tired.
I'm sorry, papito.
I think I am done talking.
Hmm? You want me to do her part? Is Alex okay? - Did I ruin his movie? - No.
Alex is fine.
He's a little confused.
Frankly, so am I.
[sighing] I know how much you like talking about all the good times in Cuba.
And I also know that there are certain things that are hard to talk about.
But I've never seen you react like that.
What's going on? It might be good for you to talk about it.
That's what I've been doing in therapy.
Okay, forget therapy.
But you came here alone, with nothing and you made an amazing life.
Someday, maybe you could talk to me about it.
I would love to hear your whole story.
I remember being at the airport.
We were only allowed one suitcase.
And my mami was so clever.
[sniffles] She sewed two dresses together, one inside the other so I could have more clothing.
Then it was time to say goodbye but I couldn't let go of Blanca.
Who's Blanca? [sighs] My sister.
Mami, you don't have a sister named Blanca.
There's Mimi, Maruchi, Mirtha.
She was my older sister.
Oh.
[sniffles] She couldn't come with us because she was 19.
Too old for Pedro Pan.
And she kept telling me "It's okay, we'll be seeing each other again in a few months.
" She said "Pucha, you have to go.
Walk through the pecera and don't look back.
"If you look back, you will never go forward.
" So I did it.
Because I did everything Blanca told me to do.
I never looked back.
[softly] Oy, Mami [sniffles] [sobbing] [sniffles] She died when you were little.
They said that she died of the flu Pero quiÃ©n sabe.
[sniffles] Every day, I wish I hadn't listened to her.
Every day [sniffling and sobbing] I wish I had looked back.
Ay, Mami.
Mami, I'm so sorry.
[both sobbing] No, no.
It's okay.
I'm glad I told you.
Leaving was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
And I am happy that I did it.
Because look what I made.
[Elena sniffles] [chuckles] So, I guess you heard everything? It's just a curtain! Abuelita I had no idea what our family's gone through.
I'm gonna take that diversity spot.
[sighs] I'm sorry I was so stubborn.
It's okay.
Just get in there and outshine everyone and they won't even remember you're Cuban.
Oh, no.
I'm going to make sure that they don't forget that I'm Cuban.
Pa'lante! Abuelita I'm sorry I made you upset.
Oh, no, no.
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.
I will tell it again.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Just let me reapply my makeup.
I didn't come all this way for you to get a B.
[Lydia on TV] But every sacrifice was worth it, so that my family could be whatever they wanted to be, and do whatever they wanted to do.
[in exaggerated Cuban accent] IncreÃ­ble! But that is only one story.
There are many rich stories from Cuba that must be told.
Oh, no.
The wind is picking up.
Un huracÃ¡n! [yelling] Un huracÃ¡n! - [Dr.
Berkowitz] Oh.
- [all applauding] Oh, Lydia, I'm so thrilled to be your date at the premiere of the greatest story ever filmed.
You exaggerate, Leslie.
[chuckles] Date.
That was great, Alex.
Thanks.
And I finally have my contribution to the Alvarez Museum.
My script with an A-plus on the cover.
[exclaiming and applauding] And don't forget your signed headshot of the producer.
That's not going on my wall.
We'll see.
Uh but I may have something to add to the wall soon.
After giving it a lot of thought I have decided to go back to school to become No, no, no! Don't become a doctor! Please, I've been regretting it ever since we talked.
I'm so sorry I inspired you.
[chuckles] Relax, Doc.
You didn't inspire me.
They did.
I'm not gonna be a doctor.
I'm gonna be a nurse practitioner.
It's all the things that excite me about being a doctor, but the training takes a fraction of the time, and it still comes with a pretty sweet salary bump.
- Wonderful.
That's - Thank you.
Hey, maybe we could both be nurse practitioners.
Nah, I couldn't.
I enjoy the white coat too much.
[laughs] NPs get a white coat.
Son of a bitch! Pobrecito Leslie.
Maybe this will cheer you up.
Leslie and Lydia Leslie and Lydia Leslie and Lydia We're just good friends [continues singing indistinctly] synced by susinz
- Hey, Pen, you busy? - Yes.
My mom is at the opera with Dr.
Berkowitz, both kids are out of the house and I am finally enjoying some time to myself.
Ooh, wine and coupons.
Been there.
Just substitute wine with whiskey, and coupons with more whiskey.
- Did you want something? - Just to share some amazing news.
I am unplugged.
Yeah.
No more Internet, no social media, not even a phone.
Anyway, I really need to use your computer.
That was quick.
- Why don't you use your own laptop? - I locked it in my safe.
So? Combination to my safe is on my laptop.
You didn't think to write it down We all wish we had the last five minutes of our life back, okay? I'm with you there! Anyway, I need to find a new place to get my eyebrows threaded.
Oh, you can just do everything else silently.
Whoa! - Schneider, you came here to watch porn? - No! Why won't it stop? No, I don't wanna chat with you! What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, come on, Pen.
No need to cover.
I'm just happy you weren't actually sittin' there clipping coupons.
And a threesome, eh? Get your freak on, boo! Shut up, that's not my porn.
- It's your computer.
- No, it's not my It's Alex's.
I'll just use the old eyebrow-threading place.
Oh.
My baby's watching porn.
My sweet boy is becoming a gross man! But, hey, silver lining, it's normal porn.
A threesome is not normal.
Okay, fine.
It's aspirational.
- How do I talk to him about this? - Uh you don't.
I'm not looking forward to this, either.
But I have to because he's obviously curious.
And I don't want it to get stuck in his brain that this is what sex is.
Yeah.
He'd be in for a long series of disappointments.
What kinda sex talk did your parents give you? Because I wanna do the opposite of that.
Well, Father believed it's best to have this kinda discussion in a car because you don't have to make eye contact.
Plus, you're traveling in the same direction, which fosters intimacy.
That's actually good advice.
I was expecting some unrelatable rich-guy story.
So we're in the Bentley with our chauffeur, Paco.
Father said it's time to have the talk.
We came to the next stoplight.
He hopped out, Paco told me everything.
I need a Paco.
I got a cousin named Paco, but he's an idiot.
Ay, it's not fair that I'm stuck giving both sex talks.
Alex was supposed to be Victor's job.
- I did my part with Elena.
- How'd it go? Not great.
She asked me what a period was when she was seven.
I didn't get the period talk till I was 12.
Paco just called it "Shark Week.
" Well, they say you should answer every question honestly, so I did.
And I ended up going from periods into the whole sex talk.
Then, Elena said "Cool! What's an exclamation point?" Lucky she didn't ask about a colon.
Sorry, it's just fun to hear about how you blew it.
It's not like I had a great role model.
My mom's sex talk was her handing me a white handkerchief and telling me it was my virginity.
"Lupita, nobody wants to marry a used handkerchief.
" "So, you must keep men from sneezing in it.
" Hello.
Here comes Professor Love now.
- So how was the opera? - Magnificent.
Oh, when Violetta died of consumption Hey, hey.
Spoilers.
Sorry, it's just that her death scene was so Aw.
Aw! Here, you may have my handkerchief.
Thank you.
I feel dirty.
The singing was very good.
But the choreography could have used a little tweaking.
I gave my number to the usher.
I'm sure he'll be calling.
Uh, what was the name of that soprano? Oh, do you mind if I just look it up quickly? No! Oh, my stars.
I feel compelled to tell you that this is not my computer.
No, it's Alex's.
That's what we've been talking about.
What? What about Alex? Mami, don't worry.
It's not really a big deal.
Alex was watching a racy movie.
Cars 2? More like Cars 3.
Okay, let's stop talking about this.
Yeah, whatever it was, don't worry.
You know, it's normal for a teenage boy and it's healthy to be curious.
I'm curious.
I wanna see how that movie ends.
Boy, the world has changed.
I Just think how difficult it was to see a naked woman in the Renaissance.
You had to pay someone a fortune to create a giant nude painting that you couldn't hide from your wife.
When I was a kid, there was an adult section in the back of the video store.
Behind the beads.
I'd always chicken out and just rent a Jane Fonda workout tape.
Still worked.
Still works.
That's the thing.
It used to be hard to get.
Now there are no restrictions.
You can get a Renaissance painting right on your computer.
All of this is exactly why I need to talk to Alex.
You know, with the Internet, kids see too much too soon.
Then porn makes them grow up thinking that's what sex is supposed to be like.
How bad was this movie that papito was watching? - Awful.
- Pretty tame.
Okay.
Show me.
Yeah, that's not happening.
Lydia, you asked me to turn away when you buckled your shoe.
This is not for you.
- Por favor.
- No, Mami.
Â¡Mira! I was married for over 40 years.
If anything, it is a shame that Berto and I went unrecorded.
- Â¡Dame esa cosa! - Ay.
Burn this.
Why is everyone staring at me? Is there a bug on me? Is there a bug on me? No, papito, you are bug-free and perfect as always.
Yeah.
Stand there, so I can always remember you this way.
Finn sent me a video to check out.
Have you seen my laptop? No! What's wrong? Does it have a virus? It is sick.
Yes.
Is anybody gonna tell me what's going on? - Yeah, I'm out.
- Yes, I should probably go, too.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
Okay, sit down.
We need to talk about something.
I am going to leave.
Because this, like many things in life, can best be done only between two peoples.
- Seriously, what's going on? - Don't worry.
It's nothing bad.
- It's just about sex.
- Oh, God! Okay Great start.
Ay Look It's totally natural for you to be curious about sex.
If you ever have any questions, I want you to feel like you can come to me.
Do you have any questions? Yes.
When is this going to be over? I get it.
This is uncomfortable for me, too.
But it's important to talk about this stuff.
Because I just I want you to understand that sex can be a really beautiful experience.
I know.
But look there's reality, then there's pornography.
Why are you doing this to me? For instance, two women with one man, - it's just - What? What are you talking about? You can do that? Alex, it's okay.
I know you were watching a video like that on the computer.
- What? No, I wasn't.
- Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying.
I'm not stupid.
I know you put software into it that tells you everything I look at.
That's right, mister.
I did order that and installed that, and that's how I found out about this.
Mom, you gotta believe me.
I would never do that.
I spent my whole life trying to avoid this conversation.
Okay.
Well, then, if wasn't you, who was it? - Was it you? - No! It wasn't me.
- Abuelita? - No! Hey, guys! I'm exhausted.
Good night.
Elena! Well, that is unexpected.
Did she admit to watching it? I didn't have the heart to ask her about it last night.
After introducing my 12-year-old son to threesomes, I figured that was enough great parenting for one day.
I don't even know what I'm gonna say to Elena.
I can't believe I have to have another porn conversation.
Oh, you guys are talking about porn without my sexpertise? Great, I was hoping to get another opinion on this.
Yes, let's catch you up.
We were just saying that with all the porn available now, it's a real problem.
Yeah.
There's not enough hours in a day to watch it all.
Okay, so we heard from you.
Well, girls these days are exposed to so much more than my generation was.
Or your generation, Penelope.
- I mean, 15 is the new 25.
- Yes.
And I'm not naive.
But Elena's just not that advanced.
She's never even had a boyfriend.
She just started kinda seeing this boy named Josh, but all they've done is kissed.
Aw, you're adorable.
I'm sure Josh is the one teenage boy that loves just kissing.
Maybe I should be worried about Josh.
Is he pressuring her? It is confusing for girls out there.
I'm glad I got married so young.
I was still a "virgin.
" - What do you mean? - You know, a "virgin.
" What's this? I was a good Catholic girl, so I wanted to save myself for marriage.
But there are other ways to do it that are creative but keep you pure.
"Technically" pure.
I guess we'll all spend the rest of the day thinking of ways to look Lori in the eye.
I totally forgot about that Catholic-girl workaround.
No, I know a bunch of stupid girls who used No, that's not what I Ay, whatever.
You got snowed.
I need to talk to Elena.
- Do you want me to talk to Josh? - I don't even want you to talk to me.
- Big plans this weekend? - Don't look at me.
Where's Elena? I really need to talk to her.
You should.
She is a porno.
I think I know what you're saying, and it's not fair 'cause when you thought it was Alex, you said it was healthy.
Well, boys are supposed to want the sex.
Girls are supposed to pretend that they don't want the sex.
Read your Bible, for God's sake.
Watch the hair, Abuelita.
- Is Elena in her room? - No, she's at Josh's.
The family is having a movie night, remember? - That's tonight? - Yeah.
Jeez, she's been at Josh's, like, every day this week.
Great.
Straight to voicemail.
Elena, I really need to talk to you, so call me as soon as you get this.
No, better yet, just come home right away.
No, scratch that.
Come home right away, but still call me so I know you're coming home.
This is your mother.
It's fine.
I shouldn't worry 'cause she's with his family, right? Yeah! What? What is it? Well, it's just that some kids at school said Josh is having a party because his parents are out of town.
No parents? That's terrible! I know! Who's gonna order the pizza? Who's gonna clean up the mess? Mami, parties are not good.
There's alcohol.
Then people pair off.
And the next thing you know, Carlos PiÃ±ero's trying to unhook your bra on your best friend's parents' bed.
But not me, Mami, I never did that.
I'm happy to just leave.
Oye.
No seas ridÃ­cula.
Elena would never give away her purity at some party.
Ah, yes.
- Yes, you're right.
- Of course.
She's a good Catholic girl.
Oh, my God! What is this? There's no party.
There's just three of them.
Three.
As you can see, ladies, I've got more than enough for the both of you.
Ooh, relax, I got it.
Elena! - Mom, what are you doing? - What are you doing? I'm watching a movie with Josh and his little sister! You scared me.
What's going on? Hey, Barb, Dave.
Ooh.
Love these hardwood floors.
What is this, bamboo? - Penelope, would you like to come in? - Yeah, sure.
You know, let me just unwedge myself from your doggy door before I embarrass myself.
Just hold still.
Oh.
It's good to see you two.
All here.
Not out of town.
- Why would we be out of town? - No reason.
Just 12-year-olds who don't know anything, they say a lot of stuff.
We must not have heard you knock.
We were watching a movie.
- Would you like to join us? - No.
No.
Thank you.
No, I just came by to bring Elena my jacket.
There you go.
Okay.
I'll just put it on over this jacket.
Okay.
I'm gonna go now.
Yeah.
Oh, just so you know, some maniac drove over your mailbox.
But they left 50 bucks, so that seems fair, right? Guess what? Josh's parents? Home.
You got fed some bad intel.
You gotta up your gossip game, son.
Oh yeah.
It turns out it was Josh B's parents who were out of town, not Josh F's.
You didn't think to text me that? You know I always have my phone on me.
Unplug, Penelope.
Hey.
- You're back early.
- Yeah.
I left because I was embarrassed.
Everyone was talking about my mom, who ran over the mailbox to bring me a jacket.
Sounds like you got a pretty cool mom.
Look, I am sorry.
But we do need to talk.
Oh, about what? Here.
You're gonna want this.
Why does everybody think I'm cold? What is going on? Why are you acting like a freak? Okay, Elena, I'm just gonna say it.
I know you've been looking at pornography.
Oh, my God.
I found it on your brother's computer.
Thanks for an unnecessary yet super-fun conversation with Alex, by the way.
Sorry.
I would've used my computer, but I didn't want it to get a virus.
Elena, that is pretty smart, actually.
But I still would've found out because I have that tracking software on all your computers.
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't! Okay.
Obviously you're curious about stuff.
And that is completely normal.
It just makes me wonder if you're thinking about or possibly having, you know sex.
I don't want you to feel like it's wrong.
It's actually a really beautiful experience that you're too young to be having right now.
But if you are I want you to be safe I want you to be doing it for the right reasons, and not because you're feeling pressured.
And I I want you to come to me.
Because I didn't have that with your abuelita, and I want things to be different.
- Mom, I'm not having sex.
- Oh, thank God! You're way too young.
And guys are really bad at it in the beginning.
Not that I want you to be with an older guy.
- Mom, stop talking! - Oh.
I'm gonna stop talking.
I'm gonna stop talking.
I felt like I was gonna black out there for a second.
Okay.
I just, like Oh, my Just everything is happening so fast.
You know, Josh is your first boyfriend.
I know, and I really like him, but I don't think I like him like that.
Hey that's okay.
In fact, that's great.
You know, you you got your whole life ahead of you.
There'll be plenty of other boys.
I don't think I'll ever fall in love with a boy.
Aw.
Yeah, I get it.
I've been there.
But I promise you, when you meet the right one, you'll know.
What if that's not what I want? Oh, I know.
Marriage is a patriarchal tool invented to enslave women.
All men are adult babies.
I know.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about love.
And I'm so happy that we're talking like this.
Because you can tell me anything.
Okay.
Then what I'm trying to say is that when I think about love I see myself someday loving a woman.
Oh.
Why do I keep giving everyone the wrong sex talk? When did you No.
You know, you talk.
It was just, I realized that if I was going to be into a boy, it would be Josh.
I mean, he's cute, and he's sweet, and he's such a gentleman, but I feel more when I look at a picture of Kristen Stewart than I do when I kiss him.
No wonder you saw those Twilight movies so many times.
Definitely wasn't for the quality storytelling.
Guess this also explains the threesome movie.
- Can we not talk about that ever again? - Nothing would make me happier.
So Are you okay with this? Of course I am.
I love you.
And I want you to be happy.
And you should never be afraid to tell me anything about yourself.
Thank you.
I've been wanting to tell you for a really long time.
I'm glad you did.
Thank God.
It feels like this huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
Like the hardest part is over.
Hello, you two! Maybe not the hardest part.
[rapid knocking on door] - Who is it? - It's Penelope.
Open up.
One in the morning, eh? Okay.
Either something happened in your apartment, or something's about to happen in mine.
Ugh! You'd be surprised how many of my hookups started with "Ugh!" [Penelope sighs] Elena just came out to me.
[sighs] Finally! That is a load off my mind.
- You knew? - Yeah.
It's been super tough keeping it from you.
That's why I've been hanging around so much less.
You've had dinner with us four times this week.
Crazy, right? I'm like a ghost.
Anyway, she never actually told me.
Alex did.
- Wait, Alex knows, too? - Yeah.
But it hasn't affected him at all.
And I walked him through everything I know about lesbians.
Don't worry.
I barely know anything.
So, Alex is cool, Elena is cool.
Great.
Great, great, great.
[chuckles] - You don't sound great.
- I'm not great.
[sighs] Can I admit something dark to you? When you eat sushi, you sometimes imagine the fish screaming? I feel really weird about all this Elena stuff.
Whoa.
Are you homophobic? No! I would never judge anyone based on their sexual orientation.
Some of my best friends are gay.
Yeah, that's actually not something I know you're not supposed to say that! It's just that now that it's my daughter, it's different.
I hate that I feel weird about it, but I do.
- Well, what does your mother think? - [chuckles nervously] When she finds out, you'll know, because she'll be on the roof with a Bat-Signal shaped like the pope's hat.
He does have a popemobile.
And a cape.
Huh.
Focus, Schneider.
Okay, hey, sit down.
[sighs] My advice? If you're feeling weird hide it.
When I was 15, I told Father I wanted to be a professional tap dancer.
He laughed.
It was that lack of support that contributed to my drinking and drug problem.
Professional tap dancer? Oh, do you find that amusing? Because 15-year-old Schneider's drinking peach schnapps out of an unused tap shoe right now.
- [sighs] - Oh, God, you're right.
My reaction could really affect Elena for the rest of her life.
She needs to think that I'm cool with everything because I don't want her to turn out like, no offense, you.
Schneider, you coming back to bed? Yeah, I do all right.
You have a girl over here and you were offering to have sex with me? Yes, Penelope.
That's the kind of friend I am.
[theme song playing] Hi, Mami.
She can't hear me.
There's my perfect daughter who I love so much, but won't call beautiful because she doesn't like it when people emphasize the importance of physical appearance.
Uh, good morning to you, too.
Hey, last night I did a little reading on Autostraddle, the lesbian lifestyle and pop-culture website? - Really? - Yeah! I learned a ton of interesting stuff.
Fun fact, did you know monocles had a huge following in the stylish lesbian circles of the early 20th century? If this is your way of telling me that you're getting me a monocle for my birthday, I'm gonna be really upset.
Or we could talk about Gaga instead.
- Lady Gaga? - Yeah.
Is she a gay icon, or just a publicity monger? I don't know, she's, like, a thousand years old.
So you're probably not interested in what I found out about Eleanor Roosevelt? Tons of monocles.
[chuckles] Mom, I get it.
You're aggressively okay with my sexuality.
Of course! Who wouldn't be? DJ Abuelita over there? [softly] Oh, all right.
I'm worried about coming out to her.
Oh, really? You're not ready to have her follow you in the streets, ringing the shame bell? I think I'm gonna wait until after my quinces.
All she's talked about the past two weeks is my stupid dance with Josh.
[sighs] Right.
Ay.
Poor Josh.
How's he gonna handle this? I bet he's gonna feel really weird about it.
But that's understandable, right? No, I already told him and he's totally cool.
I mean, he insisted on being my dance partner to show his support.
Awesome! I'm glad everyone is so cool and doesn't feel weird in any way at all.
[chuckles] You go, Josh! [chuckles] Ah! There are my beautiful niÃ±as.
Elena, I'm doing the final tweaks on the quinces choreography, so I really want you to concentrate on your posture.
Head high, shoulders back.
Straighter.
Straighter.
Be as straight as you can be! Oh, my God, you guys.
I just got an e-mail from my baseball coach and I made the travel team! Him.
He made the travel team.
Oh! [chuckles] [Schneider] Oh, man.
All those practices I took you to finally paid off.
I did it! Him.
He did it.
I'm so pumped.
Travel team is the first step toward the big leagues.
Mom, when I get there, I'm buying you a house.
Aw.
So sweet, honey.
But it won't be near my mansion.
No one wants their mom around when they're dating models.
Just being real with you.
You still have Spider-Man sheets.
Just being real with you.
But congratulations, papito! - That's great news! - [clapping] - That's terrible news.
- Huh? There is no way he can join that team.
- What? - Why? Those games are so far away, you have to spend the night.
I can't miss that much work.
Well, I probably can.
Let me just check with my boss.
Schneider? You do you.
We're good.
So how about I take Alex to travel games? [both laughing] - What? - Just it's You don't get it.
It's not about you.
We're Cuban.
We don't trust anyone, outside of blood, to look after our kids.
You want to take him on a trip overnight to a strange city? Jajaja.
QuÃ© funny.
Sorry, Schneider.
Look, I barely trust her with the kids.
And I'm offended, but I get it.
Come on.
I think you're being a little unfair.
I can take care of Alex as well as you can.
[both scoffing] All right.
You think you got what it takes? Bedtime? 9:00 p.
m.
weekdays.
10:00 p.
m.
, weekends.
- Blood type? - O positive.
Wrong.
Red.
Mami, I got this.
Preferred sandwich, tuna or turkey? Trick question.
He's allergic to tuna, and as for a turkey sandwich, he would quote, "Rather drink a cup of barf.
" Look, I can send constant updates, drop GPS pins of his location.
I know a guy at the pet store, we could chip him.
[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [in English] Okay, fine.
You can take him.
But if my son comes back with even a little scratch on his head I was in the army.
I don't know how to waterboard, 'cause they don't teach it [whispering] except they do.
- And one, two, three, four - [tapping rhythmically] five, six, seven, eight.
Point that toe Move the hips - Not like that.
- Oh.
Arms up and pull her close.
[sing-song] Closer.
Closer.
Closer.
[sighs] Ay, quÃ© bien.
And this would be the moment when you would kiss, but you shouldn't.
Unless I look away right now.
Oh is that Andy Garcia? Oh, you are exchanging secret looks.
How am I going to keep you two lovebirds apart? - Oh! [chuckles] - [laughing] Oh, whoa! This is giving me flashbacks of Tiana's quinces/baby shower.
She is jealous.
Josh, you will be the envy of every boy at the quinces.
And, Elena, all of the girls will wish it was them inside your dress.
[chuckles] Dare to dream.
[cell phone rings] Uh-oh Why are you calling, Schneider? Is Alex hurt? You might have a two-hour head start, but I will hunt you down.
Relax, everything is great.
I was calling to let you know we checked into the hotel twelve minutes ahead of schedule.
Hey, Ron.
Hey, Nikki.
Finn's mom is, what she calls, out-of-town single.
But don't worry, I got my eye on the ball.
- How's the hotel? - [clears throat] "His room is close to a fire escape and the nearest elevator was inspected on April 17th by an S.
Balaban.
" [clears throat] Ooh, I gotta run.
Walk carefully.
I mean, walk carefully.
No one's running.
[Lydia] Ay, mi niÃ±a preciosa.
[speaking Spanish] [in English] What's happening? - I just came out to Abuelita.
- [chuckles] You did? And I think it's beautiful.
[gasps] You do? Claro.
And I accept it immediately, no questions asked.
[chuckles] Well, that is great.
[chuckles] Ms.
Alvarez, you have the coolest family.
I'm gonna call my grandma.
Maybe she's finally ready to hear that I'm a vegan.
I'm gonna Skype Carmen and tell her the awesome news.
- [chuckles] - I love my family! We love you, too.
[laughing] I told you.
Wait, so you're not okay with it? No, I am very upset.
Oh, thank God.
I mean, thank God, Mami, that you're so honest with your feelings.
Yeah, I know you don't agree with them, because you are so liberal and I'm just a narrow-minded homofallopian.
- You mean you're homophobic? - Ha! There is the judgment.
Look I know you are cool with this, but you have to understand.
I am a religious woman.
[clicks tongue] I know, Mami.
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but I have a problem with Elena being gay.
- [breathes deeply] - It goes against God! Although, God did make us in his image.
And God doesn't make mistakes.
Clearly.
And when it comes to the gays, the pope did say, "Who am I to judge?" And the pope represents God.
So what, am I going to go against the pope and God? Who the hell do I think I am? Okay.
Okay, I'm good.
[exhales heavily] What? You just worked that out in ten seconds? SÃ­.
Because she is my granddaughter and I love her no matter what.
Ya.
So, tell me, when is the parade? [laughs] Okay, you guys wait here.
I'll check for intruders, put a safety lock on the toilet seat, and sweep for tuna.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Okay, guys.
Guys, slow down.
- This room is awesome! - Ow! Okay.
- Dibs on this bed.
- No, this bed! - Guys.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, wait.
Okay, stop.
Stop! So, you're obviously tired from the game.
Maybe it's time for bed.
It's six o'clock.
Yeah, Mr.
Schneider, don't you wanna go hang out with the other parents? [scoffs] Finn, you little rascal that I don't trust.
- Who wants to play a game of I Spy? - This guy! When I was three.
Jajaja.
QuÃ© funny.
Okay, I'll start.
[clears throat] I spy, with my little eye, something that is clearly a fire hazard! Hey, Mr.
Schneider, can you go get us some ice? What? Is someone injured? Oh, my God.
Is it Gordon? Yeah, he does not look well.
I'll be back in a jiff.
Everybody, stand under the sprinklers.
Ramona, thank you, thank you for meeting me! So great to see you.
So, uh, a gay bar, huh? Immersion therapy.
You gotta get used to being around gay people, now that I know you hate us.
[scoffs] I don't hate gay people! No, I don't.
You heard that "I don't" part, right? Ay, next round's on me.
[chuckles nervously] Okay, I'm a mess.
I need some gay guidance.
[sighs] - Let's just call it guidance.
- Okay.
That's good.
That's what I need, already.
[chuckles] Okay? - [sighs] I'm feeling weird.
- [chuckling] [laughs] I am.
I'm feeling like if I knew more, I might feel better.
I don't know.
Does she all of a sudden think all boys are disgusting? No! She always thought they were disgusting.
Okay.
How will I know if a girl she brings home is a friend or more? Oh [whispers] You ask her.
Is she gonna tell me the truth? - Probably not.
- Ay, Ramona! Well, what are you asking me? How to spot a lesbian? I mean, do some of us have short hair? Sure.
Do we sometimes prefer practical, gender-neutral clothing? I guess.
Does a perfect day involve going to candle-making class in our Subaru with a roof rack full of antiques? That's just solid American fun.
[chuckles] Okay.
Now, I'm definitely more confused.
Look, you are raising a smart girl who will be a productive member of society.
She's gonna have a full life and be okay.
- Thank you.
That's good.
- Good.
- Great.
Mmm-hmm.
- Great.
- You still feel weird.
- I still feel weird! Mmm.
[chuckling] You know what might help you? To see me in action.
- How would that help? - Honestly, I don't think it would, but I'm getting some serious eyes from that guapa over there.
I thought you were here to give me guidance.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They can both wear dresses to the wedding, - it'll be fine.
- Ramona! - Uh, you wanna go over there? - No! No, no, no, no, no, no.
[chuckles] But just out of curiosity what is that girl doing right now? She's looking at you and biting her lower lip.
[both chuckling] I gotta go.
Hey, parents.
I don't want to alarm you, but the kids may already be dead.
- What the hell you talking about? - What? What are you I got locked out of the room and they're up there jumping on the beds.
[Ron chuckles] Don't worry.
The boys are fine.
Yeah, that's the magic of hotel rooms.
All they want to do is hang out in there.
Yeah, they get excited by tiny soaps and sewing kits.
Kids are so stupid.
[chuckles] Well, maybe I am overreacting.
Yes.
Maybe just for a minute.
[chuckles] Oh, sorry.
What can I say Cubans are crazy about family.
Oh, you Cuban? Not by birth, but spiritually, I identify as Cuban.
That's why I've been so overprotective.
It's what we do.
[chuckles] I think we have some trust issues because Castro and all of that.
[sighs] You know.
But it's good to get an outsider's perspective.
You guys have calmed me down.
Maybe I was being a little suffocating.
I need to talk to you about your kids.
Ay, Dios mÃ­o.
- Don't mess it up.
Oh, and you know it.
- [music playing] [sighs] Drinking alone? This is a gay bar.
That's what regular bars are for.
Yeah, but regular bars don't have $7 Queen-a-Coladas.
Mmm, tell me about it.
This is my third Bloody Gary.
Anyway I'm drinking alone 'cause I'm a monster and monsters drink alone.
My daughter came out to me and I am not totally okay with it.
[clears throat] And I hate myself for it.
Keep the Queen-a-Coladas coming.
All right, all right.
This is a subject that I know a thing or two about, so talk to me.
It's just that I'm ruining everything.
I want her to have the most perfect coming-out story.
You know, where I'm cool and supportive and we high-five and ride unicorns down a rainbow together.
[chuckles] Okay, so, gay people aren't magic.
But it's a common misconception, so I should be feeling really happy that she feels comfortable enough to come out to me.
But I just keep thinking It's not the way I pictured it.
I always imagined that we would bond over boy stuff.
How hot they are, how dumb they are.
[chuckles] The pregnancy scare.
I hold her hand while she pees on a stick.
We don't trust that stick, so she pees on a second stick.
It's negative and we go get sushi.
[chuckles] You know, you can still get sushi without peeing on something.
[chuckles] It's not the same.
How long ago did your daughter come out? Thirty-six hours ago.
Thirty-six hours and you're not leading a pride parade? [scoffs] No, but my mom is.
Let's get real.
Do you love her any less? No, of course not.
So you're just not there yet.
This is a complete readjustment of how you see your daughter.
Trust me, she's been thinking about this for months or years.
You just found out.
Your heart is okay.
You just need a little time for your head to catch up.
[sighs heavily] [sighs] I feel a thousand times better.
Thank you! Oh! [sniffs] Oh, my God, you smell so good.
[laughs] Oh, this means so much coming from a super-hot gay guy.
Oh, thank you! [chuckles] I'm not gay.
- [chuckles] - Well, you're at a gay bar.
And you're super hot.
[chuckles] [chuckles] Again, love what you're saying, but, uh, I'm here with my brother.
He's gay.
And to your point, it took me some time to wrap my head around it.
But now I'm good.
And you will be, too.
Thank you.
I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize for the smelling and the groping.
Somehow when I thought you hated the touch of women I assumed it was okay.
Luckily, I was too distracted by how cute you are to hear anything you just said.
What? [chuckles] Shut up.
Can I see you again? Like, over dinner? Okay.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I think this is the first time I've ever been asked out in a gay bar.
- Really? - Yeah.
I've been asked out, like, nine times in the past hour.
Hi, Mom.
Hi! Wait.
It's 11:00 at night.
You're supposed to be in San Diego.
What happened? Okay, first of all, I wanna point out that Alex is 100% okay.
So there's absolutely no need to panic.
What happened? Nothing.
Nothing? The boys stole two maid's carts and were racing them down the hallway! And I won! Not the point.
I get it.
Fortunately, security found me before anything else happened.
Found you? You weren't with them? - [sighs] - Get the water boards.
Wait, I don't understand.
If he's okay, why didn't you just call? [scoffs] Because there's, like, a zero percent chance you would believe Alex was all right unless he was standing right in front of you.
You guys, I'm so sorry.
I mean, a maid's cart? More like death wagon.
Tiny soaps you can choke on.
Shower caps that can fly off into your face and suffocate you.
And is that a clean toilet brush? I think not! [sighs] Anyway, now you're gonna yell at me and tell me I'm never allowed near your family.
Just make it quick.
[Schneider sighs] Aw I got in your head.
What? I made you as overprotective and crazy as I am.
You proved I can trust you.
- Really? - Yeah, you're Cuban now.
Â¡AzÃºcar! [chuckles] But we only forgive once.
God, I feel so much better.
And that is the last time I listen to a bunch of gringo parents.
They do not share our values.
- It sounds like Texas isn't that bad.
- [Carmen] I love it.
I'm really getting into saying y'all.
I'm like a little southern belle.
[knocking on door] Hi, Elena.
Hi, Carmen! Hi, Ms.
Y'alvarez.
Can I just give you props for being hella cool about Elena coming out? Thank you, Carmen.
I'm just happy that Elena is such a strong young woman - with a clear sense of herself.
- [chuckles] And she has excellent taste in friends.
Compliments make me kind of queasy, so I'm gonna bounce.
I'm going to the rodeo tomorrow.
Hopefully, one of the clowns will get gored.
[both laughing] I love that little weirdo.
Whoo! You're in a good mood.
- Am I? - Yeah, why? Okay, I met a guy.
- What? - Yes.
- Dish.
Tell me everything! - [chuckles] Okay, his name is Ben.
I met him at a gay bar.
- What? That's right, I'm cool.
- [both chuckle] He was there with his brother, and he was super cute and easy to talk to, and then he wasn't gay.
And then he asked me out! - Shut up! - I mean, who knows if he'll even call, but it was just exciting, you know, meeting someone new and flirting, making a connection.
I can't wait for that.
[chuckles] It'll happen.
And I hope you'll keep me in the loop when it does.
[scoffs] Are you kidding? I'm going to tell you everything.
- [chuckles] - Mmm.
So, here's a question.
You and Carmen? [scoffs] Oh, no! We're just best friends.
I mean, she says [mimicking Carmen] "All love is a selfish sickness.
" [sighs] - [normal] Her boyfriend is miserable.
- [both chuckle] [cell phone vibrates] [gasps] Oh, my God! It's Ben! [chuckles] "It was so great meeting you.
Best part of my night.
" - Should I text back? - No, no.
Play it cool.
You play it cool.
I'm texting back.
No, no, Mom, you have to play hard to get! No, I don't wanna play hard to get!
[both moaning] - [horn honks] - [both laugh] [sighs] Is it weird that we're sneaking around to make out like kids when our actual kids are waiting at home? Yeah.
Before I left the house, my 15-year-old told me to tone down the makeup and be home by 11:00.
Ah, screw her.
She's so lame.
That's weird.
My daughter said, "Fifth date, Dad.
" Don't bother coming home unless you get some.
" She's three.
Hmm.
[chuckles] I hate to let her down, but I'm more of a seventh-date kind of girl.
Unrelated, do you want to go on two dates tomorrow? [chuckles] Actually, my friends are having a dinner party.
Do you want to come? - [cell phone chimes] - Ay! - Yeah, you're right.
It's too soon.
- No, I wanna come.
This "ay" was for my mom.
My ex is coming back from Afghanistan for Elena's quinces, and she keeps texting me.
"Pick up his favorite soda.
Pick up his favorite potato chips.
Take him back, so I can die a happy woman.
" [Ben] Hmm.
So your mom's really into your ex.
That's great.
Victor's in the past.
And I'm putting my phone on silent.
[both] Mmm.
[cell phone vibrating] - [Ben moaning] - [cell phone chimes] [grunting] That's me.
"Dear Lupe's friend.
Is her phone on silent, or did you kidnap her?" How does your mom have my number? I don't know.
[theme song playing in Spanish] [Victor over computer] That really happened.
I'm not kidding.
[laughing] Ay, quÃ© bueno, you are home.
We are Skyping a handsome, available man in Afghanistan.
[chuckles] It's Victor.
Your husband? - [Victor] Is that your mami I hear? - Yeah, she wants to say hi.
Hi, Victor! Everything good? Great.
See you next week.
Mami, I need some help in the kitchen.
In a minute.
Victor is showing us a picture of a funny camel.
It is very tiny.
It has no humps.
And it is a dog.
So quick question.
When Papi's here next week, do I have to, like, hang out with him? [chuckles] The whole reason he's coming home is for your quinces.
Plus, we haven't seen him in over a year.
I love Papi, but we have nothing in common.
Every time we Skype, we just stare at each other until one of us thinks the screen froze.
And sometimes I just pretend it Look, I get it, - but it's only for a few days.
- [sighs] And, uh, where are we with the idea of telling him? Oh, who thinks it's a good idea to greet my Latino veteran dad with, "Hey, I like girls!" You'll finally have something in common.
So, Lupita, aren't you going to talk to Victor? No.
Right, not the way you look.
Here, you need a lipstick.
- Oh, thank you.
- [lipstick clatters] I am telling you, he is back to how he used to be.
I know he says he's sober, which is great, but he needs to get actual help or the drinking and the pills could start all over again.
Plus, he's not even dealing with his PTS.
Oh, but he looks so healthy.
His skin is glowing.
Hashtag, no filter.
[sighs] Victor and I are not a thing anymore.
- Okay? You got it? - Of course.
Oh, give him a chance.
Remember how you two used to sing the karaoke? And dance into the night? [gasps] And remember your wedding day? God, I looked beautiful.
Ooh, what are you doing, papito? Since Papi can't be here for my cello recital tomorrow, I'm gonna play my part of the quartet for him.
My God, he is a genius.
It makes more sense when the other three people are playing.
I wish you could be here.
[Victor] Oh, yeah.
Wouldn't it be cool if I could do that Star Trek thing where I could just transport there? I'd be all, "Oye, Scotty, beam me up, yo.
" - [knocking at door] - [chuckles] Whoa, it worked.
I was aiming for the living room.
I just missed.
- Papi! - [chuckles] - [thud] - [Victor] You grew! - Papi! - [chuckles] Okay.
Wow, look at you.
Beautiful, huh? You must be breaking all the boys' hearts.
[chuckles nervously] Looking good, viejita.
Vente pa' ca.
Dame un beso.
[chuckles] [Lydia speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] Okay, let's break it up.
Everyone has told everyone they're attractive.
[chuckles] Hiya, Lupe.
Hi.
Well, this is a surprise, because it's not a week from now.
But it's all good, 'cause I got your many messages and texts telling me you were coming early.
Oh, wait.
- None of that happened.
- [Victor] Yes.
I know, I'm early, but I really wanted to surprise papi chulo over here and see his cello show.
- Awesome.
- [chuckles] QuÃ© nice, quÃ© thoughtful Kay Jewelers.
They sell engagement rings.
- And anyway, Lupe, I booked a hotel.
- Okay, that sounds good.
That sounds outrageous.
He is family.
Family doesn't stay in a hotel.
Would you want me to live in a hotel? - Hello? - No, no, no.
Exactly.
You understand.
You know, we weren't expecting you for another week, and if you just drop in out of the blue like this, you can't really expect us to be ready for you, it's Ready.
Wow.
Is that a pillow mint? [chuckles] Can't Papi stay here, Mami? Yeah, sure.
Â¡Perfecto! You can have my bed.
I will sleep with Lupe.
Unless - No, it's fine.
- He can stay out here.
- Ay, quÃ© cosa linda.
Gracias.
- Claro.
Victor made breakfast.
He told me to relax.
Isn't he marvelous? Someone should take him off the market.
- Toma, Lupe.
- Oh.
- Good morning, Elena.
- Morning.
Hey, I made your favorite.
Clown face pancakes.
Huh? Let me guess, you don't like clowns anymore.
Or faces.
I just like to start with a protein because studies show it's better for developing brain Clown pancakes, what? It's about to be a circus in my stomach.
[chuckles] That's what I meant to say.
Yeah.
Oh, uh Quick, before you go to school, I have something for you guys.
I didn't get a chance to do this last night.
[sighs] - But, uh, I hope you like it, papito.
- [chuckles softly] Oh, maybe you can open that after Okay.
Dang! A new PS4! Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
Thanks.
Of course you can't play it unless your homework's done and only when Mami says it's okay.
And I'm just realizing I should've asked her before I even gave it to you, so now I'm just gonna stare this way and you tell me what her face is doing.
- You can keep it.
- Yes.
But if you mess up, it goes up on the shelf no one can reach.
- RIP Super Soaker.
- [Victor chuckles] And for Elena [gasps] [Victor] I know that you're a little too old for it.
But hear me out, okay? She's a princess.
But a Latina princess.
Yeah.
And she's all, like, empowered.
Yeah, she don't need no prince.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Thank you.
[chuckles] Hi, princess.
I'm Elena.
[imitates doll] "Hi.
My body proportions aren't representative" of a typical girl my age.
" [in normal voice] At least you know.
Yeah.
And and she comes with a purse, and, uh, pajamas and, um, a receipt.
Solid effort.
Come on, you guys.
Let's go.
You gotta go.
We'll see you after school at the recital.
- Can't wait.
- [Lydia] I'm going to go, too.
I will leave you two alone.
- Where are you going? - Grocery shopping.
At 7:00 in the morning? I like to beat the traffic.
- You're walking.
- Foot traffic.
It must be nice to have someone to help out, go grocery shopping.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Without her list or her purse.
Or leaving.
[sighs] So You're making breakfast, you're being thoughtful.
What are you doing? Just trying to be a decent dude.
I'm not the same person I was before I left.
- I mean, I'm still crazy cute.
- [scoffs] But, uh, I'm off the pills.
I'm sober now.
Been working a program.
- That's great.
- Yeah.
And the other stuff, the PTS? I'm dealing with it.
I'm in a good place, Lupe.
I'm a new guy.
Trying to be, anyway.
Good.
Good.
I'm in a good place, too.
Which Ay, so, look.
So I'm just gonna put it out there.
I'm seeing somebody.
What? Who is he? I'm gonna kick his ass.
Is what the old Victor would have said.
Right? Yeah.
But the new Victor says, "Get it, girl.
" - Okay.
[laughing] - It's all good.
I'm just telling you because I don't want it to be weird.
Although it was weird that you told me to get it.
But, uh, tonight, me and him have a thing.
- Okay.
- So you're cool? Well, I don't love it.
[scoffs] I mean, who is this guy? Is he a big part of your life? Hey, Pen! Which shirt do you think is better for the cello recital? I feel like the green one really brings out my eyes.
But then I thought it might be fun if we did a "the whole family wears blue" thing.
Hi, I'm Victor.
Is this the guy you're seeing? [both laughing] [both] Oh, my God! - You think he and I? - Like we would ever! [both laughing] Oh, my.
Whoo! I needed that.
Oh, man.
Me, too.
That was funny.
Oh, hey, man.
I'm Schneider, by the way.
[clears throat] She never told me you were so funny.
So you're just the guy who takes my son out to baseball and does all that dad stuff? [laughing] Are we still laughing? - I'm not.
- I am.
'Cause I'm afraid to stop.
You know what, I gotta be honest, I think I was happier when I thought you were sleeping with my wife.
Oh, sure, yeah.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Uh I never come down here shirtless or pantsless.
I never come down here.
How did I get here? I'm gonna go.
Okay.
But we'll see you at Alex's recital, right? Oh Yeah, I just remembered I double-booked with another middle school concert.
[chuckles] Recital season, am I right? Schneider.
Come on, don't be ridiculous.
Of course you're coming.
You'll both be there, and it'll be a good chance to get to know each other.
Yeah.
Come on, man.
You should come.
I insist.
Sounds fun.
Strangers in the night Exchanging glances Wondering in the night What were the chances We'd be sharing love Oh, man.
These people really need better entertainment.
- Or worse hearing aids.
- [chuckles] Look at you two, all over each other like the old days.
[laughs] Remember, love is the thing that keeps you warm in the night.
It is the quilt of passion.
Keep walking, viejo.
[laughing] What What happened to love is the quilt of passion? Yeah, that quilt is too old.
Are you okay there, buddy? Yep, yep, yep.
Glad to be here as a family acquaintance to support your son.
[clears throat] What's his name? Alvin? I don't know.
We're not that close.
Hey, great job coaching Alex's swing this season.
Widening his stance really made him a monster at the plate.
You must be so proud.
He lives here.
Early onset dementia.
Sad.
Listen, man, relax.
It's good, what you're doing for Alex.
I'm not around.
You should keep doing it.
Although I won't be over there much longer.
- You won't? - Nah.
Private security in Afghanistan? I mean, it's not exactly the kind of job you can grow old in.
[scoffs] Yeah, I know.
That's what I said when you went over.
Yeah.
You were right.
- Mom.
- What? What's wrong? Mrs.
Aaron's van got a flat, and she was moving all the instruments.
I don't have my cello.
I don't have my Jell-O either.
This sucks.
Bad news, everyone.
- No recital today.
- [all groan] I really wanted to show you in front of everybody.
You never get to be here for my stuff.
- We have to do something.
- What do you mean? We gotta stall.
I didn't come all this way to not hear my boy play the cello.
Schneider, I have a mission for you.
I need you to locate and recover that van, and retrieve those instruments ASAP.
You got it, Dad.
I mean, dude.
I mean I'm not looking for a father figure.
All right, we need a diversion until they get back.
Are you in, Sergeant Alvarez? What do you have in mind, Sergeant Alvarez? All right, everyone, uh, before you all leave, I happened to notice your karaoke machine.
And we have a very special guest who's played - [piano music playing] - showers from Echo Park to Afghanistan, Penelope Alvarez! You got this.
Let's give them a show.
Turn around Every now and then I get a little bit lonely And you're never coming round [Victor] Turn around You know, I should be embarrassed, but Mom and Dad are kinda cute up there.
- I did this.
- [Victor] Turn around A total eclipse of the heart Turn around bright eyes Turn around bright eyes Whoo-hoo! Thank you, active seniors of Silver Lake! Do you want to hear it a fourth time? I didn't hear it the first three times.
Oh, and now, I couldn't be prouder to introduce the St.
Bibiana String Quartet, starring cello superstar, Alex Alvarez.
[cheers and applause] - [mouths] Thank you.
- [mouths] You're welcome.
You glad you came back early for this? We messed up on a lot, but, uh I know a couple of things we got right.
[sobbing] - Whoo-hoo! - [all laughing] [Lydia] Oh! We were so awesome! [Victor] Wow.
Yeah.
I mean, we probably added five years to those old-timers' lives.
And papito, you were the best one in that quartet.
I mean, that's why they gave you the biggest violin.
Thanks.
Can we set up the PS4 now? I don't know.
What do you say, Mamita? - Yes.
- Great.
Oh, uh, but first I have something for Elena.
- [Lydia] Ooh.
- Um, yeah, I'm sorry about the doll.
Uh, I know sometimes I still think that you're a little girl.
But you've changed.
And I haven't been so good at keeping up.
But I want to.
A donation to Kiva in my name! Why are you giving money to a guy named Kiva when you could be giving money to a guy named Alex? Oh, Kiva is an organization that gives a loan to a small business in a developing nation.
They're amazing! How did you know I would like this? Well, I did a little research.
And, uh, well, somebody told me you were What was it? Annoying.
[Victor chuckles softly] A a social justice warrior.
Same thing.
Anyway, I don't know exactly how this works, but if we're ever in Tibet, we can visit a kickass yak dairy.
[squeals] Thanks, Papi! But we're still sharing that PS4.
I like video games, too.
Girls like video games, too.
- Don't you even.
- [Victor chuckles] I'm in, too.
I wanna Dance Dance Revolution.
Don't you have a dinner thing? Oh, that's right.
[chuckles] Aw, it's true love.
I'm sure Juliet forgot her date with Romeo.
[Penelope] Aw.
Okay.
Let me get outta here.
- And I'll see you guys later.
- [both] Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
- Okay, let's do it.
I'm gonna beat you, Papi.
Just like I used to beat you in Connect Four.
[Elena and Victor] Ooh.
[Victor] Tough talk, huh, papito? I actually got called to duty, so there's no way you can beat me at this game.
And Elena, you can't cheat in this game like you do in Scrabble.
[Elena] For the last time, seax is a real word.
- It's a Scandinavian roofer's tool.
- [Alex chuckles] [Victor] Wow.
You make Papi feel real dumb sometimes.
[all laughing] [Victor] All right, let's set this thing up, guys.
Lupe, one sec.
Tonight was fun, right? Yeah.
It was nice to have someone to share the load.
[chuckles] Listen, I I hope we're on our way to being good, you know, which is why I got a present for you, too.
- The divorce papers.
- Yeah.
I know you've been after me to sign them, so I did.
Once you do, it'll be official.
[sighs] Ay.
Wow.
[both chuckle] Thank you.
[Victor sighs] Have fun at your thing.
- That was great, wasn't it? - Oh, so great.
I absolutely loved your friends.
I can't believe that Emily and I went to the same grade school.
And we both mistrust the balloon guy at the farmer's market, 'cause that guy is full-on sketchy.
[chuckles] Sebastian and Peter are so cute.
Their wedding pictures were so romantic.
Love wins! We have to break up.
Are you intimidated by Sebastian and Peter? They have their problems, too, you know.
I've seen Peter fat-shame Sebastian.
It's not pretty.
It's not that.
[sighs] I just have a lot going on right now, you know.
Between the quinces, my family coming into town, my ex being back It's not fair to you.
If I can't be here, I shouldn't be here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And your ex being back.
[sighs] It's okay.
I get it.
So we're stopping after six dates.
Perfect! [chuckles] You watching me sleep, creepy lady? [chuckling] I should've known something was up.
You weren't snoring.
[chuckles] How was your thing? It was fine.
Home by 11:00? I don't think so.
Why are you with such a snooze, huh? We know you have good taste.
[sighs] Ay.
Well, if you must know, I broke up with him.
Oh, no.
Stop smiling.
Was I smiling? You better look closer.
No, no, no, no.
Come on, no.
None of that.
Come on, I swear, I just wanna spoon.
[scoffs] Oh, yeah.
You just wanna spoon? I invented that move.
Come on, let's just cuddle, naked.
Nothing can happen.
[chuckles] And then nothing turned into Elena.
Come on.
Just for a minute.
[both sigh heavily] So, thanks for the divorce papers.
Yeah, I can't wait to get you outta my life.
[chuckles] Oh, God, it's just so weird.
[sighs] Mami's convinced that we should get back together.
Ah, that viejita's no dummy.
- What? - Why do you smell like beer? Oh, uh, I had a few before bed.
- [chuckles] - [gasps] Okay.
[stammering] Uh, I mean, what do we do? We call your sponsor, right? I mean, is he in Afghanistan? Here? What? Where is he? - No.
No, no, no, no.
- Yeah! 'Cause that's part of working the program, right? Look, it's not that kind of program.
All right? What the hell kind of program is it, Victor? Okay, look, you're gonna have to trust me on this.
All right? I'm doing my own thing.
And it And it's working.
I promise.
Yeah, it seems like it's working.
Uh, listen, Penelope.
Okay, look, I'm off the pills, all right? And honestly, if I feel like having a couple of Coronas at the end of the day to take the edge off, that's that's a hell of a lot better than when I'd pop a fistful of Vicodin and watch 17 hours of HGTV.
[scoffs] Though I now know what a sconce is.
[sighs] Don't joke about this! You lied to me! No, I didn't lie, okay? I told you that I'm better and I am.
You're not gonna give me credit for that? No, I'm not.
No.
Not with your history, and not what we've been through.
You need to be in a real program.
Oh, what, at the VA? So I can wait a month to talk to some comemierda who's never even seen a second of combat? No, I don't think so.
I'm not doing that.
Oh, so so just to be clear you're not seeing anyone about your PTS? Look, I'm doing stuff, okay? Look, I'm keeping busy.
I'm working out.
- [sighs] Oh, God.
- All right? I can't believe I let you do this to me again.
Stop! Stop overreacting over a few beers.
- Overreacting? - Please! How many beers was it when you punched a hole in the wall above the bed, huh? How many beers was it when you woke the kids up in the middle of the night to say goodbye 'cause Daddy was gonna kill himself? Huh? I'm not saying this to hurt you.
I am saying this because I love you and I know who you are in here.
I remember who you were.
You've been through some hard stuff, babe, and and that's not your fault, but you need real help.
I'm helping myself! I'm doing what I'm doing, okay? And if you don't like it, well, then, that's your problem.
[Penelope sighs] Yeah, you're right.
That is my problem.
And I can't have that problem here with the kids.
So, you gotta go.
Stay at that hotel.
And the next time I see you is gonna be at Elena's quinces.
- All right.
Hey, look, I'm I'm sorry.
- No! - Come on, Lupe.
- Please! Just go.
Okay.
Lydia.
Lydia, hÃ¡blale.
Por favor.
Huh? No, Victor.
Go.
Eh? Mom, a tiara is a backward symbol of how women are only valued for their beauty.
And now that I'm wearing one I don't care.
I look awesome.
And it's super sparkly! - [shrieks] - [both laugh] I'm so glad you like it.
'Cause tomorrow's your quinces, and your only job is to be happy.
- [giggles] - Listen up, grunts.
In 55 minutes, we have the final venue walkthrough.
And you hear that rumble? Oh, yeah.
That's the sound of 183 Cubans arriving in Los Angeles.
Seventeen of whom will be staying in this room.
Er fire code-wise, I don't think that's gonna Shut it! I am going on no sleep and five Cuban coffees.
Do you really want to mess with me right now? [softly] No, ma'am.
As head of transpo you have one job.
Get the Cubans to and from the airport.
I hope you brushed up on your Spanish.
Claro que sÃ­.
[speaking Spanish] Claro que sÃ­.
I want it on the record that your tone is very annoying.
[scoffs] [in English] Okay.
You're kidding me, right? The day of my quinces, you screamed at TÃ­a Mirtha because she brought hot pink balloons instead of fuchsia.
Fuchsia is a royal color! Hot pink is what a girl wears on a spring break, before flashing her tetas.
[arguing in Spanish] [both arguing in Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Oye, why aren't you filming this? You want me to film you two arguing? I have hours of that.
In here.
Elena, your dress is in the closet.
If you should happen to find a straightjacket there, please bring it out here, for your crazy mami.
First arrivals are in 42 minutes.
And Schneider, I'm sorry that I'm in hyper-focused bitch mode, but really [sighs] thank you for doing this.
Pen, are you kidding me? You guys are like family.
Tick tock.
I just Mami, I really need this all to go perfectly.
Elena's been through so much this year.
I mean, the divorce, she came out to us, her creepy little goth friend moved away.
Ah, pobrecita Carmen.
So whatever Elena wants for her quinces, she gets.
Tres leches cake? I got you.
All white flowers? I got you.
Tables named after famous feminists? I had to do a lot of Googling, but, Elena, I got you.
And look at this seating chart.
What! I mean, I'm a humble woman, but that's art there.
And that reminds me, Victor's cousin Macho is bringing his girlfriend.
Mami, we said no girlfriends.
Apparently, they are in love.
Okay.
Fine, I got it.
We're gonna move you to the Frida Kahlo table, and the Oprah Winfrey table will go from eight seats to ten.
You get a seat! You get a seat! Everybody gets a seat! So [clears throat] how are you feeling about Victor? Fine.
[chuckles softly] Yeah, fine, and I have you to thank for it.
Between growing up Cuban and Catholic, I've got everything pushed way down.
You're welcome, mija.
Anyway, Victor knows I don't want to see him until the quinces.
And the kids still think he's staying at Schneider's because your bed hurt his back.
Bueno.
Yo [both exclaiming in Spanish] [Elena shrieks] Ooh.
[laughing] Thank you so much, Abuelita.
It's beautiful.
What's wrong with it? Nothing.
I'm happy, I'm smiling.
Exactly.
You are not sobbing with joy.
I have failed you.
I have failed my family.
I have failed Cuba.
[theme song playing in Spanish] Everything is all set for tomorrow.
And I just want to say, you have chosen the perfect ballroom.
Penelope.
This place is an acoustical nightmare.
Doc, what are you doing here? Practicing my toast, duh.
Oh.
The toast is kinda my thing.
So maybe you don't speak.
Don't worry, Leslie.
Elena's quinces is going to be a very special day for everyone.
[shudders] No.
Don't film that.
Excuse me.
Where is the dance floor? Um, you're standing on it.
Are you kidding me? I have relatives who escaped from Cuba on a raft bigger than this.
[speaks Spanish] Hey.
Hey, Lucy.
I'm sorry about her.
Let me translate.
She would like a larger dance floor.
Give the lady a bigger floor.
- Papi.
- Hey.
- [Elena chuckles] - Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
You're here.
Yeah.
I asked Papi to come so we could practice our father-daughter dance.
Oh.
Yeah, we have to do something really good to distract the audience because the song is super cheesy.
- [Spanish song playing over cell phone] - Ay, Julio.
Let them do that.
You help me sneak in the booze we bought at Costco.
Come on.
[song continues playing] Don't worry.
I found a more modern version for us to dance to.
Oh, I kinda like this one.
Me, too.
It's about, uh, how you look away for a second and you turn back and - your little girl's all grown up.
- [both chuckle] It's actually getting to me.
[sighs] Papi, I want to tell you something.
That I'm the greatest dancer you've ever seen? [whispers] I know.
That, and I have grown up.
And I've learned a lot about myself since you've been gone.
And I've changed.
- Well, not changed, but, um - Mmm-hmm.
I'm gay.
[chuckles] Yeah, and you're pregnant, too, right? [chuckling] Let's do all the shockers.
[stammers] No.
Papi, I'm I'm serious.
I came out while you were gone and I was just waiting for the right time to tell you.
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this? [inhales deeply] Okay, so this wasn't the right time.
Just don't be mad.
No, I'm not mad.
You're just confused.
I mean, you're 15.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
- [song stops] - What's going on? I told him.
Did you know about this? Yeah.
Just give us a sec.
Are you indulging whatever this is? Uh, you mean supporting our daughter? Yeah, I am.
No.
She's not She's not that way, okay? I've been gone a year.
What the hell's been going on here? Wow.
[scoffs] Okay.
Look, I didn't know she was gonna tell you, but now that she did, you're gonna have to figure out a way to be okay with it.
No, I don't have to be okay with anything.
She's mixed up, and you're her mother.
You aren't even trying to talk some sense into her? That's not how this works.
Oh, so we're all just supposed to pretend like this is cool? Because it's not.
All right? It's not.
It's my fault.
I kind of ambushed him and it's You didn't do anything wrong, baby.
Kinda worried he's not gonna come.
What? No.
No, he just needs a minute.
He's not good with change.
You should have seen him the first time he saw me without makeup.
Whoa! "Who are you right now? - "Why don't you have eyebrows?" - [chuckles] [speaking Spanish] Gracias.
[speaks Spanish] Don't freestyle.
Stick with the picture.
Follow Olguitita's example.
[gasps] And what the hell is a carnation doing in here? Mami, a word? When was the last time you slept? Two days ago.
Yeah, but don't worry.
I take little power naps when I pee.
[panting] Maybe you should lie down.
[mockingly] "Maybe you should lie down.
" What's happening? [sighs] Sorry.
There's just a lot to do.
And people say they want to help and friggin' Tina's over there doing her own thing, like she always does.
Keep your eye on her.
[Alex sighs] Hey, guys, what's taking so long? Oh, hi, Carmen.
Hi, Ms.
Alvarez.
Uh sorry you can't come to the quinces, but glad you could make it to the final fitting.
Elena wanted me to weigh in on her dress.
It's gorgeous.
La Diabla lies.
I have tried everything.
I have taken away the frills, I have put on the frills, I have made it longer, I have made it shorter.
But she is being impossible.
I told you I love every version of it See what I mean? Ay, Mami, we don't have time for this.
If the dress were truly perfect, she would be so overcome with emotion, her eyes would fill with tears.
Maybe what you're picking up on, is that I'm not really comfortable wearing a dress.
Of course, you are not comfortable.
It's called being a woman.
I am in agony all of the time, but I look amazing.
Not sure this is the lesson I want to be teaching, but I so want to check this box.
[sighs] All I'm saying is that I'm really figuring out what I am comfortable in.
Last week, I went to a thrift store and I got some jackets, some ties, a fedora, a pinstripe suit.
What? You want to look like Al Capone? Ooh, what about this? What about, instead of heels I wear my Doc Martens? I mean, all everybody else would see is the dress, but underneath there'd be one thing that's a little more me.
I love that.
Keeping the dress, wearing the Docs.
No more changes.
[Elena chuckles] You got it, okay! You're killing me.
Tina, baby's breath? Stop sneaking in unapproved flowers.
That's my boy.
All right, here's your last three Alvarezes.
De nada.
Can an hombre get a pastelito up in this boca? I learned more words.
[chuckles] - Hola.
Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡? - Hola.
- Ay, mira el niÃ±o tan lindo.
- Gracias.
[both speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] [continues speaking Spanish] [in English] I don't know these people.
- What? - Yeah.
You picked up the wrong Alvarezes.
Did you not look at the photos I gave you? I did.
But I don't want to be racist, so let's say I didn't.
All right.
Back to el Range Rover.
But first we will stop at El Pollo Loco on La Cienega Boulevard.
I'm running out of words.
Hey, Pen? - [whispers] Come here.
- Uh-huh? Just so you know, Victor's still upstairs in my apartment.
Yeah, thanks again for taking him in.
- Actually, I think he's leaving.
- What? He was packing up all his stuff while he was telling me about Elena's crazy phase and how everyone's coddling her.
I didn't want to kill the bro vibe we got going on, so I said, "I know, right, bro?" But what I was really thinking was, "Hell no, bro.
That's a no-go.
" So you know.
Hey there.
What's up, Lupe? I just wanted to make sure everything was cool.
You're not gonna do something stupid like not come to the quinces tomorrow? "Yeah, cool, Lupe.
I'll be there.
" "Oh, thanks, Victor.
" Look, I know this is all hitting you fast.
I was really thrown at first, too.
This isn't who she is, Lupe.
It's not.
It's a phase.
It's what kids do.
It's, like, cool now to be gay.
Oh, yeah.
That's it.
She wants a piece of that sweet bullying and persecution because being a teenager's not hard enough.
You know what? I'm not joking.
And I'm not here to fight with you.
Because this is not about us right now.
This is about your daughter.
And I know you love her.
And you know how much it means to Elena for you to be at her quinces.
Does the whole family know? No.
[door closes] She's only told a few people.
All right.
Well, that's good.
Don't tell anyone else.
- I'm not gonna tell anyone else.
- Good.
Because it's not up to me.
Or you.
It's up to Elena to decide who she tells and when.
But the one thing you do get to decide is whether you're gonna be there for your daughter.
Â¿Un pastelito? Â¿Un pastelito? Penelope, hola.
Â¿Un pastelito? Doc, I feel like I keep asking you this, but what are you doing here? I'm not sure.
I thought I would see everyone at the quinces tomorrow but, uh your mom told me to come over tonight.
[gags] Don't do that.
- Mom, don't freak out.
- What happened? It's gonna be fine.
But TÃ­a Mimi just got a call, and you know the Fajardos? Rosita, Diana, Marta, Cristina, Juanito and Baby Juanito? Can't come because of a baptism on Rosita's mother's side? They're coming.
Oh, come on! I should have known better.
The Fajardos are OG Cubans.
They run on Caribbean time.
Cristina was pregnant with Baby Juanito for 11 months, and she still thinks he was premature.
I don't know if we can fit in any more tables.
We are not adding another table.
I can make this work.
[gasps] I don't feel safe.
[gasps] [Penelope screams] Gracias, estoy bien.
Dr.
Berkowitz, would you mind helping me pick this up? Oh, absolutely.
It would be a pleasure.
[sighs] I feel like we dodged a bullet there.
Don't drag me down with you, buddy.
Oh, uh, Leslie.
Come into my room, please.
Oh, I can't deal with this right now.
No! There's no way you're gonna be able to fix this in time.
Oh, I'm about to go A Beautiful freaking Mind up in this bitch.
I'm kinda scared of you right now, so I'm gonna leave.
Yeah, it's a Jekyll-Hyde situation, so you should run.
[sighs] [breathes deeply] [snoring] [gasps] The Rosa Parks table should not be in the back! Where am I? Who put a blanket on me? Who brushed my teeth? [gasps] 10:03? Oh, my God! Is it the morning? Oh, my God! [panting] What? Did I die? Is this heaven? - [knocking on door] - Open up, it's Schneider.
[groaning] Oh, God, it's hell.
[grunts and pants] I got one last pickup.
You.
What is going on? The Cubans are missing, my seating chart is gone and I'm kind of attracted to you? Nothing makes sense.
Chill, girl.
Oh, that helps when you talk.
Thank you.
I am here to take you to your daughter's quinces.
So, get in that bedroom and put on all your clothes.
Whoa, I've never said that to a woman before.
Don't mess with me, weirdly sexy Schneider.
How did this happen? Who's in charge? It's handled, boo.
Nice work, Jay.
Tina, there's no confetti on Frida Kahlo.
Ay, Dios mÃ­o.
[sighs] Okay.
Now I'm in heaven.
Immigrants.
We get the job done.
I can't believe you pulled this all together.
Look at the centerpieces! Ay, Tina.
Muy bien hecho.
All is forgiven.
Yeah, most is forgiven.
Okay.
Have you seen your papi? No.
But I'm seeing too much of something.
Hey! Everything looks amazing.
And your papi's here.
[sighs] Okay, so I have made a few adjustments to the dress.
Mami, I already checked that box.
In ink.
[stammers] But it's just a few tweaks.
You won't even notice.
I should not have said anything.
- [Elena sighs] - Mira.
[sobbing and laughing] I [laughs] [Lydia] Oh! [gasps] Now, that is the response I have been waiting for.
Next time, don't make me jump through the hoops.
Hey, everybody.
Hello? [shouting] Hey, you guys! The room is yours.
Thank you, Mami.
[sighs] Victor and I would like to thank you all for coming.
And I'm probably gonna cry, so deal with it, mi gente.
August 7, 2001.
The doctor said Elena was due August 15th, but you know her, she ain't lettin' no man tell her when she gonna get birthed.
[all laughing] Elena has always been her own girl and now she's becoming her own woman.
When she was in third grade, she played the cherry tree in a school play.
And when George Washington swung his ax, she hit him back and yelled, "Trees are people, too!" [all laughing] And that's Elena.
Always sticking up for the underdog.
Whether it's a tree, an animal, a friend or me.
She's taught me more about being strong selfless and true to yourself than I could have ever taught her.
Okay, I can't hold it together anymore, so let's just bring the court out here! [all cheering] And now, let's welcome the girl of the hour Oh, I mean, the woman of the hour Elena Maria Alvarez Riera CalderÃ³n Leytevidal Inclan.
[upbeat music playing] [all cheering and whooping] Thank you.
Gracias.
You're welcome.
Are you ready? Are you sure? Carmen! Oh! What are you doing here? Schneider flew me out.
[slow song playing] How do you know all the steps? Your abuelita Skyped me every day for three months.
She was so mean, she made me cry.
I loved it.
[upbeat music playing] [speaks Spanish] [Lydia] Oye.
Mira.
[pop music playing] [all applaud and cheer] - Ah! [laughs] - Wow! What about the suit, huh? It was perfect.
And I could never have done it without Leslie.
- What? - Well, last night your mother said, "If you can suture, you can sew.
" So, I helped her make Elena's suit.
I was on a deadline.
I needed his nimble fingers.
Oh, such a talent! It's a shame you wasted your life as a doctor.
Okay.
So when you went in your room last night, you guys were Sewing.
What else did you think we Oh! QuÃ© mala.
QuÃ© sucia.
All right, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please, turn your attention to the dance floor for the father-daughter dance.
[applause] [guitar music playing] I got you.
I'm okay, you guys.
Thank you both for making me have a quinces.
I have to admit, this is pretty great.
Oh, you are welcome, mija.
[sniffs] I never tire of saying "I told you so.
" Eat it up, 'cause we're not doing this again until your wedding.
Oh, I'm never getting married, so [sing-song] I can't hear you.
The music's too loud! [salsa music playing]
Dale, Dylan, dale.
You got this! Stand right in there, don't be afraid of the ball.
- [THUDS] - [ALL GROAN] Just shake it off, Dylan! Shake it off! Yes! Way to take one for the team! Ay, por el amor de Dios it is so hot.
[SIGHS] - All right, Mami, let's do the wave.
- Okay.
[WHOOPING] Nope.
- [PENELOPE AND LYDIA] Boo! - Lame.
[PENELOPE] Okay, let's eat.
Mami, comida.
Okay, the rice and the frijoles are in the pickle jar - and the lechÃ³n is in the butter tub - Mm-hmm.
and the cookies are in the cookie tin, but they are not the same cookies that came with the tin.
- We forgot the napkins.
- Ah! Grab some from the snack bar.
They make you buy something, so one of you needs to create a distraction.
Elena, do that thing and ask if there's high-fructose corn syrup in the ketchup.
When she's boring the guy to death, grab the napkins and run.
Or I could just buy something? [SCOFFS AND LAUGHS] - You're hilarious.
- [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] I've been taking Spanish classes on the DL so I can be a more productive member of the family.
No offense.
Why would I be offended? You're not family.
You know I hate that joke.
Anyway, I always thought I was homolingual, turns out I'm bi.
Now I'm a little offended.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] He thinks you're my daughter.
There's something wrong with your ojos, hombre.
That means "eyes.
" I know what it means.
I mean, he's clearly a white guy and I'm clearly Latinx.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Latinx is a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina.
Okay.
And I'm clearly too young to have a 16-year-old.
- Actually - We're both offended! [BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH] [BOTH CHUCKLE] Spanish isn't exactly totes bueno so, if you want, I can teach you.
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- [TUTS] En espaÃ±ol I will rip your beard off and feed it to you.
En espaÃ±ol - Okay, Alex is up.
Here we go, Mami.
- Okay.
- Here we go, papito! - [ALL CHEERING] Come on, dale, bring Dylan home.
Go! Go! [GASPS] - Yes! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [ALL CHEERING] [ALL] Dale, papito, dale! Dale, papito, dale! Dale, papito, dale! Ooh! - That's new.
Where'd you get that from? - Walmart.
Dale, papito, dale! [THEME SONG PLAYING] [WHOOPS] What a game, papito! [LAUGHING] Hello, Dodgers? You want Alex Alvarez? We'll think about it! [ALL LAUGHING] A lot of your games are a real snooze, but today was good! - And then you got that hit! - Dale! [ALL] Dale, papito, dale! Dale, papito, dale! Whoo, look who's suddenly a sports fan.
Oh! It's not that.
I'm just proud of my heritage.
You know, my Cuban heritage.
Okay.
Dale means "go ahead" or "you go.
" It's slang, so it's kind of fluid.
Very Cuban.
You're Canadian! Papito is the best From the east into the west He's a baseball slugger And a real good hugger Oh! That is so cute and so true! - I just made it up! - I love it! Papito is the best From the east into the west He's a baseball slugger And a really good hugger Oh, my God, shut up! Did you just say shut up to God? Did you just say shut up to me? Because that's worse.
Everything you are doing is embarrassing! That's not getting me on your side.
Well, I don't like all that crazy yelling you guys do at my games! And that song, I hate that stupid First of all, don't talk to me like that.
Second you hate that song? Okay, that's crazy.
That is a beautiful song.
Thank you, Mami.
Alex, you gotta appreciate how these guys support you.
My dad never came to my games.
All he ever did was put me through rehab six times and buy me this building.
Look, all I know is, none of the other parents act like you.
Come on, it's all because we're proud of you, papito.
And stop calling me papito! I'm not a little kid anymore.
My name is Alex, okay? No more papito.
- We'll call you papito.
- I will call you papito.
No.
No! Papito is not an age thing.
We call Conrad "Macho" because when he was four, he sang "Macho Man" once.
We call Francisco "Pepe Popo.
" Figure that out.
I'm called Tata, Lupita, Yoyi.
And my nickname is Pucha.
It is the way of our people! If you don't have a nickname, there's something wrong with you.
- Do I have a nickname? - No.
Anyway, it's a tradition to call you papito, so we're gonna keep doing it, okay, papito? No! You need to stop it and all the embarrassing stuff you guys do at my games.
If you can't, then don't come anymore.
So he meant Tata and Pucha, right? Schnei-Schnei can still go to the games.
You can't give yourself a nickname.
The Amazing Schneider-Man disagrees.
No, we're all still going to the games.
I don't know what's gotten into Alex.
He must be tired.
No, no, Lupita.
I know what this is.
Papito is making the turn.
The turn? From beautiful boy to horrible teenager.
Oh, dear.
Our sweet little Alejandro.
[SIGHS] Where did the tiempo go? RIP, papito.
He's not dead.
Isn't he though? Don't worry.
It's so much easier after they've grown.
You do everything through the lawyers.
It's been rough.
Alex is being really hard on me.
Yeah, well, there's no easy path through it.
Although, if you want some advice Yeah.
Definitely.
Anything.
Whenever possible, treat him like an adult.
If he wants to be called Alex, call him Alex.
Instead of a hug, maybe just try a cool-guy head nod.
'Sup? Maybe he doesn't want to hang out with you as much.
That's okay.
Holding on too tight is not going to keep it from happening.
[CHUCKLES] Your baby boy is turning into a man.
Yeah.
[SIGHS] You're right.
[CHUCKLES] That's great advice, Doc.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
[CRYING] Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [GASPING] I'm sorry! It's just like, what you said, it made it all just hit me.
My baby being gone and turning into a man.
Why'd you say that, Doc? I'm sorry! I was just trying to help! - Don't tell your mother I made you cry.
- [SOBS] I swear it was just yesterday he was a little boy, and I loved it so much.
It was weird how often he kissed me on the lips and asked me to marry him, but now I miss it, you know! You love your kids the same of course, and Elena's amazing, but Alex is just so cool.
And now he doesn't want to hang out with me anymore? I'm sorry.
Next time I ask if you want my advice, just go like [EXCLAIMS] Everybody's leaving me.
Alex will be out of the house, married to his wife with her spray-tanned legs and fake boobs.
I know his type.
And then it'll just be me in my apartment with my mom.
Hey, if I'm lucky, maybe I could take her off your hands.
So I'll just be alone? I'm going to stop talking.
Oh, my God.
He is so cute.
Can I just smell his head for one minute? We're still at lunch.
Thank you.
I know I'm acting crazy.
I just Right now I just want to hold Alex and hug him forever.
[CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? I'm gonna kill that kid.
- It's not that big a deal! - Check your tone.
What happened? His class went on a field trip to the observatory, and he punched a kid from another school.
Papito! Is your hand okay? You know, I've had enough of you and your teen crap.
I'm not raising a jerk.
I'm not a jerk! The other kid's the jerk! Everyone's a jerk! It is still not okay to punch them! Whatever.
You don't understand.
Well, make me understand.
Because how is this okay? Did he hit you first? He was saying stuff! Okay, so what? So what, he called you a name? What? Stupid, dummy, goober? What grade do you think I'm in? Listen, if papito punched somebody, there is a good reason for it.
Did he prevent you from seeing the Jupiter exhibit? Because that thing is amazing.
Was it about a woman? It's okay if it was about a woman.
No, Mami, it's not.
He said, "Go back to Mexico!" So, this was just some random kid? Yeah.
Hugo and I were talking in Spanish, and the kid walked by with his friends and heard us and said it.
And, I don't know, I just lost it.
Okay.
This is not okay.
I'm gonna call the school and straighten this out.
There's nothing you can do.
None of the teachers even saw him say it.
Then after I hit him, Sister Barbara pulled me aside and him and his friends took off.
Alex, we're gonna figure this out, but you can't hit somebody every time they call you a name.
I don't! It was just this time! - Wait, this has happened before? - Yeah.
What did they say? You know, beaner, wetback, gangbanger, Pitbull.
Pitbull's the only one that's even close to accurate! Does this happen at school? No.
Just a couple of times when I'm out.
Once at a baseball game, the other team was leaving on their bus and they saw me and yelled, "Build the wall.
" Oh, my God.
It's so stupid! Whatever.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
No, Mami, let's give him a minute.
Well, we gotta do something.
This is racist! Should we call the police? Wait, the army! No! Oprah! She'll know what to do.
Gracias for your anger, Schneider.
It is adorable.
[SCOFFS] I mean, what the hell? This is America! Yeah, this is America.
And unfortunately, this stuff happens here.
Not to you, but it happens.
Well, I know it happens.
I'm a very aware Canadian-x person.
I know racism's a thing, but we live in LA.
It doesn't happen here.
And now that I've said that out loud, I wish I hadn't.
Yeah, because it happens here.
Yeah, maybe just a dirty look or someone saying, "Keep your voice down," which we all know is code for "Latinos are too loud.
" It's called passion! Turn it down, Mami.
Man, I feel for Alex.
You know, I get how this stuff builds up.
Finally, you say, "Not today!" But nobody saw the other 100 times this crap happened.
They just see the one time you lose it.
Yeah, and ever since somebody decided to call an entire group of Latinos rapists and criminals, everyone thinks they can say whatever racist thought occurs to them.
So what, we're going backwards? That's it, tomorrow I'm getting on Twitter and putting a stop to all of this.
Most of it is so stupid.
People lump us all together.
I mean "beaner"? It's more of a Mexican slur.
Yes! How dare they call us Mexican! Not what we're mad about, Mami.
I've been called a beaner, and I think it's a compliment, 'cause Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, we all have pretty good beans.
No, no, Cubans have the best beans.
We are the true beaners! Not what we're mad about, Mami.
- Know what word makes me see red? Lazy.
- Oh Yeah, that just brings up "siesta" and "you people don't want to work hard.
" Yeah, I mean, either we're taking all your jobs or we're lazy.
Pick one! Thank you.
By the way, get a job.
[EXHALES] I get it.
[CLEARS THROAT, CLICKS TONGUE] There's a word people sometimes call me, too.
- Clueless? - Moocher? Trust fund man-child baby? I'll say it! The word is "white.
" I see it stunned you all into silence.
But you hear how it sounds? It's just dripping with privileged, rich, pale, uncool, bad dancer, Maroon Five fan which is crazy 'cause Maroon Five is the best! Sorry.
I don't know where these stereotypes come from.
Well, I have been called the worst thing that a person could ever be called.
Mami, what was it? The A-word? - The B-word? - [WHISPERS] The C-word? What? No, what are those words? No, no, no, no, no.
This word is so bad that I can hardly bring myself to say it.
- Okay.
- I will say it.
For educational purposes the word is Schneider, can you stand next to me, 'cause I am going to faint.
- Mami, don't say it.
- No, no, no, I am going to say it! The most terrible word in the world! [INHALES DEEPLY] Okay.
Here we go.
And the word is - Can I have a glass of - Mami, just say it! Spic! [GASPS] [PANTS] What? Did you not hear me say spic? - Yeah.
- [SCHNEIDER] We heard you.
No, Mami, that is definitely a bad slur.
But, you know what's weird? - You don't really hear that one anymore.
- I don't think I've ever heard it.
- What is it again? - Spic.
[EXCLAIMS] I'm sorry, Mami.
That one just has more power with your generation.
Well When it is being yelled at you as you are walking home from school, a teenage girl who can barely speak the language, you are thinking first, "It is a cat call.
Because of my perfect legs.
" But then, your friend Valentina tells you, "No, no.
In fact, it is a hate word.
" And then suddenly, you feel very alone.
[SHAKILY] And it stays here.
- [SIGHS DEEPLY] - Mami, I'm sorry.
- Words can be very powerful.
- [SNIFFLES] Yeah, I mean, I feel really bad for Alex.
It's amazing how lucky I've been.
Even these days, in this openly racist world, I've managed to never have an incident.
- What? - No, and hopefully you never will.
Yeah, but why are you being weird? I'm not being weird.
All right, look Um you and your brother are of different shades.
Yes.
Papito is a beautiful caramel and you are Wonder Bread.
- Am I passing? - No! Well What do you mean "passing"? It's when people of color pass as Caucasian and benefit from white privilege even though they're a minority.
Well, that's a big old sÃ­ then, seÃ±orita.
Huh? Let me explain.
[CLEARS THROAT] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH AND CHUCKLING] [LAUGHS] - Yeah! Schneider! I didn't know you could speak Spanish! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] This is terrible! I can't be passing! I am a proud Latinx! What the hell is a Latinx? Is it a Cuban Kleenex? If so, then it is the best Kleenex! I mean, who even decides what Latinx looks like? I look Latinx! Of course you do! You're beautiful! I always thought you looked like Anne Hathaway.
No, no, no! Why are you so mad? Cubans are white.
[GROANS] Mami, Cubans are everything.
But we are mostly descended from white Spaniards.
How many Cubans do we know who are black? And how many Cubans do we know who are blond? [LAUGHS] [WHISPERS] A lot of them.
Saying we're white, brown, black, that's beside the point.
Exactly.
[WHISPERS] We are white.
I can't believe this.
You're saying I'm going to go through my whole life without being oppressed at all? Okay, you know that wouldn't be a bad thing, right? Yeah, I guess.
Hey, you're still gay.
Yes! That's right! And a woman! I'm back in! Oppression is not the goal here, okay? We want peace, equality and most of all, no crappy kid yelling racist stuff at my son while he's trying to learn about stars.
Someone told Alex to go back to another country, as though he doesn't belong in this one.
Do you know how screwed up that is for a 13-year-old boy? I don't even know what to tell him.
Oh [SIGHS] - I want to learn more Spanish.
- I'll set up a lesson plan.
Not from you! Will you teach me, Abuelita? Gracias a Dios.
I knew this day would come.
Oh, wait, can you teach me, too? Of course! And when I am done, you both can pass as Cubans.
- Yay! - Hey! Hey, you.
I'm sorry I hit that kid.
I know.
And I'm sorry all this stuff is happening.
I just want to go back to the way it was.
It's like all of a sudden I'm different? I don't want to be different.
Wait is that why you don't want us to come to the games? So it's not because we're crazy and treat you like a baby? Well, I don't love that.
But, mostly it's because we're too Cuban, right? I mean, I'm proud of being Cuban, but yeah.
- Sorry.
- [CHUCKLES] It's okay.
I get it.
And look, I wish I could say what happened to you today will never happen again, but it might.
'Cause there are a lot of jerks out there, and I don't know if it's worse now or not, but I know I would never want you to change who you are because of them.
And who you are is Cuban and American and mostly a sweet kid who doesn't hurt people.
You can't control the jerks but you can control your reaction to them.
Because this is your country, too, and you deserve to be happy in it.
But if you get angry, they win.
Okay.
[SNIFFLES] [SNIFFS] Actually, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
There is one thing that completely stops the effects of racism.
- You're right, Mom.
I feel only peace.
- [CHUCKLES] Alex, you have something on your chin.
You need a Latinx.
Elena, what did you get? Vanilla? No! But I was able to do my whole order in Spanish! - Hey! Nice.
- Hey! Dale, blanquita, dale.
Ah-ah-ah.
[ALL] Dale, blanquita, dale.
- No! Don't call me blanquita! - Hey, you've got a nickname! Oh, yeah! [LAUGHS] - [ALL] Dale, blanquita, dale! - [EXCLAIMS] - Dale, blanquita, dale! - Excuse me! I know you're having a little fiesta over here, but you should learn to keep your voice down.
There are other people in here.
Mami, would you hold my helado, please.
Hi.
I'm the lady from the table over there.
And I am the lady's mother.
Not her sister.
Question.
Are you the owner of this establishment? - No.
- So then you must know that we have just as much a right to be here as you.
You were being very loud.
Yeah, I noticed you used the word fiesta.
Would you care to comment on that? - Poor choice of words maybe but - Yes, I agree.
Yeah.
It was a very poor choice of words.
You know what else was a poor choice of words? The other words you said to me and my family.
Because this isn't a library.
We were over there having a nice time, but for some reason, you decided that meant I was all, "Arriba! Arriba! Arriba!" That's not me.
How dare you stereotype us! I was born right here, in this country.
I'm an American.
Cuban-American.
And we come in all shapes, sizes and colors.
Mostly white.
And sometimes we can be a little racist, too.
Which is why we should all be free to enjoy the rich diversity of this great nation.
Now you and your wife have a good night.
Still think you should keep your voice down.
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah, well, agree to disagree, sir! - That was awesome, Mom.
- [EXHALES DEEPLY] You see, if you get angry, they win.
If you never get angry, they also win.
It's complicated.
The point is, I didn't hit anybody, and we all got ice cream.
All right, let's get out of here.
Dale, Lupita, dale.
[ALL] Dale, Lupita, dale.
- [PENELOPE] Thank you.
- [LYDIA WHOOPS] [ALL] Dale, Lupita, dale.
And in case anybody else wants to know what's up? This Latin-American family is headed to their American home.
That is so cool.
Anne Hathaway just totally stood up for those Mexicans.
 [LATIN MUSIC PLAYING] - Mami! - [SCREAMS, PANTING] Mami, where's my biology textbook? I was studying, then I fell asleep for two seconds, and it was gone.
Does it have a tree and an Earth - and the lightning? - Yes! - It's in your hand.
- Oh! [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
I need it to study for my stupid test on Tuesday.
Wait, wait, wait, what day is it? I showered on Thursday, so today must be [SNIFFS] Monday.
[GROANS] Mami! I have so much to put in my brain before tomorrow.
Why? Why does a nurse practitioner have to know about the life cycle of plants? I'm not trying to give CPR to a carrot! And we're out of coffee! And I don't have time to go shopping, because after work, I'll probably have to drive Elena to another one of her gay protests.
I'm not trying to be insulting but a lot of them are about gay stuff.
And then, after my test, I have to take papito to his cello lesson.
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we pay his cello teacher? Because she sent me three e-mails, and now I'm not sure what we owe.
I don't trust that lady, Ma.
She never blinks.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Okay, come on, everybody, let's go! Oh, that bath really woke me up.
It started off as a shower, but then I fell asleep.
I even managed to shave one leg.
I'm coming for you next, lefty.
What, what is this? When I said take the trash out, I meant out of the apartment, not out of the can.
Maybe you can show me for next time.
Maybe I can give your PlayStation to Goodwill.
I don't have time to argue, all right? Let's go.
Elena! Man, you guys are moving slower than phosphorous through biomass! - Yes! - Oh! Did you make the appointment to get my braces off? - [GROANS] - You said you'd do it two weeks ago.
Just eat a lot of taffy, they'll come off on their own.
Mom, please.
All right, all right.
Let me put it on the to-do list.
Mom, after school can you drive me to march with the Lesbians Against Fracking? I'm sorry, baby, there's no way.
There's no way that's a real thing.
Queer women don't like our tap water catching fire any more than anyone else does.
It really matters! I know, baby, but so did the Women's March, the Immigration March, the Science March Ay, listen to your mother.
This is march madness! You know, I did like the Women's March.
I looked very nice in that pink pussycat hat.
That's right.
And we really showed the patriarchy that men can no longer strut around with zero self-awareness, and shove their masculinity in our faces.
Hey, guys.
Schneider, would you please knock my eyes out.
What the hell are you wearing? Oh, this? Yeah, it's my new work uniform.
You're hired.
Oh, Lydia, I was actually inspired by you teaching dance to become an educator myself.
I started teaching spinning.
[CHUCKLES] Isn't spinning riding a stationary bike? Why are you wearing a helmet? It's for my own protection.
I may have fallen off a few times.
Anyway, can you post these flyers for me on campus? Oh! Are you too busy? Slammed.
I barely have time to meditate before my sunset hike.
"Murder Schneider.
" - Come on, let's go.
- Wait, I don't have my lunch.
- I don't either.
- [GASPS] Ay! Papito, lo siento! I forgot.
What about me? I was just so distracted with my dance class.
You're teaching ballet to 5-year-olds.
What do you have to prepare for? Disappointment.
Those kids are terrible.
Wait, here, here.
Here is your lunch.
Here you go.
Why does she get 10 bucks and I get 5? Take out the freakin' trash.
Let's go.
I'm sorry, I know I'm late.
Well, no.
Actually, it's 8:00 a.
m.
on the dot.
[BOTH] Early is on time.
On time is late.
Sorry, my personal motto isn't, "That's what she said.
" Hey.
My personal motto is, "Swipe right on life.
" So school's really keeping you busy, huh? Yeah, when are you gonna hook me up with some hot coeds? Or are they all returning students? Uh you mean people who are gonna be your boss soon? Yeah, I don't think that's how it works.
Oh, that's exactly how it works, Scott! I'm gonna go do my job.
Make me coffee 'cause I'm gonna be your boss? Yeah, you go do that.
That's what she said! What's wrong? Are you okay? Hey, someone call the doctor! I'm just so worn out.
I got school on top of everything else.
It's got Mama beat.
[SIGHS] I must look like hell.
- You have been looking - Mama don't need to hear that, Doc.
Well, I know where you're coming from.
I don't do very much and Daddy's been exhausted for the last 35 years.
Yeah, let's not keep doing that Mama-Daddy thing.
Can I confess something to you, Doc? Yeah.
[SIGHS] School is hard! I got good grades in high school, but that was my mom.
She used to stand over me while I studied, and if I nodded off, she'd squirt me with a spray bottle.
She sprays me, too.
With cologne.
Says I'm not a man unless I smell like the inside of a boot.
This whole nurse practitioner thing is a real game changer for my whole family.
There's a lot of pressure, and honestly, it is kicking my butt.
And then the professor thanked me for correcting her and the whole class applauded.
[SCOTT GROANS] We get it! I'm sorry.
One of the only joys I have is making sure he knows I am better than him.
You are, girlfriend.
You are Superwoman.
Hear you roar.
You go, girl.
Doc, can I confess something else about school? [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] I'm kind of failing.
[LAUGHS] Right! You failing? I can see that.
"I got an A-minus, oy! Dios mÃ­o.
" Look.
All I know is, I believe in you.
Which is why I've already leased the office next door so we can expand the practice to accommodate all the new patients that you are going to be bringing in.
Surprise! What? That's the face I was looking for! [GASPS] I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, I'm putting all my eggs in Mama's basket.
There's no going back now! Literally, the future of this office rests on these shoulders.
[CHUCKLES] Boy, you are tight.
Alex - [BALLET MUSIC PLAYING] - And chins up, and shoulders back.
ChassÃ©, chassÃ©, chaÃ®nÃ© turn.
Oh, that is so good.
[LAUGHS] Hopeless.
I really need to study.
What happened to finding a space at the church? I would never put God through this.
Everything is very expensive, so I'm going to wait until after you graduate and you get your big raise.
Sasha, no biting! That one is going to make it.
Okay, snack time, children.
Look at them, so excited about food.
They will never be dancers.
Where's Alex? In my room, practicing the cello.
Oh, hey.
Oh, yeah.
No, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no.
That's my work space.
- Sorry, Mom, I really need the table.
- For what? 'Cause this ain't homework.
I'm planning on starting a GSA at school.
A Gay-Straight Alliance.
Are you gay? I forgot because you haven't mentioned it in the last five minutes.
Papito, trash, cello, then making fun of your sister.
Anyway I'm expecting a big pushback from the Catholic school administration.
I'm getting a jump on the protest.
And I've been practicing my angry, staring-down-nuns look.
That's more a "someone at the office stole my yogurt" face, but you keep working on it.
Not here.
I don't understand why do you need a gay club.
We get it.
You're here, you're queer, we're used to it.
Move on! Abuelita, what if someone told you not to talk about being Cuban? I would kick them in the aguacates, why do you ask? Mami, did you make my braces appointment yet? No, I didn't.
Mom, have you seen that Can everyone just get off my back and do what you're supposed to be doing? - Oh, chill out.
- Jeez.
Mom, why are you so uptight? I'm sorry.
But I'm working my sweet nalguitas off, and you guys should be, too! That's why I'm at the top of my class! I'm just being real with you! CÃ¡lmate, niÃ±a.
[SCOFFS] "Calm down"? Are you the same woman who broke out the chancleta while I was memorizing the states? - 'Cause I'll never be able to forget it.
- You hit Mami with your chancleta? Oh, please, I would never.
It's just a learning tool.
It's all about the sound.
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona! Okay, put that away! [SIGHS] Everybody, go do your work so I can do mine.
No interruptions.
Let's go dance some more! Okay.
ChassÃ©.
Who can do a chassÃ©? And who can do a beautiful leap like a deer? Who can do that? Who can do a chaÃ®nÃ©? Oh! That is so beautiful! Dance with your hearts.
Dance with your souls.
Thank you for letting me study here.
It's so peaceful.
You don't realize how much noise there is until there is no noise.
- Yeah, it's kinda - [SHUSHES] I have a huge test tomorrow.
I really need you to let me work, okay? I get it.
[CHUCKLES] I got work, too.
[CLEARS THROAT] See, the key to effective spinning is a great music playlist.
This one I'm working on right now is tiger-themed.
So far I've got "Eye Of The Tiger" and that Katy Perry song where she says, "Eye of the tiger.
" - You wanna hear my playlist? - Shut up! Okay.
[SCOFFS] I guess it's suddenly cool to walk into somebody else's apartment and treat it like it's your own.
[SOBS] [SIGHS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Hey.
What? What's up with the spin stuff? Okay, I decided to take a break from dating.
See, I realized that women were just another one of my addictions, like alcohol, drugs, gambling, cigarettes, snow globes.
Snow globes? Is that like a drug thing? [CHUCKLES] Wow! [GASPS] Is this one of our family? Hey, you should probably get back to studying.
The point is, I've broken the cycle of addiction with spinning.
Five hours a day, every single day.
I have to do it! Yeah, you don't sound addicted at all.
Get off my back! [CLICKS TONGUE] I'm sorry, I'm just [SIGHS] I'm having so much trouble focusing.
I just can't seem to hold information in my head anymore.
You know what might help you? - Do not say spinning.
- Spinning! Stay with me.
I have found that it actually helps me retain information a lot better.
No disrespect, but I don't need to take advice from you.
- ["WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU" PLAYING] - Hey! Uh-huh Hey! Oh, my God! This is amazing! Plus, it's the perfect substitute for dating, 'cause it burns a lot of energy and also numbs my junk! All right! Get up out of the saddle! [WHOOPS AND EXCLAIMS] Homeostasis is the process of maintaining a relatively constant internal environment despite changes in the external environment! Yeah! - [SCHNEIDER GRUNTS] - [THUDS] I'm okay.
This is why I wear the helmet.
[CELLO PLAYING] Oh, papito.
If Yo-Yo Ma heard you play, he would quit.
Yeah, he would.
All right! Test is done.
And tonight, I'm shaving my left leg.
What's happening here? Did the school shut down your GSA protest? Worse.
They said yes! They think it would be "a positive influence on the educational community.
" And then they gave me a meeting room and a snack budget! Okay, I'm sleep-deprived, but I think she said happy words in a mad voice? What? Like I'm supposed to believe my Catholic school is suddenly pro-gay? Yeah, nice try! You know, I think being a lesbian has made you very angry.
That is such a stereotype! Is it? Well, I have a lot to be angry about.
Climate change, sexism, racism, there's a lot of bad things happening! Elena, what is going on? Usually when you win, you're insufferable.
You even have that dance you do.
[GRUNTING] You got that I don't know what it is, but right now, I miss it.
Whatever.
There's still plenty of people out there who hate that I'm gay.
Honey, I know that.
But society's changing.
People are more accepting than ever.
[SOFTLY] Yeah, not everybody.
Maybe not one person in particular? [SCOFFS] You mean my father, who's not even as progressive as the Catholic church? So that's what this is about.
I just thought it'd get easier but it still sucks.
I know, mija.
I just I haven't gotten a call, or an e-mail It's been three months.
I just thought he'd be sorry by now, but maybe he never will be.
I had no idea you were feeling this way.
I am sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's just hard because I want to hate him but he's still my dad.
Oh, baby.
You know, not to brag but I have some experience being angry with your papi.
You have to trust me.
It doesn't hurt him, it only hurts you.
So you need to celebrate all the good things happening in your life, yeah? Yeah.
So why don't we try this again? You got the GSA.
What? The GSA! With a snack budget and a meeting room.
Come on! Come Yeah! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! I don't know what that is, but I'm glad to see it.
[BOTH LAUGH] Hey, do you guys have an ice pack? I may have overspun.
I'll get it.
Here, here, here, here.
Oh, my God.
[GROANS] Hey, did you get your test score yet? - It's after 5:00! - [EXCLAIMS] [PENELOPE] They probably posted it.
Schneider, why don't you lay down, huh? Okay? - [GROANS] - Yeah.
- Uh - [SIGHS] You do it.
Come on! What is it? Don't tell me that you did so much better than the rest of the class that they are now cyberbullying you? No, Mami.
I did bad.
I did really bad.
You don't do bad.
You're always killing it.
We know because you always say, "I'm killing it.
" This is all my fault.
You needed to do real studying, and I distracted you with my spinning and beautiful globes.
No, I did study.
[SIGHS] I tried really hard and I still didn't do good.
Do "well.
" Sorry.
It's just one test, Mom.
You'll do better next time.
[CHUCKLES] That's the thing.
75? - [ELENA GASPS] - [LYDIA GROANS] 68? [INHALES SHARPLY] 62! I would faint, but I don't want a below-average nurse to help me.
Mom, maybe you just need to study more.
No, that's not it.
It's me.
I can't do it.
Of course you can! [ALL TALKING] No, Mami, I can't! I obviously can't! I'm sorry.
I let you all down, and I really wanted to do this for all of us.
But I think it's time to admit it, that I tried, and I failed.
And now I think it's time to quit.
What? Really? Mom, this is your dream.
Yes.
But this is this is also my dream.
You know, a great family.
I already have a great job.
When you add school on top of it, it's like I'm trying to do three things great, but I'm just doing them all badly.
So I think this is the right decision, and I think it's time to quit.
Okay.
[INHALES DEEPLY] - I can go back to showering every day.
- [ALL CHUCKLE] I can take you to protest so you can yell at people.
We can yell together.
Oh, that's gonna be great, because you're so loud! This is great.
This is gonna be great.
Who knows, maybe after a couple years, when you guys are out of the house, and it's not so crazy, maybe I can tackle school again.
Yeah.
Sure.
Oh, my God, you guys You guys do you know what I'm gonna do tomorrow morning? I'm gonna sleep till 6:30 in the morning! - [LYDIA] Whoa! - [ALL CHUCKLING] Aw Keep it going.
I'll get there.
No.
Fire in the junkyard.
Lupita.
Carlos, it undoes in the front.
- Get up! - What the Mami! [PANTING] It's 4:30 in the morning.
I know, sweetheart.
Dale! - What's happening? - You'll see, you'll see, ya verÃ¡s.
- Ta-da! - Ah! Okay, this is nice.
What is this? We decided you're staying in school.
No, no.
No, remember, I failed.
I'm a quitter, it's fine.
Ma! Lupita, after you went to bed last night, none of us could sleep.
We realized we were being selfish.
You didn't fail, Mom, you just can't do it alone.
That's right! You know, you don't have to be a super woman! There can only be one such woman in a family, and that is me.
So we're all going to pitch in and help you make your dream come true.
I'll take out the trash, pack my own lunch And I am going to skip the Queer Women March Against Nukes to help you.
- What's your preferred study method? - Coffee and tears.
You are a disaster! I can fix you.
If this is what you want.
I do.
Then you got this.
And we got you.
And I will be here for you, mi amor.
[CHUCKLES] Oh! I see you found your Okay! No more talk! A estudiar! Can you guys keep it down? Schneider, why are you still here? I can't feel my legs.
I might be here for another day or two.
Oh It's the scene from my snow globe.
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [ELENA] This is gonna be good.
Sounds like Alex is home.
No, Mami, that's Elena.
But I hear friends.
Hey, Elena.
Who are all these peeps? What's up, peeps? Okay, so stop saying "peeps.
" Oh, 'cause peeps are candy chicks used to celebrate pagan fertility, and women are more than just baby-makers? I get it.
Maybe don't say anything.
Anyway, this is the advocacy group I was telling you about.
The Feminist Gamers of Echo Park.
We've been hanging out online and this is our first meeting IRL.
Welcome.
What's everybody's name? I'm Dani.
My pronouns are "she" and "her.
" Syd.
My pronouns are "they" and "them.
" I'm Margaux.
Pronouns "ze" and "zir.
" I'm Penelope.
My thoughts are "Huh?" and "What?" Seriously, what is happening? Well, because some people are gender non-conforming, they have preferred pronouns.
Ah! I am Lydia.
Pronouns "Ly-dee-a.
" We're going downtown to protest the release of a new video game.
Blood-splosion Six.
I guess you think it's too violent, huh? No, we love that part.
When you create your avatar, there are only two gender non-binary characters.
And the advertising strongly suggested there would be three.
Okay, just, you know, be careful.
Don't worry.
I'll be watching them.
Why would you be watching Syd? - I meant you.
- My pronoun is "her.
" - I thought she was "her.
" - We're both "her.
" You mean "them.
" No, "they" is "them.
" Stop making this confusing.
'Sup? Ay, papito.
You are barking up so many wrong trees.
I love all the activism, but make sure it doesn't affect your homework.
- Because - I need to - build up my transcript.
- Build up your transcript.
- And crush the PSATs! - And crush the PSATs! Wha Yes! That's my girl! Okay, everybody! When we get there, she takes her team to the stairs, ze takes zir team to the parking lot, and they take their team to the corner.
He, she, they, and ze will all meet up at the fair-trade coffee shop - between the two Starbucks.
Got it? - [ALL] Got it! [MARGAUX] Let's march! She must have practiced that.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] We got a stabilized GSW.
Start one liter normal saline bolus wide open, prep room two.
Page a trauma team.
Hey! I say all that.
I'm sorry.
Nurse practitioner in training.
It's my first day.
I'm a little nervous.
Don't let it happen again.
Do everything she just said.
Penelope Alvarez? Oh, my God.
Max Ferraro? Oh, my God! Oh! I I can't believe you're here! The last time I saw you was in Kabul, right? Yeah, at the field hospital! The one where they turned the mess hall into a salsa club on Thursday nights.
Yeah, that's right.
The Kabul Cabana! - [CHUCKLES] - Have you always been this tall? You haven't seen me in a while.
Had a growth spurt at 40.
[BOTH LAUGH] - It's great to see you! - Yeah! So, how are ya? How's Victor? Uh, Victor, he, um We're divorced.
[CHUCKLES] He's in Afghanistan doing the contractor thing.
How's Amber? She's in Altadena, doing our contractor.
Anyway, we're divorced.
[BOTH LAUGH] - Sorry to hear that.
[CHUCKLES] - Yeah, same.
We should, um, get together after work sometime, catch up.
[CHUCKLES] Uh Look, I'm gonna be real with you because you are cute.
[CHUCKLES] Uh It's not gonna happen, you know.
Between work, my two kids, and school, I don't have any free time.
Until I graduate, this is my social life.
Nurse Alvarez.
We need you to deal with that anorectal abscess.
Saturday night came early! [CHUCKLES] I gotta go drain a butt.
Here you go, Lydia.
A little gift to grab those hard-to-reach items.
Magnificent! Wow.
So when I get older, will I be easily amazed, too? Hush, papito.
- [CHUCKLES] Leslie has been so helpful! - [CHUCKLES] That's true.
Now Abuelita won't need you to come over and get jars down from the top shelf.
Whoops.
- [LAUGHING] My gosh! - So how did it go? Amazing! [LAUGHS] We delivered a powerful message and we were heard.
[CHUCKLES] Dani was, honestly, inspirational.
So you got them to change the video game? No.
There was no one in the building because it's Saturday.
A security guard said if we came back next week, we can tour the building and get T-shirts.
And we will wear them ironically! Yay, us! [LAUGHS] This calls for celebration.
Why don't I cook some food for your friends? Great idea! Do you guys want to stay for dinner? - Sure.
- Oh, you guys have fun, but I gotta go.
So everybody should probably go.
[CHUCKLES] - We can meet up next week.
- Yeah.
Bye! - [DANI] Bye.
- [MARGAUX] Bye.
What a nice group of human people friends.
I heard about the pronoun thing.
Now I'm terrified to speak.
Why are you smiling? I think somebody has a crush on "her.
" Dani? No, I don't! I don't even know her! You have a crush on her! [LAUGHS] No, no, no.
When it comes to detecting romance, I am like cousin Aurensio at the beach with his metal detector.
So you found nothing and you're sweating through your shirt? Don't be bashful.
I think it is fantastic to be young and in love and to flirt.
And by the way, I can teach you things because your flirting is de madre.
I wasn't flirting.
And we're not talking about this.
Besides, Mom says I'm too young to date.
But never too young to flirt.
When I came out of my mother's womb, I winked at the doctor! I guess you always had a thing for doctors, huh? Eh, I got over it.
I will teach you to flirt.
If they say something clever, laugh loudly, throw your head back, and reveal your perfect neck.
[LAUGHING] I'm a fan of the specific compliment.
I really like your shirt.
It's a great color on you.
Â¡Gracias, papito! [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] Will you two stop flirting with each other? It's beyond creepy! Oh, welcome home! We are flirting! QuÃ© fun! Ma, when are you not flirting? Are you doing your famous [IMITATES LYDIA LAUGHING] Classic.
That's how I get pork loin at half price.
- Wait, what's going on? - Elena has a crush.
A crush? Uh-uh.
No.
I don't need to remind you that while you're in school, there is no time for dating.
Lupe, don't crush her crush.
[SCOFFS] You're the one who taught me this! You and Papi constantly made me focus on school.
And I hated it, too, but it ended up being a good thing.
And now I pass the annoyance on to you.
Elena, I'm sorry, but you can't date.
- Fine, can we be done now? - Look, people get crushes.
Maybe you see this person and instantly your knees get weak and your brain starts to melt, and you think maybe I'm not dead inside.
Why did I wear granny panties today? You can't think of anything else because you want them so much.
Well, too bad! We shut that crush down! Because we don't let anything get in the way of our education.
Even maldito crystal blue eyes! Oh, you are so strict.
And very specific.
I don't care.
School comes first, dating comes never.
Okay, whatever! Ay, Lupita, Elena can't help it if she has feelings.
Besides, flirting can be fun, and it doesn't hurt anyone.
[MEOWS] Hey, there.
Did you get through your second day okay? Yep.
How'd all that butt stuff go? You mean, was I successful in satisfying the requirements for my clinical studies? I was.
Okay.
You, uh, heading home? No, I'm going to the club.
Why are you being mean? I don't know.
[BOTH EXHALE] [WHISPERS] Oh, my God.
Por el amor de Dios.
Yeah, I liked it too.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Oh, my God, I did a bad thing.
I mean, it was good.
It was real good.
But bad, bad.
It was such a huge mistake! Oh, I've seen this before.
[CLEARS THROAT] Sex, drugs, or Cheesecake Factory? I met a guy at work, and I slept with him.
What is that, like a Make-A-Wish thing? No! What? No! But it was wrong! And I'm freaking out! Okay, okay, okay, come here, come here.
Just sit down.
Just walk me through what happened.
Paramedic I knew from way back.
I mean, he's He's a really good guy.
- But I don't know him well enough - Yeah.
I'm not interested in the boring history of your friendship.
I was thinking more, "We met in the ER.
- He gave me ten ccs of hot" - No, I'm serious, Schneider! I have never I've never done anything like this before.
I have a strict seven-date policy.
Well, this is the second guy you've hooked up with in 20 years.
Maybe it's time to update that policy.
Dating has changed since the 1800s.
Guilt, shame, and regret are things of the past.
Be sex-positive, girl.
I'm a mother.
I'm sex negative.
I'm dating a mother.
You know her.
Nikki.
Finn's mom? - Yeah! - Ugh.
- Hello, Penelope.
- Hey, hi! Oh, my God! [CHUCKLES] I didn't mean anything.
Oh, please.
My self-esteem is bulletproof.
Obviously.
I was just telling Pene about our sitch.
Oh, yeah, it's great.
I come over, tell him to do stuff to me, he does it, I go home.
You should get one.
Oh, no, no, no.
That is okay.
I think what Nikki was kinda dancing around is that you don't always have to have a relationship with a capital "R.
" Sometimes all you need is what the great poets of the Renaissance called a junk buddy.
Exactly.
You don't even have to like them.
Hands.
Ah, see, I don't want that.
I can't have sex without love.
Oh.
That's so sad.
So, are you gonna ask Dani out? What? No.
It's just complicated, okay? I get it.
You don't have a crush on Dani and you don't want to talk about it.
Okay, I do have a crush! I do, I do, I do! Whoa! Act like you've been there.
I haven't been there! The pool of local lesbians my age is not that big.
They could all fit in one pool.
Be a pretty sweet pool.
I just I assumed that coming out was going to be the difficult part, but now that I like someone, I just I don't know if Dani's gay.
What if she's not? I don't want to be the gay girl that asks out a straight girl.
That's such a trope.
Huh.
Gay dating sounds tricky.
I just toss out a couple of "sups," and see who responds.
Being a straight dude is the best.
What I'm really afraid of is that I'll ask Dani out and she'll give me one of those "Oh" - What does that mean? - It means, "I'm not gay and you think I am and now we have a situation.
" You got all that from, "Oh?" I'm just scared.
What if she runs away or something? So instead, you are running away! Abuelita! Can't a girl have a moment of privacy? I live behind a curtain.
When are you going to understand this? Elena, love must be bold.
Well, I'm not sure I should be bold.
I've been told, by more than a few people, that I'm "a lot.
" Who? Mostly you.
It's always been easy for you guys.
What if no one ever likes me? Ah.
Well, it has not always been easy for me.
What? Havana, 1958, I was madly in love with a young boy from the country, Flavio.
We were both 14.
And he looked so majestic on that tractor, with a cigar dangling from his lips.
And I, looking ravishing with a cigar dangling from my lips.
And one day I decided to let him know of my feelings.
And he laughed and he drove away.
That's terrible.
Oh, I was devastated.
I salted the soil with my tears and a beautiful rose grew there.
- Really? - It's a metaphor.
But yes, really.
And as I walked home, I heard the healing sounds of the mambo and I followed my ears to this little dance hall.
And there is where I met Berto.
So you're saying you never would have met Abuelito if you hadn't put yourself out there and been rejected by Flavio? Exactly! Because in love, you have to make yourself vulnerable.
But it's just really hard.
No.
No, mira, this is what you do.
You offer Dani a cookie.
And if she doesn't want it, then it'll be like she's rejecting the cookie, and not you.
And for God's sake, who wants to be with somebody who doesn't even want a cookie? Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
I mean, it beats what I've been doing.
Just staring awkwardly and smelling her hair as she walks by.
You could do better.
[BREATHES DEEPLY] Thanks, Abuelita.
That was really nice of you to tell her that story, Abuelita.
Mentiras.
That was my sister Maruchi's story, and you know what? Frankly, I'm a little insulted that you both believe that happened to me.
- Hey! - Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
I was hoping I could bump into you.
- [CHUCKLES] - Can I buy you dinner? Sun Chips? Funyuns? A single $6 Aspirin? God, they gouge you here.
No, thanks.
[CHUCKLES] Then how about I take you out on a real date? Somewhere classy, where they make you pay for water.
Listen, Max.
What happened last night, that's not me.
I mean, it was me.
I don't have, like, a really sexy twin.
[CHUCKLES] But, um I don't normally do that.
Let's go back to this twin thing.
I'm serious.
So am I! That was a first for me.
I'm actually pretty old-fashioned.
[SCOFFS] Yeah, right! Look at you.
You're telling me you never jumped into bed with some cute little car crash victim? Traffic accidents aren't the hook-up spots you think they are.
Actually, when Amber and I broke up, it hit me like a ton of bricks.
But, you know, after that, I kind of threw myself into work.
Look, last night was great.
Even though we rushed into it I've had a crush on you for like 15 years.
Shut up! Yeah, no, it can never happen again.
Why not? [STUTTERS] I get, like, little chunks of 45 minutes here and there.
And I want more than a junk buddy.
"Junk buddy"? Yeah, it's a thing.
Or maybe it's not a thing.
I gotta be honest, I've got some real idiots giving me advice.
It sounds like it.
Oh.
All right.
We've got a problem.
'Cause I like you.
But I don't want to do the hook-up thing, and I don't have time for the romantic thing.
So what do we do? [BOTH EXHALE] I need a nap.
Oh, damn, that was good.
We ate an entire pizza in 17 minutes.
And we managed to tell two embarrassing stories from high school.
I'm not sure going to all four senior proms counts as embarrassing.
- But this was fun.
- [LAUGHS] - [SIGHS] - Hey, come on, come on.
Is this crazy? No! I mean, it's not ideal, but it's better than sitting in the back of an ambulance, eating chili.
Oh, pobrecito.
That is so sad.
Well, it's an ambulance, so I usually have company.
I guess that's still sad.
[PENELOPE SIGHS] So you'd really be okay with just 45 minutes a week? With you? I will take what I can get.
Okay, but we have to keep this a secret 'cause there's no way I can explain to my mom and kids what this is.
I'm gonna tell all my friends 'cause they'll get it.
That's cool with me.
[BOTH LAUGHING] - [MAX SIGHS] - Mmm.
Okay.
My kids will be home in 25 minutes.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get there.
So what I'm hearing is we got five minutes.
Lucky for you, I can do a lot in five minutes.
I love these unisex shirts.
Could use more blood though.
[SNIFFS AND SIGHS] Are you looking to get your courage up? Do you want a little rum? No! I don't even want to talk to her until I know for sure that she's gay.
Mmm.
Wait, what are you doing? Excuse me, "she.
" What color lipstick are you wearing? Oh, I don't wear lipstick.
Just ChapStick.
Oh, nice! Gay.
[CELL PHONE BUZZES] Ooh, my girlfriend's out front.
She hates when I make her wait.
And she just bought me a cookie! I love cookies! [CHUCKLES] She has a girlfriend.
She's so lucky.
Hey, uh, do you want to split that cookie? Huh? Wait.
Oh Oh, never mind.
Uh, I thought Sorry.
- Sorry, sorry.
- No, no! Gay! Me, gay! [CHUCKLES] Oh.
Uh, me gay, too.
- That's great.
- [BOTH CHUCKLE] Cookie? Uh Yeah.
She is terrible at this.
Thank goodness she has us.
- Mami, don't get mad - What is it? What did you do? I told you not to get mad! Which is the quickest way to make me mad! Okay, let me start again! So I've been talking to Syd Syd? I thought you liked Dani.
Dani is yesterday's news.
Keep up! Anyway, I started talking to Syd and I found out we have so much in common.
And I know you're not crazy about me dating, but I was just wondering if I could get ice cream with them.
And by "them," you mean just Syd? Yes! [CHUCKLES] I'm at the top of my class, and I finished all my homework, and Yes.
- Yes? - Yes.
But I have seven more reasons why you should let me do this.
Take yes for an answer.
Being a good student is obviously important, but it's not the only thing.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! Yeah.
Of course! It's important to make a little time for romance.
Otherwise, what are we doing? Mm-hmm.
- [SIREN WAILING] - [INHALES DEEPLY AND SIGHS] What? Now you like the sounds of sirens? Just the thought of an ambulance rushing towards a body that needs attention.
You work too hard.
 Oh, man, I really wanted to see you tonight, Max.
My clinical hours got rescheduled, and I'm free.
Squirrel attack? How many people could it have bitten? That many? Mmm.
Oh, no.
No, I just have classes and kid stuff for the rest of the week, but I really wanted to see you because I have an emergency in my - Hey, Mom.
- [STAMMERS] Thank you, Dr.
Berkowitz.
Good work phone call.
Thanks.
Bye.
What's up? I need money.
And I need a margarita, but it's 7:00 in the morning.
Mom, please.
I'm going to a movie.
Okay, papito.
Here.
Ten dollars.
Oh, maybe I wasn't clear.
I'm actually going to a movie in this century.
It's in color and everything.
A ticket costs $9.
50.
And I expect change.
No, I feel your pain.
I never had enough money to go to the movies with friends.
Or enough friends to go to the movies with friends.
Oh, I know, why don't you pluck your one mustache hair, and you can get the kid price? Why don't you pluck your 20 mustache hairs? Joke's on you, because each one of these hairs is a blow to the patriarchy.
Oh, you win.
Come on, Mom.
All my friends get way more cash from their parents.
What have I told you about comparing yourself to other people? To always do it and make sure I'm better.
No, that's your abuelita.
Look, my, uh, clinical hours got all squirrelly.
So I'm gonna take you to the movies and show you how to have fun on a budget.
What? No.
It'll be great.
- It'll be like a date with your mom.
- No! No, no, no.
- Stop.
Oh, my God.
- [KISSING] Come on.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
[CHUCKLES] Ay.
Â¡Ay, ay, ay, ay! Â¡Ay! Oh [GROANING] Well, don't make such a big deal of it.
I'm fine.
What happened? She tripped on the sidewalk in front of the building and hurt her arm.
[GRUNTS] I had to break my fall.
Some people's faces are worth protecting.
Papito knows what I'm talking about.
- Abuelita, how did you trip? - That stupid sidewalk was broken.
The roots of the tree pushed it up.
[GROANS] Man, Mother Nature is turning on us.
And after we've treated her so well.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Okay, I have figured out what to do about that tree.
Form a Million Abuelita March.
That adds up to, like, seven million hard candies.
No, no, no.
I have something better than all that, that will cut through the red tape.
Ha! Ha! - Ha! - Abuelita, be careful! Oh, I know.
I'm sorry.
This is not my usual machete arm.
[LAUGHS] - Ah [EXCLAIMS] - Okay.
Let's just put this back in the machete cozy? Hey, come on.
I just want to chop off the roots of the tree.
There's something less murder-y that might help.
Uh, Proposition U.
You want to proposition me? No.
Proposition, the letter "U.
" It's a ballot measure in next week's local election.
It would pay for infrastructure repairs, including sidewalks.
And there may even be enough money to replace the plastic recycling bins in Echo Park with new recycling bins made out of recycled recycling bins.
That is great.
About the sidewalks getting fixed, not your trash talk.
Okay.
The election is this Tuesday, so make sure you vote "yes" on Prop U.
I would love to, but I don't vote.
[CHUCKLES] What do you mean you don't vote? I mean that on the election day, instead of voting, I don't vote.
[CHUCKLES] But you don't mean you never vote? Like, you voted in the last election? Oh, the last one? No.
And now we have that monster in the White House! Well, don't blame me.
I didn't vote for him! Good for you.
Oh, you will never believe what we just discovered.
Mami, how many times have I told you to give that machete to the Goodwill? Yeah, I don't think a machete is really on brand for them.
No.
We found out Abuelita doesn't vote.
Oh, that? Yeah, I know.
What? How could you let this happen? Voting is the single most important thing we can do as Americans.
Don't yell at me, I know.
I vote every four years like I'm supposed to.
What about primaries, midterm elections, local elections? Yeah, I don't care about that stuff.
I vote in other ways! I take a lot of online quizzes.
Turns out I'm a Hufflepuff.
See, the great thing about having a green card is you get to live here without having to do all the stuff Americans have to, like vote or serve jury duty or become obese.
Okay, but at least you vote in Canadian elections.
Mmm No.
Even in Canada, nothing ever changes.
Clean air, sensible gun control, free health care.
The system's rigged.
Vote, don't vote, it doesn't matter.
We always end up with the same comebolas.
But you're always talking about how this country saved you from a communist dictatorship and how democracy is a gift.
That's true.
God bless the USA.
These colores don't run.
So why don't you vote? It doesn't do anything.
[GRUNTS] Â¡Ay! I mean, I can't wait to turn 18 so that I can vote, and you're wasting yours? She's right, Mami.
This isn't one of those big elections? They're all big elections! They're all big elections, Mami! I mean, sure, some issues are more important than others, but I can think of a thousand reasons Â¡Ay, ay, ay! Okay! You win.
And if you stop talking, I win.
- So you'll do it? - Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I thought this was a democracy.
But this is some kind of dictatorship where people are forced to vote! Ooh, okay.
Let's find three seats.
One for me, one for you, one for the bag of money we're gonna save.
Oh, God.
Those kids are from school.
- You wanna sit with them? - No, no, no, let's stay here.
Hey, guys.
[LAUGHING] Great.
First I have no money, now I have no dignity.
Maybe, but what you do have is What? Where'd these come from? My pockets.
Is that why you're wearing cargo pants? First of all, they were very stylish in the '90s.
Second, it is the key to sneaking food past any by-the-book ushers who might narc on you.
Ba-blam! Licorice.
Where'd you get these? The 99-Cent Store? [SCOFFS] The 98-Cent Store.
Yeah, your mami ain't no chump.
See, we may not be spending a lot of money, but it's lit, right? 5-0! Dust it off.
Five-second rule.
Abuelita, I want to study the election issues with you.
Ugh.
Come on.
I mean, otherwise you'll just be another uninformed voter.
Yeah.
They look so happy.
Yeah.
And who wants to live like that? [CHUCKLES] Anyway, there's a lot of really serious stuff on this ballot.
Um, let's start with Prop T, "Stand Behind Teachers.
" Oh, that's easy, 'cause I love teachers.
I am a teacher.
I will vote "yes" on T.
Oh, good job, Abuelita.
- You just got them all fired.
- [GASPS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SIGHS] A lot of these ballot measures are intentionally misleading.
So, Prop T would replace union teachers with non-union teachers who make half as much.
"Stand Behind Teachers"? More like, "Stand behind them so we can kick them out the door," am I right? Are we done now? No, we're just getting started! There's the school board race, the controller race [GASPS] and a very exciting sewer tax initiative.
Oh.
Did you hear the knock? I think there's somebody at the door.
- I didn't hear anything.
- Coming! Oh! Don't you look pretty? [LAUGHS] I know there's no one out there! Where did you get your hair done? See? Pretty great, right? Nothing keeps popcorn fresher than a shower cap you snagged from a hotel room.
But aren't we breaking the law or something? I don't want to end up in jail.
If the other prisoners ask me what I'm in for and I say "gummy bears," I don't see that ending well.
There is no law against outside food.
There's a rule, but that's totally different.
- It's okay to break the rules? - Absolutely not.
Unless the rule's nuts.
Speaking of nuts Goobers.
They're so warm.
You're welcome.
And we saved eight dollars.
You know how much a box of Goobers costs to make? A penny.
- You really know that or - A penny! I scored these at a gas station on Pico.
Mislabeled at 49 cents! I bought every box.
We're gonna be serving Goobers at your wedding.
I'm good with that.
- You have any soda in your pants? - No.
[SMACKS LIPS] Aw.
Ba-blam! No, no, no.
The usher will hear you.
You have to wait for an explosion.
- [EXPLOSION] - [CANS HISSING] Come on, people, let's go! We gotta get there before the polls close! They close in 11 hours.
I'm excited, okay? I mean, Abuelita's never voted before.
I can't wait for my first time.
And I hope I do it right.
I was really hoping my first time would be with Hillary, but I can picture myself doing it with Elizabeth Warren.
You and me both, sister.
Hey, Mom, if you have time tonight, maybe we can go see another movie? You want to hang out with me again? The movie's R-rated, so I kind of need you.
[CHUCKLES] - But we had fun, right? - Yes, we did.
Abuelita, come on! Where are you? I am right here.
I am so sorry, everybody, but I'm having trouble walking, and I cannot vote today.
Oh, well, maybe next time.
Come on, Abuelita.
I was so looking forward to taking you to vote.
I know, and I am so disappointed to miss it.
Ah! You don't have to.
I have a wheelchair up in my apartment.
I was Stephen Hawking for Halloween.
[IMITATING STEPHEN HAWKING] People were offended.
This is perfect! Abuelita, we can stop to get Schneider's insensitive wheelchair, which I have a lot to say about, just not now, and then we can head to the polls.
- Let's go! - [SCHNEIDER] All right.
Great news! USA! USA! US [LOCK RATTLING] What the hell is happening? Why is she locking us out? - Schneider, I need your key.
- Sure.
Here.
Thank you.
I've been trying to get this away from you for two years.
Nice try.
These are all your apartment.
- Mami! - Abuelita! - Lydia? - Abuelita! - She's probably in the kitchen.
- Abuelita? - [ALEX] Abuelita? - [SCHNEIDER] Lydia? [PENELOPE] Mami! Lydia? Mami? My leg is feeling better.
[SCOFFS] Mami, what's going on? Why are you acting like such a loca? Are you afraid to vote? I mean, is it because in Cuba, any act of political expression was met with violent repercussions? Yeah, sure.
Make that the reason.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Okay.
[SIGHS AND CLEARS THROAT] I don't vote because I am not a citizen.
What? Yes, you are.
You and Papi had your citizenship interviews - while I was deployed in Afghanistan.
- No.
We were supposed to, but we never did.
We ended up spending the whole afternoon in the park together, bird-watching.
Which, of course, is what we call lovemaking.
Okay, Mami.
Which is ironic, because the birds were watching us.
Stop trying to change the subject.
Especially to that subject.
How did you never become a citizen? I was busy, you know! I was working, raising a family, helping my family to raise their family! Oh, you're welcome.
But anyway, it doesn't matter because I have a green card.
I get social security, I pay taxes.
Whoa.
You have to pay taxes with a green card? [GROANS LOUDLY] I am a permanent resident.
So it's almost the same thing.
It's no big deal.
[SIGHS] This actually makes me so much happier, Abuelita.
I understand.
It's not that you don't want to vote.
You can't.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Then this is great! Because green card holders can become citizens easily.
You just have to take tests.
I'll download the forms.
We'll get you in line to become a citizen.
No, thank you! She is so infuriating! I know, but right now she's embarrassed, and you being all over her is not the answer.
Let her calm down.
I'm gonna go vote in this very important election, and we're gonna talk later.
Okay? - Okay? - Yeah.
Whoo! Okay, it's fine.
I'm all good, guys! I texted my accountant, and he said 'cause I'm in the highest income bracket, I don't have to pay taxes.
[LAUGHS] USA! USA! USA! USA! [WHISPERS] Do I look suspicious? No.
You look very fashionable for the '90s.
Right here.
Can't stop thinking about Abuelita.
I can't believe she never told us she wasn't a citizen.
[SIGHS] Some people just carry around secrets.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [PLANES HOVERING] - [PLANES ROAR] - [CANS HISSING] Perfect.
Now let's break out those hot dogs while they're still warm.
Although, I could always warm 'em up.
You're gonna love this.
I improved on what you taught me.
They'll stay warm.
I double-wrapped them - in wax paper and foil.
- Mmm.
- [FOIL CRINKLING] - No, don't! That's too loud.
[EXCLAIMS] - It smells like bacon! - I brought bacon.
No! The usher's coming! Get rid of that evidence! Give it.
- Excuse me - Shh.
Movie.
Ma'am, we don't allow food that was not purchased at our concession stand.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Oh, shoot.
[CHUCKLES] I'm gonna have to confiscate that food, ma'am.
"Confiscate"? [SCOFFING] Okay, Officer.
There's a jumbo soft pretzel in it for you if you keep walking.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, ma'am.
- [WOMAN SHUSHING] - Seriously? [USHER SHUSHING] Let me tell you something.
I get that you're trying to do your job.
But come on.
I'm a mom out with my kid.
[WHISPERS] I don't know her.
And yeah.
Yeah, we broke your rules.
But you know who else broke the rules? Our founding fathers.
[WHISPERS] I really don't know her.
- Security.
- No! So yeah, I will leave! I'm gonna leave.
- But I will leave with my principles! - [PEOPLE SHUSHING] And a fully-loaded baked potato! Thank you so much for dealing with that Alex! Come on! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Perfecto.
And your accent is hysterical.
Abuelita, can we talk? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Okay.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] that was going to get me out of it.
Abuelita, you need to become a citizen.
This is a big deal! Everything's a big deal to you! If I light a candle, I am killing the air.
If I shop at Walmart, I am killing mom and pop.
If I cook pork, I am somehow killing pigs! What's going on here? Abuelita won't even talk to me about becoming a citizen.
This is not a joke.
We live in very anti-immigrant times! Baby, it's not that serious.
Yes, it is.
Carmen's parents weren't citizens.
Yeah, but nothing like that's gonna happen to Abuelita.
She's not gonna get deported.
She could be.
They're deporting Cubans now, too.
What? That doesn't make sense.
They should be importing us.
Things keep changing.
I mean, it's way worse for some other groups, but still.
Carmen lost her parents.
I lost my best friend.
[STAMMERS] And I just don't want to lose you.
[SIGHS] What if one day they decide to send all non-citizens back to where they came from? No! I can't go back to Canada! It's just so cold! So become an American citizen.
Both of you.
Elena's right, Mami.
What's the problem? Hmm? - Don't you like being in this country? - Of course.
I like to be in America.
[MIMICKING LYDIA] I know you do.
So what is the problem? When Berto and I learned that in order to be sworn in as Americans, we would have to renounce our Cuban citizenship, we could not bring ourselves to do it.
- Cuba is home.
Home-home.
- [SIGHS] But you've been here for almost 60 years, Mami.
This is your home now.
I know you miss Cuba.
But you know there's no going back, right? Even now that Castro's dead, nothing has really changed.
Yes.
But you know, maybe someday it will.
My papi made sure that I had the deed to our house.
And I still have it.
Just in case we ever go back there.
Mami I know.
It's silly.
But becoming an American citizen would be like giving up.
[SNIFFLES] I just wish you could have seen it like it was.
[SIGHS DEEPLY] I'm sorry.
Being cubana is who I am.
So much so, that I even bring it up now and then.
That will never change.
That's what we are.
Me, Elena, Alex.
You brought Cuba here and you gave it to us.
It's true.
Whenever someone asks me what I am, I always say I'm Cuban.
I don't even think about it.
Yeah.
When people ask me what I am, I say, "I'm a human being not defined by labels or the artificial construct of borders.
" But I also say I'm Cuban.
So please, Abuelita.
I hear what you are saying.
And I love you.
And I will think about it.
[SIGHS] Well, I've made my decision.
I'm gonna become a citizen.
Now, the English test should be a breeze, but as far as the civics test goes, I'd better put on my thinkin' toque, stock up on Timmies and study like a real keener, eh? I don't mind people moving here.
I just wish they'd learn the language.
- [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] - [CAN HISSING] What the hell am I doing? Hey, I've been thinking about what happened at the movies.
[SCOFFS] Me, too, papito.
And I'm so sorry I put you through all that.
And I didn't have to go back to take all those ketchup packets, but what, are we gonna buy Heinz at the store like the king of England? It's okay.
You taught me something important.
Good.
I need to get a job and work hard so I can buy real snacks and avoid looking like a total nutjob.
That's exactly the point I was trying to teach you.
Mom, have you seen Abuelita? Prop U passed and I want to tell her the good news.
I don't know where she is.
You guys better get on the road.
You don't want to be late for Comic-Con.
[LYDIA] Aw.
QuÃ© fun.
[CHUCKLES] My granddaughter is dating a box.
Actually, I'm the TARDIS.
Oh! "TARDIS.
" Elena said I must never use that word anymore.
Uh, it's from Doctor Who, Abuelita.
The TARDIS is a time-traveling police box.
I'm dressed as the Fourth Doctor.
Pretty sure people are going to want to take pictures with us, which is the ultimate Comic-Con win.
Next to being able to rap in Klingon.
Ay, pobrecita, you are even more of a nerd than Elena.
Ah.
You guys look great.
And, Alex [CHUCKLES] You look so handsome.
It's my first Bar Mitzvah.
I don't want to look like a schlemiel.
Dr.
Berkowitz has been teaching me Yiddish.
The kid's a natural.
I'm plotzing with nachas.
Ay, papito, I can't believe it's your first sleepover.
Yeah.
Only eight short years after all my friends had their first sleepover.
Hey! Be thankful that Abuelita and I are being so cool about it.
I vetted the mom.
She was in the Israeli army, super strict.
No guns in the home.
Liquor cabinet's locked.
No large dogs.
She gets it.
Okay, I color-coded the panel schedule so we can hit as many as we can before the Dungeons & Dragons session.
Roll a D20, with a plus-five to fun! Blink twice if you need help.
You're not gonna have time to talk to each other.
This is our first date, okay? I really like Syd.
I want them to like me back, so I packed our day full of stuff so I have no time to be awkward.
That's what's so brilliant about this schedule.
We never have to talk.
Mmm.
Talking is a good thing.
I bet you Doctor Who even talks to his patients.
He's not that kind of doctor.
He is a Time Lord, everybody knows this.
What's your costume? The Wicked Witch of the East Side? Don't make jokes about witchcraft.
It's like SanterÃ­a.
I don't believe in it but I respect it.
We're catching Pagliacci at the San Diego Opera House.
For some reason, I've always empathized with sad clowns.
[SIGHS] You guys gotta get moving.
Let's go! Come on! I have so much studying to do.
I'm gonna miss you guys, but you gotta beat the traffic, I gotta hit the books.
Ah, I'm gonna pull an all-nighter, make those little flashcards.
I'm gonna do some highlighting.
All right, I'm gonna miss you guys so much! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Okay.
Yes.
You look good, girl.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hid in the hallway until your family left, like a secret agent.
Then I did a shoulder roll.
Didn't have to, just felt cool.
Maybe I'll meet your family for real next time.
Uh, you don't want to meet those people.
How about for now, you just say hi to the girls? I thought you had a son and a Oh.
- [BOTH LAUGH] - [PENELOPE] Mmm.
Wait, hold on.
- Okay, let's go.
- [LAUGHING] [BOTH MOANING] [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTING] No.
That's my mom's room.
There's crosses, pictures of the Pope, and my dad's ghost's in there.
It's not a sexy place.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] What's that? Oh! It's just a police helicopter.
Otherwise known as Echo Park in July.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] We're in pursuit of a dangerous suspect.
He is armed.
Everyone, go back inside, and do not leave your building.
Think your family made it out? - [LYDIA GRUNTS] - [PENELOPE GASPS] Lupe! There is a murderer running loose.
Get in there.
Okay, coming! [PANTING] Coming! Yeah.
Okay! Oh, you guys are back.
Great, great, great, great, great.
There's a police helicopter out there.
They're not letting us leave.
- Why do you look so nice? - Oh, this? This is what I wear when you aren't here.
You just never see it.
I have never been more proud of you.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] For your safety, please remain inside until further notice.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] We're going to miss the masquerade and the dance party.
And the Firefly panel, the Zombie Run, the Buffy sing-a-long, and the super-gay Supergirl meet up.
But this lockdown is awesome.
Maybe it's the Daleks.
"Exterminate.
Exterminate.
" Actually, this seems like a pretty serious situation.
But it's okay.
We'll just hang out and talk.
[CHUCKLES] Talk? Yeah.
Wait.
Keep the costumes on, and go up to Schneider's.
He's a man-child who lives off his parents, and likes dressing up in weird outfits.
He is Comic-Con.
I think we're gonna be stuck here for a while.
- [LYDIA SIGHS] - I'm sorry we're going to miss the opera.
Let me see if I can get a refund on our tickets.
Hey, hey! Why are you going in here? Because it's where you make me live like a dog without a door.
Actually, Mami, why don't you make everyone something to eat? There are over three people, and no one is cooking.
What kind of Cuban are you? That's true.
Mala cubana.
Hey, kids, why don't you go to your rooms and wait until dinner? - Cool.
- [CHUCKLES] You want us to be alone in my room? Me and my date? Leave the door open.
Feet on the ground.
Alex will check on you.
- No, ew.
- Come on.
[LYDIA SCREAMS] [PENELOPE YELLING AND PANTING] My succulent died! Oh [KNOCK AT DOOR] - Ay, who is that? - [STAMMERS] It's probably one of those shirtless door-to-door salesmen.
[PENELOPE AND DR.
BERKOWITZ SCREAM] Hey, guys.
Why are you wearing a gas mask? Why aren't you? With all that's going on out there? Oh, man.
Now, look, I prepared us a survival kit.
It's a little bare-bones.
Water purification pills, MREs, enough cash to get us to Cape Verde by boat, just the basics.
[SIGHS] Anyway, you're safe now that I'm here.
- We were safe when you weren't here.
- Okay.
But can I stay? I'm all alone up there.
Do you have any idea how scary it is being a wealthy white man in a lavish apartment? [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] I'm a target! Of course you can stay, Schneider.
Why should this night be different from any other night? - [SCHNEIDER SIGHING] - [SPEAKING HEBREW] Nailed it.
[WHISPERS] Schneider, come here.
Max is here somewhere.
Unless he's Houdini.
Maybe he is, I don't know him that well.
What are you talking about? They were supposed to be gone, and he was just here, and we were supposed to, you know - Oh.
- [EXHALES SHARPLY] Shag City got shut down by the po-po.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been following him on Instagram.
Seems like a super cool dude.
Great abs.
[SIGHS] I know, right? [CHUCKLES] But it's way too soon.
Nobody is meeting him, especially not my mom.
One look at him, bam, she's sewing me in a wedding dress, and you'll be my maid of honor.
I would be so honored.
Look, right now our relationship is, like, the perfect little fantasy.
He hasn't seen me with zit cream on my face, and inhaling a bag of Cheetos like it's nothing.
And I don't know if I want him to.
I just wanna keep climbing him like a beanstalk, and never reach the top.
That's it.
I don't even wanna know his middle name.
Vernon.
Can I have my shirt? He looks shorter than I thought.
So, I guess you're stuck with me.
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] - Oh.
A Wrinkle in Time.
- Yeah, it's stupid.
- It's my favorite book.
- Stupid how much I love it.
You okay, there? Yeah.
I'm just super hungry.
For food.
Uh, how about we be normal and get snacks? - Elena, can you help me? - Shurbly-burbly.
- What is up with you? - Nothing.
Oh.
Are you "shurbly-burbly"? Help me make things less awkward.
You're good at talking.
People say you're charming.
People are right.
I'll work some magic.
Just because I'm missing the Bar Mitzvah doesn't mean I can't be a mensch.
Okay.
[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] Here, quick, Schneider, help me.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Okay, okay.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[BOTH GRUNTING] - Just go, just go.
- Go, go, go.
Yes, go.
All right.
Okay.
- [LYDIA SCREAMS] - [PENELOPE GASPS] Is that the killer? Leslie, stay behind me.
Wait.
No.
No, no, no.
You are too handsome to be a killer.
Thank you? Who are you? [STUTTERS] This? Him? [STAMMERS] Go ahead and tell them who he is.
This is Max, my sponsor.
From Alcoholics Anonymous.
So, forget I just said his name.
So great to meet you, Max.
Why don't you two head over to Schneider's apartment? - Yes! - Sounds great, Penelope.
It is Penelope? - Yeah, good guess.
Bye.
- Yeah.
[LYDIA] No, no, no, no.
Ridiculous.
We are in lockdown.
You must stay for dinner.
Okay, Double-A Alex Alvarez and Syd Vicious coming at you from hashtag, lockdown.
- See anything? - [HELICOPTER HOVERING] I see a fire escape, easy access for zombies.
You guys are my witnesses.
Alex, if I get bitten by a zombie, promise me right now that you will take me out.
Do not let me turn.
I'm not going to do that, Syd! I won't be Syd anymore! I'll kill you! [CELL PHONE RINGS] Ooh, they're FaceTiming me from the Bar Mitzvah.
Yeah, this can't be my background.
I'm out.
Oh, Alex, Alex, wait! Your brother's really cool.
He peed his pants once.
Recently? When he was a kid, but I thought you should know.
Dinner! Yay! Food! A group activity.
Let's do this! [MUSIC PLAYING OVER PHONE SPEAKER] Dang! Bubbe is dancing the Hora with Cousin Irving.
You guys are Jewish? [CHUCKLES] No Kids, don't be alarmed by this stranger.
This is Schneider's sponsor, Max.
- Okay.
- Hey.
Hey.
Doesn't she make beautiful children? Mm-hmm.
So, tell me, Max, does she make you want to, uh, fight a duel in her honor? I would kill a thousand men for the pleasure of her smile.
I like you, Max.
Well, I feel very welcome.
Although this is not what I had planned for the evening.
Well, I'm sure you can make it up by doing what you had planned two times on another night.
[CHUCKLES] Mmm.
Wow.
This is so good.
Did you help cook this, Doc? As a matter of fact, I did.
Your mom and I, we work well together.
We're like two peas in a pod.
Yes, it was fun.
It was like cooking with one of my sisters.
Just the comparison I was hoping for.
I wish I could cook, but, uh Oh, no, you are too busy being a real man.
Oh, you would've been perfect for a younger me.
But, look, there is one right here.
Actually, I'm more like my dad.
Actually, Lydia, I am seeing someone, but she's really hard to read.
I don't know if she's serious about me.
She says she just wants to climb me like a beanstalk.
Drop that loser.
Yeah, man, that is insane! Who wouldn't want all this? Those sick tris and strong core, it's like looking in the mirror.
Yes.
Max, you deserve someone with beauty and brains, and shares the same passion you have to help people, like a nurse.
Remind me, honey, what is it you do every day? Price one-way flights back to Cuba.
Well, make fun of me all you want, but every woman needs a man.
- [CLEARS THROAT] - [SIGHS] Most women need a man.
Someone like my Berto.
Someone who can protect you, who can kill spiders for you, who can make passionate love to you to celebrate the death of a spider.
[ELENA SIGHS] Abuelita, come on.
You're putting things in such absolute binary gender terms.
It's reductive and it perpetuates toxic myths about masculinity.
Yeah, stop perpetrating and stuff.
You look cute on that high horse.
Uh, okay.
Right.
Got it.
Thanks so much for dinner but I'm not really that hungry, so I'm gonna chill till the lockdown's over.
They are walking away from my meal? This is your fault.
[HELICOPTER HOVERING] What are you doing out here? Pretty clear you didn't want me in the apartment, so [ELENA SIGHS] [GRUNTS AND SIGHS] - I'm sorry, I just - It's cool.
Uh, message received.
What message? What did you receive? That you aren't into me.
It's okay.
I'm cool with being friends.
I don't want to be your friend.
Oh, great.
Way to let me down easy.
No, look, it's the opposite.
I like you so much! Like, so, so much.
Yeah? You have a really weird way of showing it.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing and I don't wanna mess this up.
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] Please go back inside! Kissing teenagers, please go back inside! In a minute! - Don't worry.
- [CHUCKLES] I'll protect you.
No, I'll protect you.
Oh, because you're the one who kissed me first, so you're the protector? - That is so reductive.
- [CHUCKLES] How about we protect each other? Deal.
[OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] Remain inside.
We have an armed suspect still in the area.
Wow, they still haven't caught him.
Don't worry.
We have a man to protect us.
It's like we're invisible.
I'm glad you're here, too, dude.
That guy breaks in, you could take him.
You're like a male Wonder Woman.
That's your go-to? Stop scaring everyone, all right? Nobody's breaking in.
The police will take care of it.
And no one is fighting with anyone.
Your papi would! He once fought a waiter for stealing a look at me in the reflection of a spoon.
That's different.
Maybe a million years ago in Havana, you could get away with that stuff.
That was ten years ago in an IHOP.
Fighting is not the only option.
Whatever happened to running away? It's a Berkowitz family tradition.
So what, Leslie? It's good to be a coward? I'm afraid so.
So many of our heroes were cowards.
Aeneas ran away from Troy and founded Rome.
The Pilgrims fled England, and all they did was start a little country called America.
Shaggy and Scooby always run away from the bad guys.
But then, they solve the damn crime! The only reason why you know about a dead hero is because a live coward was there to tell his story! In this case, I think you're right because that guy out there has a gun.
And that is why I always felt safer knowing that your papi had a gun.
Whoa.
Really? Wait, are you saying there was a gun in the house while I was growing up? Oh, well before that.
It was a wedding gift from the Fajardos.
Of course, they wouldn't give us something from the registry.
Well, I love Papi, but that's a mistake.
Guns aren't safe.
That's why we don't have one in this house.
Okay.
Mami.
Why did you say "okay" like that? Where is it? Don't know what you're talking about.
There is a little something in my nightstand.
It's not very big and it certainly will never replace your father, but it does the job.
Is it weird that I hope it's a gun? Dang! Abuelita's packing heat! Mami.
How dare you keep something like this from me.
Relax, it isn't even loaded.
Your papi had it to protect me.
And now, I have it to protect us.
I can't believe this.
For the last decade, I've been the annoying parent that asks other parents do they own a gun.
Well, you didn't ask me.
I don't understand why you are so horrified.
Let me tell you something.
In Cuba, I saw the government turn against its own people.
We were helpless.
So, it is good to live in a country that lets you protect yourself! Now that Victor is gone, it's only just three women and a papito, all alone! - [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] - Look what's going on.
Who knows what terrible thing could happen? You can justify this any way you want, but it doesn't matter.
More bad things happen because you own a gun, not because you don't.
- That is why I hid it away.
- But that's what everybody says, Ma.
"I locked it up.
I'm careful.
I know how to use it.
" Everybody thinks they're the exception.
But no matter where you hide it, kids find it.
And accidents happen.
And things that aren't accidents.
We have teenagers in this house.
We have a gay teenager in this house.
We have a veteran with PTS.
This is the last house that should have a gun.
I didn't think of it that way, Lupita.
I am sorry.
[SIGHS] It's fine.
It's okay.
But we're turning that in to the police, got it? Okay, okay.
- We have a gun! - No, Mami, no! No, no! No.
[SIGHS] The police station.
Tomorrow.
Okay.
We're getting rid of the gun.
Can you put this at your place until tomorrow morning? I'll put it in my panic room.
- Why didn't you go there? - I panicked.
[PENELOPE SIGHS] Heck of a night to meet your family.
And you.
It's a good thing that we're just casual acquaintances, otherwise, I'd be pretty embarrassed.
You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
Although, someone did grab my butt tonight.
It was either your mom or Schneider.
[SIGHS] [OFFICER OVER SPEAKER] Attention, the suspect has been apprehended.
You may come out of your homes.
The lockdown is over.
Well, I did it.
I got us through this.
So, what do you say, sponsor? Lunch tomorrow? Yeah! Sure, dude.
Let's do it.
So, should I just get your number from Penelope or Oh, we're really doing this? All right.
Syd, I'll give you a ride home.
Uh, do you mind if we listen to Pagliacci in the car? I must warn you, I weep from start to finish.
That's cool.
Nothing can make me sad right now.
[ELENA CHUCKLES] I will walk you out to make sure you are safe.
I still have these guns.
You know, Lydia I bet ya I could nurse this cactus back to life.
They say I have quite the green thumb.
Oh? Nothing dies on my watch.
Oh.
Oh, and goodbye, Max.
And I hope that idiota that you are dating realizes what she has.
Thank you, Lydia.
Me, too.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Well, I don't know, Max.
I'm sure that girl's more into you than you think she is.
Maybe invite her over for dinner Saturday night for Thai food, 7:45, and wear those boxer briefs you know she likes? And if you wanna talk, I'm sure she'd be down for it.
It's nice meeting you idiota.
Mami, I know your secret.
Okay.
[CHUCKLES] I was gonna tell you.
I really was You're gonna get rid of it? What? Your gun.
Under the floorboard in your bedroom.
In the safe.
How do you know about that? I thought maybe it was Christmas presents.
I figured out the combination, I'm sorry.
- Did you touch it? - No, I only looked at it.
Okay.
[SIGHS] Look, I was in the army.
I was trained how to use it.
Not everybody is.
When your papi left, I didn't wanna find ourselves in a position where we needed one and didn't have it.
You always say that's what everyone says.
But I'm different.
I know how [SIGHS] I'll get rid of it.
Okay.
Good.
And that guy? Max? What? I know he has a girlfriend, but whatever, - you could take her, Mom.
- [LAUGHS] Okay.
Thanks, papito.
 I am crushing it.
I've never played so well.
I am burying you.
You realize you're the top half of the screen? No! Ah! I'm glad you're here, Schneider.
Finally.
I knew I'd hear those words one day.
The lights in the laundry room are out still.
I don't know whose bra this is, but she has a wild side, and I'm into it.
Can you do some work for once? Ah, what's the point? I change a light bulb.
A year later, I gotta change it again.
I mean, what are we doing here? That's mine.
Anyway, I'll fix the lights.
I gotta call my guy, Butch.
So, do that.
Don't micromanage me! What you need to do is to study with me for our citizenship tests.
Are you going to sit on that couch, eating junk food, watching TV all day? Or are you going to be an American? Please.
I'm very patriotic.
Look in that basket.
There's a bald eagle thong.
Check me out! Oh Sweet kicks, papito.
Abuelita, take a picture for my Insta.
Gonna stare this way so it doesn't look like I know you're doing it.
- Okay.
Okay.
- [PHONE CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] What's going on south of your ankles, buddy? Aren't those the expensive sneakers I said you couldn't have? They were a gift from an admirer.
Mami I can spend my money how I want to.
How about contributing to the rent? I'm a senior! I'm on a fixed income! Mami, I'm trying to teach Alex the value of a dollar.
You need to pay for those or send them back.
I thought you wanted to get a summer job.
Ah, what's the point? I get some money, I spend some money.
I mean, what are we doing here? Preach.
Alex, those shoes stay in your closet until you find a way to pay Abuelita back.
Okay.
Fine.
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh [DEEP INHALE] Your debt is forgiven.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] Stop pampering him! Scott and Lori are on vacation.
Dr.
Berkowitz needs somebody in the office to help with filing.
Oh But if he goes to work with you, I barely get to see him.
Yeah, I'm okay with that.
- You start tomorrow.
- [SIGHS] You're so unfair! Alex seems very upset.
I'm gonna buy him something.
[LAUGHS] What are you laughing at, freeloader? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I told you three times already you need to get a summer job.
Yeah, I know.
And that is why I got one.
You did? Just hear me out.
I started my own channel on Twitch.
It's a site where you make money when people watch you play video games.
[LAUGHS] Oh, my God.
You had me there for a second.
You did.
No, no, no, no.
It's a real thing.
It's like what they say, "Do what you love, and the money will follow.
" Ay, baby.
That's for rich white ladies who want to make jewelry.
No, no.
Penelope, this could be huge.
Hey, can I be your unpaid intern? - What are your qualifications? - This is all my stuff.
- You're hired! - Yes! Elena, you need to get a real job.
One where you sweat, get blisters, wear an ill-fitting polyester uniform.
Those things don't breathe! [LYDIA] Yeah.
Listen, when I was your age, I had three jobs.
Courier, seamstress and I sold Avon door-to-door.
[PENELOPE] Thank you.
When I was your age, I was scooping ice cream.
By the end of the summer, my right arm looked like Popeye, the left one looked like Olive Oyl.
Then I joined the army.
Almost died.
Get a job.
All right.
Mom, look.
I have a plan.
If I get 1,000 subscribers, I'll make more than I would doing any minimum wage job.
Just give me a chance.
Okay.
I do like that you are showing initiative, so I'm gonna give you one week.
Thank you, Mom.
Come on.
We better get back to work.
We're all going to hell.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Thanks, Doc.
This is gonna be great for him and for me.
I loved the summer I worked with my papi.
On the drive home, we'd have these long talks, and they were the closest times we ever had.
When I go out with my daughters, they make me follow in a separate cab.
Alex, you are about to see your mom in action.
She is the best at what she does and commands respect.
Here's my urine.
Okay, sir.
Penelope, thanks again for squeezing me in on short notice.
Money's tight and it was great not to miss a day of work.
Ugh.
I hear ya.
Oh! This is right out of the oven.
[LAUGHS] So, we talked about your protein levels.
- I'll call, soon as I get the results.
- Thank you.
If every nurse were more like you, people wouldn't hate going to the doctor.
You're just saying that so I give you a lollipop.
- And here you go.
- [CHUCKLES] Ha! You hear that, papito? I got followers in real life.
[LAUGHS] Papito? Come on! You are missing all the action.
That guy just said I am the BeyoncÃ© of nurses.
Okay, but I made a really good playlist.
It's all songs with "boy" in the title.
So I can remember how innocent I was before you forced me to work here.
Heh.
When we're at work, we work.
This is not a dance party.
[SINGING IN SPANISH] [LAUGHS] What are you doing here? Well, you left so quickly this morning that I didn't have a chance to spritz papito with violetas.
No, no, Mami.
This is a doctor's office.
You cannot be spraying that.
Ah, damn it.
Hit me.
[SNIFFS] I thought I smelled your mother.
Oh, I feel so proud of my little genius doctorcito.
Hi, Lydia.
Oh! Hi, Leslie.
I forgot you work here.
[CHUCKLES] Don't mind me.
I just brought papito a working man's lunch.
So, we got a roast beef sandwich, a ham sandwich, a turkey sandwich, half of a rotisserie chicken, the other half of the rotisserie chicken and a whoopie pie.
[CHUCKLES] - What'd you bring me? - Here is yogurt and some rouge.
SiÃ©ntate.
It's so good that your mother is here.
You know, now, maybe, she could watch me do my thang.
You're not gonna start with the magic tricks, are you? No, practicing medicine.
I've been a little bit on edge about our "relationship.
" - Why'd you put that in quotes? - She asked me to.
I get it.
I was hoping Alex could see me do my thang, too.
But so far it's just been cold cuts and hot pee.
No, no, I get it.
If someone would just drop dead and I could revive them in front of her, really give her a show! Papito, there is mustard on your chin.
Oh? Does someone need a napkin? No.
So, how was your day? Wanna talk? Nah, I'm good.
Come on, it was your first day on the job.
What was the most interesting thing that happened? I saw a folder for a guy named David Davids.
That was kind of weird.
What? That's hilarious! [LAUGHS] Actually, Mr.
Davids passed away.
We should probably shred that file.
Anything else you took away from today? Yeah.
It must be hard to be a nurse.
It is.
It's so boring! So much of your day is shining a light in people's noses and filling out forms.
It's like you're an accountant who also has to look at boogers.
I don't know how you do this every day.
Yeah, you can put the headphones back on.
This is Blanquita16, and we are about to get started playing in VR mode.
So as you can see, the graphics are amazing.
That 4K is really working its magic.
Schneider the intern, checking in.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I just wanna say, it's a real honor playing as a woman.
A real pleasure.
Stop it! I'm trying.
How are women not distracted all day? I cannot believe you two.
Talking to peoples who aren't even there.
[SCOFFS] Can you believe this, Berto? Anyway We're about to battle, but first, let's check out those lifelike reflections on the floor.
[BOTH] Oh [BOTH EXCLAIMING] But I'm a lady! - What the hell is going on? - I'm working, Mom! Penelope, tell my third stepmother I loved her! Not the second one, though.
She was kind of a jerk.
Say goodbye to your whole stepfamily, 'cause you're [EXCLAIMS] finished! Okay, guys, subscribe to my channel.
This is Blanquita16 signing off.
Peace in the real world, chaos everywhere else.
AdiÃ³s! Sorry, I was wrong.
This is obviously work.
It's like watching a business class at Harvard.
It's going great.
I'm up to over 100 subscribers.
Yeah, Elena is legit.
She's gonna be a mogul, have an entourage, probably a jet.
Mogul, entourage, jet? Those are my things! Elena, give papito back his things.
She's been working really hard at this.
I'm so inspired.
Makes me wanna get a job.
- You have a job.
- No, this is just an internship.
- Fix the lights.
- I'll call Butch.
Whatever! Look, Elena, I'm glad this is going well.
- But how much money have you made? - Seven thousand magic pebbles, redeemable for virtual stickers.
Elena, a real job is much more Boring.
Papito, no.
You just came on the wrong day.
It's usually much more exciting.
The other day, this guy came in with a rash that looked like a smiley face.
[LAUGHS] Come on.
I'm gonna return the shoes.
No.
You have a job.
And I hate that job.
I wanna do what Elena's doing or anything else.
You can't quit after one day.
You gotta see this rash.
His nipples are the eyes.
Ew! I'm going to teach you a very important part of medicine.
How to take a patient history.
So, why don't you pretend to be Oh, I don't know your grandmother? That's weird.
But I'm super bored, so sure.
Great, great, great.
Okay.
First question.
Uh Age? [IMITATES LYDIA] A lady never tells.
Of course.
Of course.
Any allergies? My Cuban blood is far too strong.
Man, you are good.
Okay.
Okay.
- Favorite flower? - [IN NORMAL VOICE] That a medical thing? It's related to the allergies.
Just answer the question.
- I guess gardenias.
- Perfect.
So, Thai food at home or duck Ã  l'orange at a candlelit bistro? Look, Doc, my grandma likes you.
You just need to be a little more chill.
Not so available.
Be busy sometimes.
And that is why you always wear gloves.
- Nurse Alvarez, do you have a second? - Yeah.
Of course I do.
Come in.
What can I do for you? I wanted to come back and tell you that you totally screwed me over.
[CHUCKLES] Excuse me? My insurance company is charging me for my physical, because it happened in the same 365-day period as my last one, and I'm covered for one a year! I'm sorry that's happening, but you did call and ask to be seen as soon as possible.
No, I would have waited if I knew it was gonna cost me money.
[INHALES, EXHALES] Know what? I'm gonna go to Dr.
Mazzara from now on.
Send my stuff there.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll do that.
Try not to screw that up, too.
So, um, how was your day? Wanna talk? Nah.
I'm good.
What was the most interesting thing that happened? Okay, I'll go first.
I discovered that the coffee machine also makes hot cocoa.
What? Total game changer.
[SIGHS] So, how about that guy that went off on you? [SCOFFS] Does that happen a lot? Sometimes.
[SIGHS] It's part of the gig.
Gotta put up with crap you don't want to.
Some days you're taking blood pressure, and you just wanna keep squeezing, and squeezing and squeezing until their stupid eyes pop out of their stupid head.
Dang, Mami! It's fine.
Put those headphones back on.
[SCREAMS] - I didn't push play yet.
- [EXHALES] Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll wait till you push play.
[SCREAMS AND PANTS] Okay, guys.
I'm finally on pace to beat this speed run.
Only 57 failed attempts.
No big.
[CHUCKLES] Elena, what are the first few words of the Declaration of Independence? Leave me alone.
I know that's the gist of it.
Abuelita, I'm working.
Okay, fine.
I don't need you anyways, because I have Cuban tricks to remember American facts.
Por ejemplo, the American flag is red, white and blue.
The Cuban flag is red, white, and blue.
The American flag has 50 stars.
And Cuba has one.
Me.
I'm recording! What is going on now? I'm working and you're in my office! Elena, I had a long day at work.
Can I have five minutes of peace and quiet after I walk through the door? The usual? No, no.
Leave the bottle.
[SQUEALS] Elena, when is the last time you slept [SNIFFS] or took a shower? Those aren't options when you're building a brand.
I can help.
No, no, no.
Get out of here! I'm falling behind.
My subscribers expect constant content.
There's this couple in Bulgaria who are just waking up that I can't disappoint.
Dobro utro, Mr.
and Mrs.
Berbatov.
Wait.
Dude, you're in the final castle.
I know.
I'm almost there.
Just one more What? What is Hey, guys.
Butch was busy, so I was doing a little sleuthing on the electrical panel.
Question.
Did the power go off for a couple seconds? I have to start over.
I'm gonna kill you! - Whoa! You seem stressed, boss.
Coffee? - Get over here! [SCREAMING] [PENELOPE] Stop it! Yeah! And, girl, you smell rank.
And like violets? - Get out! - Okay, all right.
Breathe.
Come on, baby.
What's wrong with you? I need you to breathe.
I'm going crazy.
Last time I went to the bathroom, 18 hours ago, I looked in the mirror, and all I saw was a wildling.
I tried to swipe her away, but I couldn't.
And she was trying to swipe me.
Yeah.
You're not doing this anymore.
It's over.
What? Actually, thank you so much.
I thought playing video games for a living would be amazing.
Then it got hard and tedious and not fun.
It's just more like - A job? - Yeah.
Yes.
It's okay.
You're 16.
You don't need to build a brand.
You need to make a little money, so you could feel good about yourself.
I know I told you my first job was hard, but, um, was it? I spent the whole summer eating free ice cream and flirting with Joe Camarda.
Sounds pretty good.
Especially if Joe were Jodi.
There you go.
The point is, you have the rest of your life to hate your job.
And you will.
'Cause when you're an adult, work is terrible.
When you're not taking someone's pee, you're taking their crap.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR] Ay, Leslie.
For me? Hi, Lydia.
I forgot you lived here.
Penelope, you remember Liese Aucoin? She was the patient with all of the back pain.
Yeah.
I thought it was some sort of strained muscle, but your mother, she could tell something was off.
So we sent Liese in for more tests.
And we discovered it was lymphoma.
But we caught it early, she made a full recovery.
And just last week, she had a baby girl.
She said that she never would've had a daughter without you.
And so she named her Penelope.
Oh So, what I'm hearing is this is not my gift basket? Mom, that's awesome.
Yes.
You see? Work isn't always terrible.
This showed up after you left, and I knew you had a pretty rough day, so I thought I would run it over.
- Thanks, Doc.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I got something for you, young man.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Good work this week.
Thank you.
Leslie, can I make you a plate for dinner? I wish I could, but I'm busy.
You are? Doing what? I don't know! [CHUCKLES] Guys, look at Baby Penelope.
See? When I asked you to come work with me, Alex, these are the things I wanted to share.
- You know, this is what's important - Oh, my God! $80! Yeah! Okay.
That's important, too.
Check me out, I'mma make it rain.
It's more like a drizzle, but all right.
Congratulations, papito.
Man, I worked so hard and I never even made any money.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Get yourself a little something on me.
- I'm gonna kill you! - No! No! [BOTH SCREAMING] Whatever.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, Schneider.
I noticed you finally fixed the lights in the laundry room.
Bravo.
Ah, it was the least I could do.
Also, I didn't do it.
See, I realized why I wasn't happy at work.
Because you never push yourself and you have the soft, white hands of a geisha? Oh Arigato.
But it's really that I'm more of a manager than a "worker," per se.
So I hired an assistant to handle all the basics around the building while I focus on the big-picture stuff.
Check it out.
I'm Butch.
- [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - [CHUCKLES] Mmm! "I love you.
" From P.
Who's P? Papito.
I text myself encouragements.
I love you, too, papito.
Look at you, all in love with your secret girlfriend.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES] [CHUCKLES] You're the one with the girlfriend.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES] Hey, come on, no phones at dinner.
- [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - [CHUCKLES] What? This could be Dr.
Berkowitz.
But you laughed.
Leslie's jokes are not funny.
Knock, knock.
Who's there? Who cares? Well, he was nice enough to let me come home early so we could eat together.
He had plans, so it worked out.
- Did he mention where he was going? - I didn't ask.
Did he mention who he was going with? Mami, I don't know.
Why do you care anyway? Aren't you two just friends? SÃ­, of course.
Did he turn right or left out of the parking lot? Just look at his Facebook.
He checks in everywhere.
Last week, he checked in at his attorney's office and wrote, "Hashtag, my daughter is suing me.
" Syd and I would never stalk each other on social media.
I don't want to stalk him.
I want to know exactly where he is and follow him there.
- Show me, papito.
- Okay.
He just checked in downtown at the opera.
"Hashtag, just checked in downtown at the opera.
" But I always accompany him to the opera.
[SCOFFS] It's not like he took another woman! [ALL LAUGH] You think so? Mami, no.
Because that's ridiculous.
He probably took a family member.
Yeah.
Like his daughter, who is suing him.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] take whoever he wants.
Abuelita, are you okay? I am fine, papito.
I am very, how do you say Very chill.
Â¡Carajo! Yeah.
That ain't chill.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] I'm going to the opera.
Mami, really? You're gonna go spy on Dr.
Berkowitz? How are you going to hide looking like the Latina Breakfast at Tiffany's? I'm not wearing earrings.
He will never recognize me.
My God, Mami, this is crazy.
Also, opera tickets are expensive.
How are you gonna afford it? Hummer limo's downstairs.
- She roped you into this? - Are you kidding? I'm thrilled! My third stepmother used to take me to the racetrack to spy on Father.
For the longest time, I thought she was saying, "Your father is with Rebecca, that horse!" I need to put on my lipstick.
Okay.
So your secret girlfriend is P Pearl? Patricia? Padmini? Ooh Maybe P's not a student.
Mrs.
Perez, the lunch lady? Yeah.
I have a thing for hairnets and tater breath.
I am going to find out who your secret girlfriend is.
Papito, if you have a secret girlfriend, I need to know about it.
Also, you're not allowed to have a girlfriend or keep secrets.
Hey, how are you and Max doing? [SHUSHES] That's a secret.
But, um [CLICKS TONGUE] We doin' real good.
[CHUCKLES] All right.
So you guys exclusive? Yeah.
Of course.
I mean, I Well, I think.
I keep him pretty busy with our regular once-a-week thing.
Let me just check my calendar.
Yep.
There are seven days in a week.
Yeah, but he doesn't have time to meet anybody else.
He has a full-time job.
- You met him at work, didn't you? - Why don't you shut up? [SIGHS] Is this something I should worry about? Max probably has women throwing themselves at him.
Can't argue with you there.
He could have anyone, but he chose you.
Okay, I know that's not the end of that sentence.
So, Schneider, are you ready for the opera? You mean our secret spy mission, Lydia? The name is Bond.
James Lydia Margarita del Carmen Inclan Maribona Leyte-Vidal de Riera Bond.
[INSTRUMENTS TUNING] Do you see him? No.
Not yet.
[GASPS] What is it? I found him.
He's sitting next to a woman! [GASPS] What does she look like? Old.
Very old.
It's like someone wheeled in her coffin and dumped her into her seat.
Must be his mother.
I'm glad there's nothing to worry about.
Can we stay? We haven't even heard the fat lady sing.
That's where that comes from.
No! [STUTTERS] What's happening? I was wrong.
Leslie just took the hand of a beautiful woman who was sitting on his other side.
How dare he have other friends! It's like I'm back at the racetrack with my stepmom.
What's next? Throw a mint julep in his face? I am going to grab him by the aguacates and feed them to that soprano! Not as fun.
But I'm down.
[MAX MOANS SOFTLY] [CHUCKLES] That's nice.
Especially that.
I came over here to talk.
I want to talk about what's going down.
The sitch.
Ya feelin' me? - I would like to be.
- No! [LAUGHS] I need to know you're not sleeping with anyone else.
Oh Okay.
[GRUNTS] Yeah.
We never really talked about it.
It's not a big deal.
Whatever.
But are you? - Yeah.
- [SCOFFS] Since when? Since last night.
But don't worry, we just cuddled.
[SHUDDERS] That is so much worse! [SIGHS] This is Luna.
[CHUCKLES] She's hairy but pretty cute.
I'm petsitting for my cousin while she's in Orlando.
[SCOFFS] You really got me going there.
I was about to go all psycho on you.
I was looking to see what I could set fire to.
I had my eye on that football.
But it doesn't matter.
What's important is you're not sleeping with anyone.
Just me, myself and I.
I still need to hear you say it, though.
Penelope, I am not sleeping with anyone else.
And I'm really happy you want to be exclusive.
Ew.
Do we have to call it that? That's what you want, right? To be a couple? A couple of people who don't sleep with anyone else and don't need labels! [CHUCKLES] It's still 45 minutes once a week.
Ten minutes of blah, blah.
ten minutes of eats and drinks, five minutes of [KISSES] fifteen minutes of [GRUNTING] And five minutes of "Where's my bra?" Up top! Hey, Alex.
You won't tell us who your secret girlfriend P is.
So, we pulled up your Instagram and narrowed it down to 15 possible girls.
Incidentally, "15 possible girls" would be a great name for a genderqueer punk band.
I know she's crazy, but, Syd, come on, you're better than this.
Aw I'm really not.
- Is it her? - No.
- Is it her? - No.
- Is it her? - That's Selena Gomez! I wish.
Me, too.
What? I have a type.
Wait, it didn't occur to me until now, but P could totally be a boy.
[ALEX SIGHS] Elena, I've been waiting for the right time to tell you but I'm straight.
Feels good to say it out loud.
Come on, Alex, let us help you.
I mean, I made this happen.
And I'm a girl, who likes girls, which means I know everything there is to know about girls.
[CHUCKLES] I'll say.
Please don't say.
If I tell you some stuff, can you leave me alone? I can't guarantee that, but spill! [SIGHS] Okay! Her name is Paige.
She doesn't go to our school, she's at St.
Teresa's, and she's left-handed and lactose intolerant.
She seems interesting.
She's flawed and she's comfortable announcing it.
- I like her.
- I like her, too.
We like her.
Oh, good, 'cause I really cared.
- Why have you been keeping her a secret? - It's not respectful.
Um None of my friends like her and I wish we could all hang out.
So if you like her, then who cares what other people think? What do you want, Alex? I want this to end.
But I'd also like to keep seeing her.
Then do what makes you happy.
Thanks, guys.
That actually does help.
Great! Okay, now let's plan the perfect date.
Look up left-handed-friendly restaurants in Los Angeles.
What are you doing? You said to do what makes me happy.
So, peace! I cannot believe that Leslie is with that woman.
And she is letting him hold her hand like a Dirty horse? [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] Let's make him jealous.
Dale, put your arm around me.
[LAUGHS] Ay, no! Now, I am going to drop my program and you will check out my fondillo.
What's a fondillo Oh, there it is! So, look for me.
What are they doing now? Uh Well, she's letting go of his hand.
Ooh, looks like she's heading for the bathroom.
Wow! She really hauled fondillo outta here.
Nice shade.
Is it Scarlet Sunrise? - Yes, it is.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] How did you know? - It is my shade.
[LAUGHS] - Ah I really like those heels.
Marshalls.
Worth $50 but I got them for $10.
Never pay full price for fabulous.
So are you, eh Are you here with your husband? On a date.
With a very nice doctor.
Ah [CHUCKLES] And you? A date, too, with a much younger man.
Oh - Good for you.
Mmm.
- [CHUCKLES] What does he do? Did I mention he is much younger? [SIGHS] I should get back.
- Me, too.
It was very nice meeting you.
- Mm-hmm.
And what is your name? Esme.
It was a pleasure to meet you, too - Lydia! - [GASPS] How do you know my name? I know everything about you and Leslie! You're the wallpaper on his phone! I tried to make him delete it, but neither of us knows how.
EstÃºpido smartphone.
[IN SPANISH] Wait a minute.
You speak Spanish? [IN SPANISH] Of course.
I'm Puerto Rican.
And I'm Cuban! [EXCLAIMS] When did you arrive? In '62.
[CHUCKLES] What about you? In '74.
That's great! it seems Leslie has a type.
I'm like the younger, taller, more attractive version of you, who is smarter as well.
Well, I look younger than you.
And I feel taller than you.
And after me, they broke the mold.
It probably disintegrated with age.
Leslie deserves better than you.
And that is me! Ah, you think so, huh? - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [GASPING] - [CACKLES] - [SCREAMING] That shade has been discontinued! I know.
I bought a case of it before they sold out.
- [EXCLAIMS] - [LAUGHS] Stay away from my friend! I spoke to Max and he is not seeing anyone else.
Oh, good.
So, he's not sleeping with or dating anyone else? Why'd you separate those things? - What things? - Sleeping together and dating.
'Cause they're different.
No, they're not.
Are they? [GROANING] Oh, my God.
Dating someone is getting to know them, wearing pants.
Sleeping with someone is not getting to know them, not wearing pants I get it! So, what? Now I need to have another conversation with Max to see if he's dating other women? Or you could just stalk him on Instagram.
That's so weird you follow him, 'cause you don't even follow me.
So I can read your boring inspirational quotes? "You can spell impossible without 'I'm possible.
'" My cousin, Christina, texted me and told me she needed that! Okay, so I don't see any pictures of women on here.
- That's a good sign, right? - Not necessarily.
We need to check out what he's tagged in.
- Oh - What? What? What is it? I don't think I should tell you.
Women in your family don't handle these things well.
The manager of the opera said your mother was the biggest diva he's ever seen.
And think about where he works! Just give me that damn phone.
Oh He's tagged in so many photos with Really? Leggymeggy35? Here they are at a barbecue, at a Dodgers game.
At the beach, where she's falling out of her bikini top! Wow I don't think Meggy's ever seen her leggies.
Are those all things you got from Dr.
Berkowitz? Who? And yes! [LAUGHS] Remember when he bought you this jar opener at the Dollar Store? That's what that is? I thought it was a ThighMaster.
[SIGHS] Ay, Mami I know you say you're just friends, but admit it.
You have feelings for him, don't you? Bueno, I will admit that I am sad to lose him.
The cheater! - Who is just my friend.
- [CLICKS TONGUE] But you can't really be mad at Dr.
Berkowitz.
Don't you think it's unfair to expect a commitment when you're not interested in dating him? - I don't want to.
- Then he's allowed to date other people.
- But I don't want him to.
- But you can't control that.
- But I don't like it.
- But it's not fair to him.
- Oh - What's wrong? I just realized I'm you.
One can dream.
Okay, so, I know you're not sleeping with anyone else.
But are you dating someone else? I don't know if you know this, but those are two separate things.
I knew it! What's going on? I checked Instagram and I saw that you were tagged in a bunch of photos by Leggymeggy35.
So, who is that? [SIGHS] Look, Penelope I love spending 45 whole minutes with you a week.
But I want more.
Right.
So, I mean, do I like you? Yeah, I do.
A lot.
Why do you think I have a bottle of rosÃ© in my fridge? Or DVR Scandal? Or have a throw? I'm not a rosÃ©-drinking, Scandal-watching guy with a cold lap.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] But on the off-chance you want to spend some actual time together I have all those things ready.
What was that? You taped Scandal for me.
[CHUCKLES] I'm four behind.
Glad you're happy.
Still gonna need to hear you say it.
Can't you look into my eyes and see what I'm trying to say? Guys can't do that.
You gotta say it.
[SIGHS] Fine.
I want to be your girlfriend.
And that would make me your Boyfriend.
Oh, my God.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [SIGHS] So When do you think you might tell Leggymeggy35 to beat it? Later tonight? Or right now is as good a time as any.
Ooh, I could, but my family's gonna be really upset.
Why? She's my cousin.
What? Why didn't you just tell me that? And miss all this? - You're good.
- Mmm.
When do you think you'll tell your family we're dating and I'm not Schneider's friend? 'Cause that's an embarrassing thing to have people think.
Okay, everybody, I have an announcement.
All right, everybody, I'm seeing somebody.
- [LYDIA] Oh - [ELENA] Ooh! Who is he? Or she? Or they? [SIGHS] She's been like this all day.
It is a man.
Oh - It is a stallion! - [SCOFFS] Everybody say hi again.
- Hi, Max.
- Hi.
[CHUCKLES] Tell me, Max.
Did you want a wedding in a church or a wedding on the beach? There is a right answer.
Okay, everybody say bye to Max! - Bye.
- [ELENA] Bye, Max! We'll have you over for dinner real soon! Okay.
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Hey.
Hi, everyone.
We all have stuff to do, right? Yeah, I'm actually meeting a friend for pizza.
Oh.
Meeting a friend for pizza? I think I might be hungry for pizza, too.
Okay.
[DOOR CLOSES] I suppose I owe you an explanation.
No need.
This is my curse.
Everybody falls in love with me.
They can't have me and it drives them to do crazy things like date women who look like me after being hit by a typhoon.
I'm sorry if I hurt you, Lydia.
The only reason I went out with Esme is that you made it very clear that you wanted to just be friends.
And I want more than that.
I know, Leslie.
And I understand.
But to tell the truth I could never really give my heart to you because it already belongs to someone else.
Berto.
[SHAKILY] He is the love of my life.
And I cannot see myself being romantic with anyone else.
It is how you say I am exclusive.
[SNIFFLES] I understand.
And, you know, things really don't have to change between us.
We could still be friends.
No.
Esme is not going to be comfortable with you coming here to grab something that I cannot reach or dry the dishes or water the plants.
We had some wild times, didn't we? Yes.
And the opera.
[INHALES DEEPLY] [SPEAKING SPANISH] allow you to take a more beautiful and elegant woman who is smarter as well.
So I I guess it's over? Oh! Wait.
Wait.
I have something to give you.
It is Scarlet Sunrise.
For your new friend.
Thank you, Lydia.
I'm sure Esme This will make her very happy.
I'm so glad.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Hey, you know, maybe one day the two of you could be friends.
I would rather eat my own hand.
I don't get it, Syd.
I mean, he took his lactose-intolerant girlfriend for pizza? [CHUCKLES] Clearly we have more work to do.
All right.
Keep you posted.
Papi? [DOOR CLOSES]
 [THEME SONG PLAYING] [BREATHES DEEPLY] Here she is! Ten fingers, ten toes.
[BABY GURGLING] Do we have a name for her yet? Elena Maria Alvarez Riera Calderon Leytevidal Inclan.
- So that's a yes.
- [CHUCKLES] Yeah.
Can't believe they're letting us take her home.
Last time I changed her diaper, I left my watch in there.
I know.
I heard her butt ticking and thought it was going to explode.
And then it did! Since you're recovering from a C-section, no intercourse for six weeks.
Six weeks? Six weeks! I don't know if I could wait six weeks.
Ooh.
Yep, I can.
I may never have sex again.
[SIGHS] Sorry, I was told that this room was empty.
This is usually where I come to cry.
Oh, look at your beautiful baby! Thank you.
They're so great at this age, before they can talk.
My girls, they're off in college.
That's nice.
Now my wife can yell at me in peace.
[CHUCKLES] Everything's fine.
Are you one of our doctors? - If you are, how do we get a new one? - [DR.
BERKOWITZ CHUCKLES] - That's funny.
- [CHUCKLES] I'm Doctor Leslie Berkowitz.
I'm a GP that works in the building.
But I love coming down to the maternity ward.
I find it so comforting.
Especially after I've lost a patient.
- Ugh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, don't worry.
He's very much alive.
He just hates me.
And now, here come the tears again.
I I'm just going to find a broom closet somewhere.
Everything's fine.
[CHUCKLES] Wow.
Yeah, I pity the sorry-ass nurse that has to work for that guy.
[BOTH LAUGHING] - All right.
You ready to go? - Wait.
What about the car seat? - I installed it perfectly.
- Okay.
- Your father reinstalled it.
- Of course.
And then your mother reinstalled it again.
And then they started arguing, and then they started making out.
When I left, they were salsa dancing in the parking lot.
[GRUNTS] You know what we need? A safe word.
For when our parents start invading our space.
We'll make it military so they don't understand.
- How about FUBAR? - Oh! My mom'll think it's a Chinese nightclub.
- Yes! - [GRUNTING] - Oh.
Does it hurt? - A little.
It's good.
[EXHALES SHARPLY] If this one ever gives me lip, I'll say, "They sliced me open, put all my organs on a plate just to get you out of me, so zip it.
" I like this.
You're the bad cop.
Which means I'm the good cop.
[SIGHS] I can't even imagine making this girl mad at me.
- Don't talk to me! - Calm down! - You're totally overreacting.
- Overreacting? Hey, hey! What's going on here? He's been lying about having a girlfriend.
[GASPS] Papito's gay too? I will be the only woman he's ever loved? Okay, I'm good.
No.
The "P" in his phone was Papi.
He's been sneaking around and seeing him.
What? Your papi's back in the country? Since when? About three weeks ago.
He has a month off and he's staying with TÃ­a.
You've been seeing him without telling me? It's not as bad as it sounds.
I knew you wouldn't like it, so I made up a girlfriend, then met Papi in secret so you wouldn't find out.
No, that's as bad as it sounds.
Papito, you're making me side with Elena, and it's very upsetting.
I'm not upset because you saw your father.
You should be able to see your father.
I'm upset because you lied to me.
Papi said it was easier this way.
You all hate him, so why make trouble? - This way everybody's happy.
- We are not happy! I should be smothering you with kisses right now, but instead I am frowning.
Ay, my lips are so confused! I thought you had my back.
You know what he did, but I guess you're fine with it, huh? - Elena - I will never forgive you for this.
[SIGHS] What are we supposed to do, Mom? Ignore him forever? [SPEAKING SPANISH] I have not spoken to my sister Mirtha for over 20 years.
What she did was unforgivable! You don't remember what it was, do you? She knows what she did.
Mirtha says she returned the mantilla, but I know she stole it.
I will never forget this as long as I live! Ay, mi vida, it is a piece of lace.
We will get you a new one.
[SIGHS] Pero, Berto, this shawl is from Spain! It belonged to my abuelita who stole it from her abuelita's sister.
Mi amor.
Put away your anger.
Let's focus on our beautiful granddaughter, and enjoy seeing our Lupita in the glow of motherhood.
[SPEAKS SPANISH] I may have just peed.
Anyway, I'm sorry I was gone so long.
I fell asleep in the lobby.
[SIGHS] Bueno, I cannot believe you took Elena out in public looking like that.
Mami, for the last time, a baby does not need earrings.
It is embarrassing! How will they know it's a girl? Perhaps the pink bow, pink blanket, pink cross around her neck And the earrings tie it all together! It only takes two minutes to pierce one ear.
It takes six minutes to pierce the other because they know what's coming.
- Get me a piece of ice and a safety pin.
- Papi, no! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Wassup? You guys are Mexican, right? I recognize the lingo.
Actually, we're Cuban, Sugar Ray.
I love Cuba! I've been there four times.
You guys get back a lot? No, we were forced to flee our homeland.
Respect.
Who are you? [CHUCKLES] Schneider, property manager.
Here are your keys.
Now don't get attached, job's just temporary.
- My father owns the building.
- [ALL EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH] Yeah, I'm just doing him a solid.
I'm really a musician.
Play a lot of rap-rock-ska.
I'm like a male Gwen Stefani.
A Glen Stefani.
How intriguing! - May I ask, do you speak Spanish? - Not a word.
Ah.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] I'm going to make sure we got all your boxes from the truck.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, cool baby! Wow.
How old is the little guy? - She is five weeks old - [BABY CRYING] and awake again.
Will someone tell my precious angel to go to sleep? I don't know why, but every time I put a dress on her, she spits up! So you're a single mom? Happily married to my husband who just got out of the army.
Yeah, I'm seeing somebody too.
We both just got out of the army.
My husband is starting up a security business with some of his buddies.
I'm going back to medical school to become a doctor.
Why am I telling you all these things? I'm so tired.
[SCOFFS] You just had a baby.
Ooh.
Word to the wise.
When you're hiring a nanny, make sure she's not too hot.
That's how I met my fifth mom.
So nice of you to stop by! [CHUCKLES] - Anyway, okay.
- [MOUTHING] Okay.
Yeah, hiring a stranger to watch my kid would bring shame to my people, so Okay, but I had four nannies and look at the results.
I promise you, that bobo will never set foot in this apartment again.
Ay, Mami, Mami, is she sleeping? Yes.
Caballero, por favor, let me.
Oye, chico, I got it.
I just got out of the army.
I'm strong.
I escaped Cuba.
I am stronger.
Yeah, you're both very macho.
Can you put the box of pillows over there, please? Hey.
I just talked to Brian and business is heating up.
- Good.
- This cell phone was a great investment.
Plus, I look cool.
Did the nurse say six weeks? 'Cause now it's seven.
Okay, I think we're good.
You guys can head home.
Hey, wait, this box says "Lydia's clothes" on it.
"Box one of 13"? It's time to talk.
Um Your mami and I have a proposal.
We're moving in with you.
What? Mi vida, you have to put it in the form of a question - so they think it's their decision.
- [GASPS] Oh, of course.
I am so sorry.
Are we moving in with you? Yes.
It's not enough that we're close by.
You need Double A, 24/7.
- "Double A"? - Abuelito and Abuelita.
[CHUCKLING] You are so clever.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] FUBAR! Okay, I mean, we could convert the dining room into a bedroom.
- Put up a curtain.
- What? A curtain? Never! A curtain is just a wall with no self-respect.
- You can take the bedroom next to ours.
- [LAUGHS] Victor, stop talking! What are you doing? They can't move in with us! And they definitely can't move into the bedroom next to ours, okay? They are very affectionate! Okay Look.
We said all that before we realized how hard this was.
I'm opening a business.
You're going to medical school.
Look how tired you are! I just have my eyes closed so I don't have to see that.
Hey.
What's the big deal? We're Cuban.
Literally everybody we know who has a baby lives with their parents.
'Cause I just wanted to be the first, you know? Like the first Cubans to go to the Moon.
- [CHUCKLES] - It's never happened before! [CHUCKLES] This will help us get on our feet, okay? It's an investment in our future.
[BABY CRYING] Okay.
But we are not living with them, they are living with us.
Whatever you need to tell yourself.
Hey, Double A's.
We have decided that you can move in with us.
A toast.
To you, Victor, my darling Lupita my sweet angel Elena.
Truly, today is the first day of the rest of your lives.
Gracias, Papi.
- Salud.
- Salud.
And I promise we will stay out of your hair and we will respect your boundaries.
- Gracias, Mami.
- Mm-hmm.
[COOS] Did you pierce Elena's ears? [LYDIA] She didn't even cry.
She was one tough baby.
I want to be mad, - but she looks so cute.
- Yeah.
[ALL USING BABY TALK] - She looks so cute.
- [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Okay, so I'm guessing you've figured out I've seen Alex a couple of times.
You thought it was okay to go behind my back and see him? I'm sure you would have liked it if I cleared it with you, but I'm only in town for a little while.
In my defense, I didn't think I'd get caught.
Victor, cut the crap and explain yourself.
It was just easier this way, okay? You don't want to see me, I don't want to see you, I got to see Alex.
He can't be sneaking around on me.
He's my son.
He's my son too.
I have a right to see him.
You do.
You also have a right to see your daughter.
She's not my biggest fan right now.
- Gee, why do you think that? - I know what I did.
I was mad! But I told you to keep this gay whatever thing between us! You parade her in front of my family and friends in a suit? Come on.
You were telling everybody.
[SCOFFS] I am not going to explain to you why all of that is so wrong.
Good.
I already heard it from Alex.
Well, good for him.
But even if you still have issues with me, what? You're just never gonna talk to your daughter again? Of course I will.
When? Because it's been almost a year.
[VICTOR SIGHS] I don't understand what happened.
Back when she was a baby, I have never seen a person love someone so much.
[BREATHES SHAKILY] [SINGING IN SPANISH] All right.
This isn't working out.
How about "Bootylicious"? Oh, my God, babe.
Have you heard of this thing called sleep? After you do it, you're not tired.
Big fan.
Highly recommend it.
Yeah.
[GASPS] And there's coffee too? I can get used to this.
Buenos dÃ­as, Lupe! - Well, now I don't need the coffee.
- [LYDIA LAUGHS] I just discovered this.
It is fantastic.
It makes everything so dramatic! [CHUCKLES] - I'm glad you're happy.
- I'm more than happy, Lupe.
This apartment is heaven.
I will never leave.
I like this thing too.
[BABY CRYING] Let me get her.
She must be hungry.
- Okay.
- [CRYING STOPS] - [VICTOR] All right, yeah.
- Okay.
I'll get breakfast too.
Although that looks good.
Yeah.
I'm real sexy right now.
Get out of here.
Okay, you eat, while Mommy finds out where in the world is Matt Lauer.
[KATIE COURIC] from Boston to Los Angeles, but we're just getting initial reports of that.
Again, we must tell you we're trying to get as much information but it is trickling in at a very slow pace.
So all of this is unconfirmed.
And, of course, speculation of a terrorist attack is unconfirmed, although that is what some Pentagon officials are saying.
Babe, come here.
- What's wrong? - Look at what's happening in New York.
[COURIC] Let's go to President Bush.
[PRESIDENT BUSH] Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America.
I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington None of us will ever forget this day.
Yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.
Thank you, good night, and God bless America.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] - Lupe, can I talk to you? - Yeah.
I spoke to Brian earlier.
- Does he know anything? - No, but he's re-enlisting.
Oh.
All right, you can run the business by yourself.
Lupe, I'm re-enlisting too.
[SIGHS] Yeah.
I have to.
I get what you're feeling, babe, and I'm feeling it too, but we had a plan.
Finish our service, get our careers going, and then start our family.
I know.
That was yesterday.
All the training, and the drills, and the sacrifice That was in case something like this happens.
- We have a five-week-old daughter.
- Yes, and she is why I'm doing this.
Look, she's so pure, and innocent, and perfect.
There's no way I'm gonna let her grow up in a world where that happens.
[SNIFFLING AND CRYING] If this turns into war, you're infantry.
And then you could Baby, baby, baby.
I have a responsibility to protect her future and her freedom.
That's what a soldier does.
And that's what a father does.
Okay? Then, I'm going to re-enlist too.
- No, you don't have to do that.
- I know.
But I want to.
We'll move back on post somewhere.
It's the best chance for all of us to be together.
Hopefully, this doesn't turn into anything.
But you're right.
We need to do this.
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] I don't think I can tell them.
I get it, but they'll understand.
They had parents that had to make difficult decisions so they could be free.
We're doing the same for Elena.
It's all about her.
Who knows where you and I might be if I think about that every day.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR] - Elena.
- Elena No.
It's my turn.
You know, I've thought a lot about what happened, and I'll spare you the details about the anger, and the crying, and the weight loss, and the empty space on my wall where your picture used to be.
[SIGHS] 'Cause I've decided that there's no point in focusing on the negatives.
I'd rather think about the good things that came from this.
Like, um [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You taught me a really valuable lesson.
Just because I'm gay, people will hate me without knowing anything else about me.
[BREATHES DEEPLY] [ELENA] I always knew that was part of the deal.
I just I never expected it from my own father.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] But now I know not to expect the best from anyone.
So, thanks, I guess.
Oh, and one more thing.
I learned some really cool stuff about myself.
Like I'm tough.
I'm really tough.
And when I do stumble, I have the most amazing mom who is always right there to pick me up.
So whatever, dude.
I'm moving on with my life.
I'm gonna be fine.
I'm just really bummed out for you.
[SNIFFLES] You're gonna miss stuff.
And that sucks.
'Cause I'm pretty great.
Yeah.
[VOICE BREAKING] Yeah, you are.
[WHISPERS] I'm sorry.
[VICTOR INHALES DEEPLY] - Abuelita, are there batteries in here? - Hmm? What is this? Some kind of shawl? [GASPS] No! No! It is not a long-lost mantilla from Spain that nearly ripped the family apart! I should call Mirtha.
Meh.
- Alex - What'd I do now? Everything.
[BREATHES DEEPLY] We just saw your papi.
He said you were trying to mend things between him and your sister.
Yeah.
I guess I did that.
Building bridges.
You know, Papi even said you called him a typical cisgender male.
- I couldn't be more proud.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So, is everything cool with you guys now? Mmm I don't know if we're cool, but we're talking.
That's a start.
Come here.
[CHUCKLES] [PENELOPE AND ELENA SIGH] Can everybody stop hugging me? SÃ­, back away.
I haven't had my turn.
DÃ¡melo.
My whole life has been your turn! [LYDIA CHUCKLES] You better get used to this.
I love you, dumdum! See, this makes me so happy.
I couldn't stand seeing you mad at each other.
You've always been so close.
[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] Hey.
[GASPS] Meet your new baby brother.
Alejandro Alberto Alvarez Riera Calderon Leytevidal Inclan.
I hate him! I don't want a baby brother! I want a puppy! Well, she better get used to it.
We're not getting a puppy.
 I can't believe you met when my mom treated you in Afghanistan.
- What was your injury? - I got shot in the face.
Dang! A tequila shot.
But it really burned.
And it got my shirt all wet.
My hero.
Thank you, Lydia.
If you were my medic, I would've faked an injury.
Stop it, Max.
Just kidding.
Don't.
Yeah.
Even though you are the embodiment of the alpha male, which normally I find [RETCHES] Looking at you up close with your chiseled features and your blue-green eyes with speckles of gold I get it.
I like it here.
Okay.
Can my mother and my daughter please stop trying to seduce my boyfriend? It's kind of annoying how easy it was for you to charm them.
[GROANS] I'm off my game.
Took me the whole dinner.
With you, it was three minutes of small talk, then, boom.
Okay, yeah.
I was there.
Yeah.
Well, it's your turn next week.
Elaine and Bernie Ferraro are excited to meet you.
Heads up, my dad's been listening to Spanish language tapes, so I'm not sure what that's gonna be.
My mother almost open-mouth kissed you, so the bar is low.
- [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - Oh.
I got it.
- "Pill time"? - Yeah.
That is a reminder for somebody.
Mami! [EXCLAIMS] Don't forget to take your pill! She's old, so she's got to take a lot of stuff.
She's forgetful, so the reminder's on my phone.
She doesn't know how to use this thing.
Okay.
So, Mami, you'll remember to take your pill, right? In the mouth this time? SÃ­.
SÃ­, of course.
I take pills because I am so forgetful.
Where am I? This is not Cuba.
- Okay.
- [PENELOPE] That's great.
- Okay, Mami, could you - Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
I don't want Max to know I'm on antidepressants.
Oh, pero, of course you don't want to tell him.
It's humiliating.
- It's not humiliating.
- Oh, no? Then I will tell him.
Oh, shut your mouth! Or I'll tell him you don't have eyebrows! [GASPS] Okay.
You got me by the cojones and I respect it.
Hey, how about we both go off our pills? And there will be so much more room in the medicine cabinet for rouge and lipstick.
Things we really need.
- Mami, your pills are to prevent a stroke.
- A stroke is all up here.
- You need to keep taking those pills.
- Okay! I'll stay a druggie.
- But I need some help.
Max? - Â¿SÃ­? I have to take a pill.
But as we both know, I am old and weak, so can you carry me to the bathroom? Okay.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] My panic attacks are starting to come at some weird places, y'all.
I don't get it, because when I was a gunner I made 100 decisions a second.
But yesterday, I was in the cookie aisle and I was sweating.
Too many options.
Next thing you know, I'm hyperventilating in a bag of Milanos.
Then I had to buy those.
- And I don't have no money for Milanos.
- [ALL LAUGH] Okay, this is why you need to keep using the coping tools we've been talking about.
Meditation, exercise, doing service Or maybe just stay out of the snack aisle, girl! [LAUGHS] I'm sorry, Pam.
Tools are great.
I don't even realize I'm in a bad place until I'm bingeing Keeping Up with the Kardashians and I'm weeping.
God! I feel bad for those people and I definitely should not.
Yes.
Sometimes our brains lie to us.
I knew I needed help when I heard a recording of myself played back.
I was wasted, slurring obscenities at a toaster about my abandonment issues.
I did the same thing! Except, instead of a toaster it was a cop.
Recording our thoughts is a very useful tool.
Hearing them played back gives you some perspective, as though someone else were talking.
So, like, "Hello, Penelope.
It's me, Penelope"? - That sounds stupid.
- Yeah, that sounds stupid, Pam.
Trust me.
It helps.
Wait, you haven't shared yet today, Penelope.
Which, for you, is unusual.
Well, I gotta be honest, guys, I'm feeling great.
And my toolbox is closed and under the bed.
Well, it's wonderful to hear that you're doing so well, but No, not just "well.
" Freaking fantastic! Like, school, work, the kids It's all amazing.
Plus, she's got a hot new boyfriend.
Speaking of tools gathering dust under my bed! [LAUGHS] Yes, girl, yes! But, no, no, no! Come on! He's more than that.
He is.
I'm actually gonna meet his parents next week.
And my family loves him.
And I'm gonna stop talking because it looks like Ramona might wanna punch me in the face.
You're not wrong.
But I'm happy for you.
- Hello! - Hi! Hello, Mami! Okay.
Are you going to put me in a home? - No, Mami, we don't do that.
- That's right! We don't! And if you ever do, papito has instructions to break me out.
Relax.
I just really need your advice on something.
Okay, mi vida.
What problem can I solve for you? Well, I'm meeting Max's parents soon and I want to make a good impression.
- So you want me to come? - No.
I need you to tell me what to wear! [LYDIA SPEAKS SPANISH] Okay.
This one shows off my tetas, this one shows off my nalgas, but we can find one that shows off both.
Ah, sÃ­! Give the people what they want! - [WHOOPS] - [BOTH LAUGH] Maybe we can go dress shopping Tuesday night.
Perfect! Oh, no! Isn't that when you're having your cuckoo party? You mean group therapy? Yeah, well, actually, I've decided to stop going.
[GASPS] If I hadn't been taking my medication like you told me to, I would be having a stroke.
- [CACKLES] - Come on! Therapy served its purpose and I'm really glad I did it, but I'm feeling like myself again.
Now I have more time for the kids and for you and me to hang out.
Let's go shopping! I might need a new lipstick.
- What's the matter? Are you tearing up? - [CRIES] You really are my daughter.
There was a period of ten seconds when the doctor took you out of the room and I have always wondered.
But no more! - [CRIES] - [CHUCKLES] - [PENELOPE] Thanks, Sister Barbara.
- Great CPR presentation, Mom.
Yeah, Mom, the presentation was amazing.
If this whole thing wasn't about saving lives, I'd say you killed it.
It could not have gone better.
Somebody asked me if I was your sister.
[CHUCKLES] Somebody asked if you were a sister.
As in of Christ.
Why do you feel the need to ruin people's joy? I went too far with the Sister Barbara joke.
No! Are you kidding? Everyone thought it was hilarious.
Yeah.
Even Sister Barbara laughed.
I had never seen her teeth.
I always assumed she had fangs.
It's not cool.
It's disrespectful.
Teachers have it hard enough, and then I make a joke at her expense? Like, "Great! Make a teacher feel bad about her job.
Nice work, Penelope.
" Mom, you did great.
Don't worry.
- I don't think before I speak.
- Who does that? Yeah, Mom, it's all good.
Let's go eat.
- We'll go get our stuff.
- Okay.
Mami, why don't you take the kids without me? - Huh? - Yeah.
I'm kinda amped up, and You know what? I'm gonna go for a run.
What? Why? I've wanted to get back into exercising and now I have time.
- I'm just gonna jog home.
- Now? Yeah! It's only a mile and a half.
- Oh, hey, Pen! - Hey.
Wow, you're all sweaty.
Oh, my God! If you joined an adult kickball team after saying you were too busy to join mine, you are on a long road to forgiveness.
- [SNIFFLES, PANTING] I went running.
- Is someone chasing you? - Oh, my God, are they still here? - What? No.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES] Max, stop.
I can't talk to you right now.
You don't want to talk to Max? What's wrong with you? Do you know how hard it is to get him on the phone? I've left like 60 voicemails.
I'm just in a weird mood.
I messed up the presentation at the kids' school, verbally abused a nun.
I'm adjusting to being off my meds.
I'm having caffeine late in the day.
I'm just a little stressed out.
Definitely want to hear about the verbal nun smackdown.
But you're off your meds? - Like your antidepressants? - Yeah.
Wow Your mom said you stopped going to therapy, but this, too, huh? So your doctor thought you were ready or Didn't do it through my doctor.
It was time.
It's fine.
Sure, sure, sure.
But is that really a DIY situation? I'm a nurse.
I know what I'm doing.
Do you know you just ran a 5K in scrubs? Why am I talking to you about this anyway? Your idea of stress is when your chest waxer goes out of town.
Roberto is the only one who doesn't make it sting! I would kill to have your problems.
Too much money, too much free time, too many parents.
I know you're upset, but you don't have to take it out on me.
- Please.
- Hey.
I've been around enough to know when people are not okay, and you don't seem okay.
I get where you're coming from.
You have no idea where I'm coming from! You've had everything handed to you! You had to get hooked on drugs just to be interesting! You don't sound like yourself.
I'm gonna go.
[LYDIA CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS] Lupita, wake up.
I'm up.
Bueno, it's 7:45.
Did you forget to set your alarm? I'm not gonna go to work today, 'cause I don't feel well.
[SCOFFS] Â¿Y? I once went to work with a temperature of 104.
I was delirious and no one even noticed a difference.
I can miss work for one day, Mami.
You don't feel fever-y.
I don't feel well.
I know my body.
Please, just let me sleep.
Okay, mija.
I made you some sopa with fideos.
I'm not hungry.
Okay.
Let's cure this once and for all.
This cannot be cured with Vicks VapoRub.
Everything can be cured with Vicks VapoRub! It cured your TÃ­a Neni's appendicitis.
Her appendix was removed.
Who's to say which treatment helped her the most? I'm gonna go back to sleep, Mami.
I'm tired.
[SPEAKS SPANISH, SIGHS] I'll leave this right here.
Good, you're up! I hemmed your dress so it's ready for tonight! It's sexy but not too sexy.
Max's father will love you and his mother will still respect you.
[SPEAKS SPANISH] What is wrong? Por favor.
I shouldn't have bought that dress.
It was stupid.
I spent too much money.
Now it's hemmed, and I can't take it back.
No, it's okay.
You deserve a nice dress.
No, I don't.
[EXHALES DEEPLY] I can't do this.
I'm not gonna go tonight.
What? Tell me what to do.
Let me help you.
You can't help me.
I don't understand what's happening.
Everything is so good! I mean, papito is perfection.
Elena is very smart.
Max is an Adonis who loves you.
And then there is me! Your life is full of blessings.
[SHAKILY] I know.
Mami, believe me! I know! Please, could you just leave me alone? Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It has been a week since my last confession.
There is something wrong with my daughter.
And I don't know what happened.
She was doing so well that she stopped going to therapy, finally.
Things have never been better between my daughter and me.
And now I can't get her out of bed! - Did you try the Vicks VapoRub? - [SCOFFS] Of course! So your daughter is depressed? Oh, oh, yes, yes.
She's even taking medication for it.
You know, I don't understand these things.
Depression, anxiety, OCD I was just thinking about them the other night when I got up at 3:00 a.
m.
to do my makeup and clean the sponges.
Well, just because you don't feel those things, uh, doesn't mean they aren't real for her.
I wish I could take away her pain and feel it for myself.
That is what mothers are for.
SeÃ±ora, taking on someone else's suffering is not possible.
But is that not what Jesus did? Okay.
Good point.
I mean, you can't know and fix everything, including your daughter.
You can only be there for her while she fixes herself.
Thank you, Padre JosÃ©.
I will try.
Good.
And remember, you are not God.
Ay I know that is true, but it's still hard to hear.
Hello, Penelope.
It's me, Penelope.
[SCOFFS] [SIGHS] This is so stupid.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR] Oh, hi.
You here to yell at me more? Maybe insult one of my mothers? Whoa.
Whoa.
Hey! Hey.
What's going on? I did this thing where I recorded myself thinking out loud.
Can you just listen with me, please? [OVER SPEAKERS] Hello, Penelope.
It's me Penelope.
[SCOFFS] This is so stupid.
Isn't it so weird to hear your own voice out loud? You want me to listen to the whole thing and then comment? Gotcha.
[PENELOPE OVER SPEAKERS] I can't sleep.
It literally feels like the weight of my life is sitting on my chest.
[EXHALES] And then I see those kids [EXHALES] Those beautiful kids and I'm so tired.
Maybe too tired to be what they need.
[CRYING] I want so badly for them to grow up and live full, happy lives.
But I can't teach them how to do that because I don't know how to do that myself.
I'm failing them.
I'm failing them.
They deserve so much better than me.
It's like when people tell me, "Be happy.
You have a great life.
" It makes me feel like garbage because I know.
But what's wrong with me that I can't appreciate that? That I can't feel it? And what's the point of living if you can't feel anything? [SIGHS] You were right.
That woman is not okay.
I know what the last part sounds like, but I promise I would never do anything like that.
I know.
But I think you know that healthy brains don't go to that place.
[SIGHS] You need to go back on your meds.
I don't want to be on a drug for the rest of my life! I shouldn't have to need it! I shouldn't have to need these either, but I do.
To see.
And to look rugged but also smart.
- It's not the same thing.
- Oh, no? Okay.
Wanna go for a drive? There's got to be another way to feel happy.
[SIGHS] So it's Fourth of July, 2011.
I'd been sober for a while, so I thought I'd celebrate with a beer.
Woke up three days later in an alley.
Then the bowling ball hit me.
I was in the gutter for a long time.
It's really slippery without the shoes.
That was the day I truly accepted that I can't have alcohol or drugs, ever.
Not a beer, not a glass of wine, not even six hits of acid at a Grateful Dead show, no matter how well it makes me dance.
I kinda get where you're coming from.
There's something I want that I can't have for the rest of my life.
And there's something you don't want that you have to have for the rest of yours.
[SHAKILY] I'm really sorry about all the crap I said to you.
Ah! I can take it.
We're best friends.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, man! I think you might actually be my best friend.
Now I'm really depressed.
- Hello.
- Ay, Mami! Jesus! Mami, I thought you were a ghost.
Please, you cannot see ghosts.
You do not have the gift.
Why are you still awake? [SCOFFS] I was worried about you.
Plus, the kitchen sink is not going to Fabuloso itself.
Are you feeling better? Not yet, but I'm gonna be.
Oh? So, not only did I stop going to therapy, but I also went off my meds a few weeks ago.
But I'm gonna go back on them.
And I'm going back to therapy.
I know my Cuban brain should be able to fight off the crazy like a matador in a bullfight or whatever.
But, Mami, I really I don't want to hear it.
Okay.
What? You do what you need to do to fix yourself.
And I will be here for you.
Hold on.
Is this some sort of reverse psychology? [SCOFFS] No.
I do not believe in psychology.
For me.
Thank you, Mami.
I love you, nena, and I just want you to be happy.
Hi! Got your text.
Glad your phone works.
Could've been useful two days ago when you stood up my parents.
My dad still insisted on ordering in Spanish.
We did not get what we wanted.
I hope you'll let me explain and make it up to you physically.
You have the floor.
I need to tell you something.
After you hear it, you can decide whether or not you still wanna be with me.
What is it? You have kids and live with your mom? 'Cause those are deal-breakers.
That [SIGHS] And I have depression and anxiety.
And I take medication for it.
And if I don't take the medication, it's not good.
You're a veteran.
Maybe you get it, maybe you don't.
That's what happened when I stood you up.
I tried to go off and [INHALES SHARPLY] Anyway, the meds help me stay in control of my life.
I'll probably have to be on them forever.
Okay.
So what's the thing that would make me not wanna be with you? 'Sup, bestie? Oh Making out with other bestie.
It's so awkward when your two best friends start dating.
What do you guys wanna do tonight? Oh, I got it.
Why don't all three of us Netflix and chill? [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Papito, taste the pollo con ajo.
My abuelita taught me how to make this when I was a little girl.
The key is to add just a little bit of cigar ash.
My abuelita used to put Vicodin in her coffee.
And her lemonade and her sandwiches.
Maybe she had a problem.
Okay, I'm finished.
No more leak.
Wow.
Nice work.
As my father said to me on my ninth birthday, "You don't need me anymore.
" By the power vested in me - by the Guild of the Custodial Arts - Not a thing.
It is a thing.
I'm the president.
I dub thee handyman.
Eh, check this out.
I was actually thinking "Handy ma'am.
" Oh, my [BOTH MIMIC EXPLOSIONS] Mami, where have you been? I've been cooking these frijoles for 20 minutes.
Ugh, I try to make a house a home.
I was driving in freaking circles, looking for a spot.
I had to park by the lake again and get chased by the geese.
That big one either hates me or is in love with me.
Either way, I don't like it.
- Why don't you just park in your garage? - What? - We don't have a garage.
- Yeah, you do.
It's part of the lease.
I figured you were using all the garages for storage.
Don't be ridiculous.
I use my garage for pickling and sea horse breeding.
Anyway, of course you have a garage.
It's downstairs.
It's [GROANS] Oh There seems to be a misunderstanding.
See, um [CLEARS THROAT] Little parched.
Let me just hydrate here.
[GULPING] Why did I not know I had a garage? I may have put a few things in there.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] [SCOFFS] I cannot believe that you've been hiding this from me all this time.
Oh? I thought I had mentioned it.
It rained for 17 days in a row this winter.
I walked from my car every night! Oh, I wish you had told me that.
There's a box of raincoats somewhere.
Whatever, Mami, I am too excited to argue.
Now I don't have to keep those traffic cones in my trunk to fake out my parking competition.
- Does that work? - When I wear my yellow vest, it does.
Come on, everybody, let's get this junk out of here so I can park my car! No, no! This is not junk.
I need everything here.
Really, Mami? You need a whole box of gardening gloves? We don't even have a garden.
What if papito wants to be Michael Jackson for Halloween? [IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON] I'll be Spider-Man.
There are, like, four boxes of dusty old magazines.
We could at least recycle them.
Instead of your own abuelita, you think of the planet? So you just keep your filthy green hands off my Vanidades magazines.
What about all this fabric? Come on! There must be something in here we can get rid of.
There is.
I'm not letting this go, Mother.
I'm done parking ten blocks away and being chased through the park by the geese! Ay, Lupita, relax, huh? Ah, mira.
Put this on and the geese will not chase you when they see what you have done to their friends.
Okay.
I will get rid of some stuff and papito will help me.
You make sure she does it.
Ooh.
[CHUCKLES] I'mma keep this.
Okay, your first solo mission as a handy ma'am.
Apartment 301.
Herb and Sherb McGurb.
Sherb? Her real name is Sheryl, but she gets a kick out of Sherb.
Ha-ha.
Hello, Herb, Sherb.
Schneider.
[GIGGLES] This is Elena Alvarez, my handyman mentee.
Or handy-manatee.
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.
This is her first job, but don't worry.
I taught her everything I know.
- So, you good? You got your plunger? - Yes.
- Got your toilet snake? - Yes.
- Got your snack? - I'm not going to eat a snack while I plunge and snake a toilet.
The toilet is a cruel mistress.
[SIGHS] She is flush with complications.
She's ready.
Oh, oh, one more thing.
You're gonna see a glass in there with teeth in it.
No matter how much you're tempted, do not put them in your mouth.
So, did you get rid of some stuff? Even better than that.
No.
Papito helped me arrange everything so there's plenty of room for your car.
A little to the left.
[EXCLAIMING] [SPEAKS SPANISH, LAUGHS] Perfecto.
Can the garage door even shut? Uh, kind of.
See? Now back up so I can get out.
Hey, Schneider.
[SHUSHES] [SIGHING] What's up? So this is what Schneider looks like at his most Schneider-y.
Since when do you do bonsai? [SCOFFS] Bonsai's for dorks.
This is penjing.
The gentle Chinese art of tray scenery.
Now that you're working for me, I finally have some leisure time.
Oh, look, there's little people.
Wait, is that my family? Could be any Cuban family.
I just came to tell you that I'm done fixing the McGurbs' toilet.
What? You were there for 20 minutes.
It's at least an hour-and-a-half job.
For you, maybe.
You must have done something wrong.
Actually, I noticed you just replaced the flapper, which is more of a Band-Aid.
So I went ahead and installed a pressure assist flush valve and now it's fixed for good.
You must have done something wrong.
Look, it's nothing against you.
I'm just a really quick learner.
Maybe I could help you be better.
[STAMMERS] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I am the mentor here, Little Miss Thang.
I may only look two or three years older than you, but I have the wisdom of that ancient bonsai! - You just said - It's all the same stuff! [SCOFFS] Was that me? Not every gay, teenage, Cuban girl figurine is you! Well, my car got hit! - [GASPS] No! - Are you okay? Yes, because I wasn't in it.
I was about to leave and I noticed that somebody clipped it because I had to park it with its big ol' butt sticking out of the garage! Oh, I was afraid of this.
The garage does not like you.
So, it's taking out its revenge.
Mami, no.
I've had it.
Now we have to spend money we don't have to fix the car.
Enough is enough.
You have to get rid of your junk.
As a matter of fact, I already did.
Alex, is that true? Uh Of course it is true.
I cleared out the exercise bicycle.
The lawn chair.
Even my old fabrics.
And you said there was no room for these things.
[CHUCKLES] Don't you feel foolish? [SIGHS] - You wanted to see me? - Yeah.
- You're fired.
- What? Why? I got a call from the McGurbs.
Herb is very perturbed.
You've worked on that all day, haven't you? Don't be absurd! Herb said that they don't want you working at their apartment anymore because they didn't like your attitude.
What? That's crazy.
I was completely polite and professional.
Yeah.
Those aren't the words Herb used.
For a pastor, he knows some salty language.
Anyway, walk me through everything you did while you were there.
Okay.
Well, they offered me some lemonade, and I said, "No, thank you " What? Always take the lemonade.
That's Handyman 101! [GROANING] Oh, my God! Okay.
So you watched Jeopardy with them and then what? Why would I watch TV with them? I just fixed their stuff and left.
[HYPERVENTILATING] Well, now we know what your problem is! You fixed their toilet, but you didn't fix their souls.
- Is that some kind of Chinese proverb? - Probably.
[SIGHS] Elena, growing up, I had everything.
But I was always alone.
I don't want my tenants to feel that way, so I, I do more than just fix stuff.
Apartment 306, macramÃ© with Mrs.
Watson.
201, lose at chess to Mr.
Roth.
- 402, listen to all their Cuban nonsense - Excuse me? That's the job.
That's what takes four hours.
[SIGHS] That's the difference between being a handyman and a super.
Understand? Yeah, I guess.
I feel bad.
Should I go apologize to the McGurbs? Uh, during NCIS? Don't make it worse.
Okay, I feel weird.
My heart's beating out of my chest, my upper lip is sweating, and I feel like hiding and trimming a tiny tree.
Is this what failure is? Hey, hey, hey.
I know you'll do it right next time.
And there will be a next time.
So, I'm not fired? Nah, I just said that to be dramatic.
It's cool, right? Never said it before.
And I've heard it a lot.
Check it out.
Abuelito's guayabera almost fits me.
Ay, papito, you look so handsome! Just like your abuelo.
- [SOBS] - Abuelita, are you okay? [VOICE BREAKING] Just happy tears, papito.
Happy tears.
[SNIFFLES] Lots of very good memories.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Aww.
It's my mom, holding hands with my son, who's dressed as my dad.
That's not weird.
Don't listen to her.
You could be a model.
[LAUGHING] And you know what? We could be in a JCPenney catalog.
Hello.
I always loved Papi in this.
He always looked so elegant.
Ah.
Nobody wore a guayabera like your Papi.
Okay, Mami, I can see how keeping some of this stuff around might be nice.
Ay, thank you, Lupita.
You know, I was thinking about what you said and perhaps I don't have to keep everything.
Ah? [EXCLAIMS] I'm so glad to hear you say that, Mami.
Alex, bring up the Vanidades magazines so I can look through them and decide which to keep.
Actually, Mami, why don't you start with your VHS tapes of The Love Boat? Who died and made you Captain Stubing? We start with the magazines.
What? Okay.
So I didn't think you'd be reasonable about this so I took your Vanidades to the thrift store.
[GASPS] Mami, you were being impossible! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Ay, por favor, Mami, stop being dramatic.
It's not that big of a deal.
I hid my savings bonds in the pages of one of those Vanidades to keep them safe.
What? They were going to mature soon.
And I was going to use the money to help me with Elena's college and papito's Barbizon Modeling School.
Mami, why didn't you keep them somewhere safe? Oh, you mean keep them in a secret garage, where even my own daughter didn't know for two decades? Ah, silly me.
I didn't see anything like that.
Come on.
There's no way you sold four boxes of dusty, old Spanish magazines in two hours.
I just sold a guy a used retainer.
Can you please check again? - Of course.
- Thank you.
Nope.
Oh, you want to play hardball? Okay.
Alex, how about we try on a bunch of clothes and put none of them back on the hangers and leave this place a freakin' disaster? This is a charity store for cancer patients.
I did not know that.
Look, if they're not in the store, they might be in the dumpster out back.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I am so sorry for what I said.
I am a nurse.
I love cancer patients.
So, out back? Okay.
Okay, hop in and find the magazines.
What? I'm not going in there.
This is how most Law & Orders start.
Well, I'm not going in there.
But you're always talking about how strong you are.
"Oh, I'm a badass!" You know why you should go in there? I am a badass.
Ah.
I am sorry you are sad about your job.
Let The Love Boat set its course for happiness.
- Pretty progressive - Mmm.
that Julie, the cruise director, was so openly gay.
[SPUTTERS] What? Huh? All right, Mami, we got the Vanidades! [SPEAKING SPANISH] - Did you get all of them? - [PENELOPE] Yeah.
[LAUGHS] Okay, I'll start dinner.
Wait, where are you going? We have to find your savings bonds! Everybody, grab a stack and start looking.
Mami, come on.
Let's find the bonds! There are no bonds.
Excuse me? The things you're looking for? They do not exist.
Ha-ha! You You lied to me? Do you think if I had secret money I would be shopping at Marshalls? The answer is yes.
I love Marshalls.
And I would shop there even more.
But what about my college? You'll get a student loan.
- What about my modeling school? - You'll get a scholarship.
Are you freaking kidding me right now? Don't mess with my stuff.
We spent the day in a dumpster! "We"? You threw away tu mami's most cherished cositas! Oh, I'm about to drop a match in mi mami's most cherished cositas! And I'm about to take a baseball bat to your precious car! Try me, vieja.
Ooh, ooh I will.
And I have six bats to choose from in the garage.
Wood, Wiffle, metal Mami.
I work my nalgas off to support this family, and I deserve a place to park my car! And besides, you never use any of this stuff anyway.
You pack it away forever! Some of them are for special occasions! Oh, like the precious china we've never even seen? I was keeping it safe for you, to pass it down to Alex and Elena, so they could pass it down to their children! Why don't we pass down an empty box that says "China"? It'll be lighter! Mami, you have a problem.
There is an entire television show devoted to people like you.
I know, and it's called Dancing with the Stars and it is fabulous! I meant Hoarders.
It is a sickness to keep worthless things.
I came to America with nothing! - All is valuable when you have nothing! - I get it [STAMMERS] But this broken lawn chair? A cracked teapot? Mami, what is this? This ratty, used umbrella.
Mami, what kind of value could this possibly have? I was at the park with your papi one day.
We were having a picnic to cheer him up because he had lost his job.
He was so worried about money, and I knew that the news I had to give him would not help.
So [INHALES DEEPLY] I took a big swig of rum and a slow drag on my cigar, and I told him I was pregnant with you.
It was the '70s! Anyways, it began to rain.
And Berto opened this and put it over us.
And he said, "I will always protect you, mis vidas.
" And that was the first moment we spent as a family, under this umbrella.
That's beautiful, Mami.
You want to know what papi and I did on this lawn chair? No.
It may sound silly, but even those old magazines mean something to me.
Because it was all I could read when I got here, because they were in Spanish.
And they made me feel like a girl again, instead of just an exile.
[SIGHS] So, what do we do? You want to keep these things that matter to you, I need to park my car without being bitten by a goose.
I don't know how to fix this.
I think I do.
[EXCLAIMS] Elena, these shelves are amazing.
Ay, sÃ­.
They solve everything! [SIGHS] Ooh, and I didn't just build shelves in the garage, I built shelves in their souls.
That only works for toilets.
But I'm proud of you.
What you did here is really super.
Ooh, and I made us something.
I'm pretty excited about it.
[GRUNTS] Bam! We have handy caps! Yeah, we gotta talk about our branding.
How about I make us all some dinner to celebrate? - [GASPING] And we can eat it on the china.
- Ooh.
Okay.
Ooh, Lydia, I think we moved the china to the other garage.
Other garage?
 Lupe, Max will be here soon.
Have you finished packing for your romantic vacaciÃ³n? Almost.
But we're gonna have to stop at the outlet mall on the way to Palm Springs because the only desert wear I have is this.
You need clothing? What kind of romantic vacaciÃ³n is this? - The kind that won't get us arrested.
- That happened one time.
Ay, Elena, your homecoming dance is only 36 hours away.
If I pluck your eyebrows with both hands I may be able to separate them in time.
School dances are barbaric events designed to make less popular kids feel bad.
They're for total narcissists.
Okay, eyes on me.
How fly are my vintage threads for the dance? [PENELOPE] Ooh.
Papito, you look so handsome in your abuelo's outfit.
- Who did you decide to go with? - This older girl, Emma.
She's older.
By two months.
Okay.
Well, she had an epic big ask.
It is not polite to talk about your girlfriend's fondillo, no matter how big it is.
No, Abuelita.
"Big ask.
" It's the way kids invite each other to dances now.
It's a whole obnoxious performance.
I am so glad Syd is home-schooled and not into this stuff.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, hey, Syd.
What's happening? I don't know, but I think Syd is wearing their grandpa's outfit too.
["WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE" KARAOKE PLAYING ON PHONE] [SNAPPING FINGERS] [SINGING] Harriet Tubman, Mass Effect Frida Kahlo, full respect Queer theory, gender theory Notorious RBG Women's march, science march Labor march Tax march, equal rights, Bathroom rights Diversity on TV Do we have to watch the rest of this? That is a big ask.
Slam poets, Supergirl You're the cutest in the world Bell hooks, PokÃ©mon Cookie Om-nom-nom-nom-nom! L Word, Will and Grace RuPaul's Drag Race Shantay, you stay What else do I have to say? You set my heart on fire On that day When I didn't know if you were gay You set my heart on fire So please say yes You don't even have to wear a dress Will you go to the dance with me? [GIGGLES] Yes! Of course I'll go! - What? But I thought you said - Shut up! [THEME SONG PLAYING] I am ready.
I thought we were going away for the weekend, but are we moving to Palm Springs? No.
This one's empty.
Yeah.
It's for the mini shampoos and soaps we're gonna snag from the hotel.
And this is for the free breakfast we're gonna swipe so we don't have to spend money on lunch.
I'll pay for lunch.
Maybe even splurge for Quiznos.
Damn, I didn't know I was dating a rich guy.
[SCOFFS] Plus he is charming, he's sexy, he's tan.
He claims to be a gringo, but all signs point to cubano.
- [CHUCKLES] - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Don't answer, it's probably another bad singer.
[LAUGHS] Little privacy here? You knocked! Oh, yeah.
Nikki has some stuff she wants to tell you.
[BOTH CLEAR THROAT] As an active member of the St.
Bibiana PTA, and presidential candidate "Don't be picky, vote for Nikki.
" It is my duty to inform you you failed to complete your mandatory family volunteer hours.
- You done? [CHUCKLES] - Yeah.
Oh, stop that! I'm sorry.
I'll make the hours up soon, okay? Okay, but Uh-uh.
The deadline is Sunday.
But lucky you! I'm short on chaperones for homecoming tomorrow.
Come get your salsa on, chica.
That's not convincing me.
But I can't, because we're going to Palm Springs.
So you can just pay the fine.
It's $50 an hour.
And you're behind 20 hours.
So it's $1,000, no bigs.
What? I don't have that kind of money.
I packed these so we could soft boil them in the Jacuzzi.
I guess I'll see you at homecoming then.
It counts for five hours.
Bye! [CHUCKLES] I'm not voting for her.
- [POP SONG PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Whoa! School-schools are way bigger than home schools.
I can't believe it has its own ballroom.
This is a gym.
What? I'm gonna hit the restroom.
I cannot wait to meet all of your friends.
All of your friends? Yeah, so, um Syd kinda thinks I'm really popular.
[CHUCKLES] Oh Wow! Love really is blind.
Why would Syd think you're popular? - You're only friends with the teachers.
- And the principal! I just I maybe didn't correct some false assumptions.
Syd knows I'm president of a lot of clubs and it's not my fault people hate powerful women.
The same thing happened to Hillary.
You can't say that about everything.
- Okay, how will you pull this off? - With this.
I can skim Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat and find a few facts about these ding-dongs to make it seem like we're friends.
I'm gonna talk to my actual friends, but I'm gonna leave you with this thought.
Maybe you're the ding-dong.
I'm sorry we're not sippin' margaritas by a pool right now.
I had my blender packed and everything.
So that was the buzzing coming from your suitcase.
- I was worried slash excited.
- Oh! Well, thank you for doing this.
With your five hours, my mom's five hours, I'm almost caught up.
Happy to be here.
[GRUNTS] God! This place takes me back.
My first homecoming dance, Sister Barbara caught me hiding boxed wine in my top.
She did not buy "My boobs are square.
" [LAUGHS] It's like she had a way of sneaking up and yelling at me with her demonic voice.
- Hello, Penelope.
- [EXCLAIMS IN SPANISH] Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Sister Barbara.
That's a very red dress.
And also, I see your bosoms have rounded out.
[LAUGHS] Oh We had our fun, didn't we, Sister Barbara? I know I was a bad girl, but I'm a nurse now.
And I was in the army.
I turned out pretty okay.
Oh, that's nice.
Pride is a sin.
You know, all chaperones are required to wear black.
Did you receive my e-mail? I sent it through the Internet.
Oh, I don't use e-mail.
That's the devil's work.
[CHUCKLES] No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
Anyway.
I This is Max.
Thank you for helping out today, Max.
Oh, bless.
Is he simple? Well, the Lord made you strong.
[SCOFFS] What the hell was that? Sorry, I have a thing for nuns.
- You do? - Yeah.
Small women that boss you around, make you do stuff.
Hot.
Why do you think I like you so much? [CHUCKLES] Hello, Sister Barbara.
Blessed be the fruit.
I'd like to introduce you to Schneider, my boyfriend.
Yep, I'm her boyfriend, which is not news to me.
We're not married yet, but we've promised ourselves to each other.
Wonderful.
Is everyone ready for their assignments? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey.
How about if Max and I do dance patrol? We all know what goes on in the middle of a dance floor.
The farther you are from the chaperones, the freakier the freakin' gets.
We have a strict anti-freaking policy.
I don't think the situation would be helped by you in that dress.
Well, I don't have another dress, so what do we do? Hey, Mom.
This is Emma.
Emma? Your teenage date? Nice to meet you.
How is she in ninth grade? Was she held back? Like, nine times? Seems like it, right? Let's get a picture.
[SIGHS] - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - Next! Oh.
Don't worry, guys, I'm here! Hey, Connor.
Remember when you had so much fun in Cancun in 2007? [CHUCKLES] I mean, you pet a stingray? Crazy! Elena, how come I never met these guys? You don't know my life.
Just take the picture.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - Got it.
- Hi, I'm Syd Okay.
Tag me when you post it.
Jay-Z is your favorite artist.
You guys want one without her? [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Oh.
Hello? I cannot stop looking at you in that nun outfit.
- It is a choir robe.
- Eh, I can make it work.
See, this sucks.
I like to be near you when you're being pervy.
Oh, I gotta go.
Okay.
I love you.
You what? Hello? What? What? What? Oh, hi, Penelope.
Hey, Doc.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
You're my last five hours.
Of course.
I have never been to a school dance before.
My mother was afraid I'd contract mononucleosis.
I never did.
Aw [CHUCKLES] Could you take over the photo booth for a minute? - I need to talk to Max.
- Sure.
Finally, I get to hang with the cool kids.
Like this guy.
- Lupe? - What? Why is Leslie here? Is he stalking me? I asked him to come help finish my hours.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You said you were okay with him dating someone new.
Of course I'm okay.
It's him I am worried about.
I mean, seeing me look this fabulous? It is so cruel.
Where are you going? Mami, I think I just heard Max say he loves me.
- Why are you still standing here? Run! - [CHUCKLES] - Pen! - What? Oh, thank God.
Did you hear what Nikki said to Sister Barbara? - She thinks I'm her boyfriend? - I can't stress how little I care.
I know! I can't stop thinking about it either.
On one hand, Nikki is a terrible person.
On the other hand, is it time for me to get married? [SIGHS] Excited to see this next chapter of your life unfold.
Bye! Hello, you.
Hey.
I'm just keeping an eye on Alex and his date.
He got pulled into the booty-dancing jungle and a loose woman told me that's where the freaking takes place.
Hey, good looking out.
I wanted to ask, when we hung up you said something [UPBEAT SONG PLAYING] This is my jam! But wait Oh, damn! This is my jam too! It takes two to make a thing go right It takes two to make it outta sight It takes two to make a thing go right Oh.
Hi, Sister Barbara.
Why have you abandoned the photo booth? The children are taking pictures of their rear ends.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was I was just keeping an eye on the dance floor.
You know, showing the kids what not to do.
Yeah.
Hey, kids, don't do this.
[GRUNTING] I do not like it! Elena! - Hey, Mrs.
Wallace.
- What up, girl? Hey, how is your Susan B.
Anthony claymation coming along? Thank you for texting me all those updates.
[EXCLAIMS] You are really capturing her handsome severity.
- You're friends with your teacher? - No! She does this.
It's weird.
I'm friends with her! Hey, Suehee! Do I know you? Girl, your one-year anniversary since your braces came off? Hashtag, time flies.
- Let's just go dance over here.
- By the trash? Yeah.
I need some empty space to pop and lock.
[TANGO MUSIC PLAYING] Finally.
My request.
Hello, Leslie.
How is Esme? The woman whose name I refuse to mention.
Well, Esme and I actually have been taking dance classes.
Oh, really? Well, I guess she ruined you as a dancer.
She did not.
I was already ruined.
It's not her fault that She's so irresistible But all the damage she's caused Isn't fixable Every 20 seconds you repeat her name But when it comes to me We can't.
It is forbidden.
Objection I don't want to be the exception To get a bit of your attention I love you for free And I'm not your mother But you don't even bother Objection Oh, this used to be my spot.
All my best bad girl stuff was done here.
[CHUCKLES] I'm just glad we escaped Sister Barbara's sexy clutches.
Now that we are alone, I wanted to ask you something.
Earlier, on the phone, I thought I heard you say "I love you"? Yeah.
I did.
Why'd you say that? 'Cause I love you.
Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to choreograph that to a Billy Joel song? No.
Boyz II Men.
I wasn't planning on telling you at a school dance, across the room, on the phone.
But I've been thinking about it for a while and there you were in that sexy nun outfit.
- [CHUCKLES] - [SIGHS] What can I say? The power of Christ compelled me.
I wasn't planning on telling you in a stinky choir robe that smells like incense and Fritos.
- But you were planning on telling me? - At dinner in Palm Springs over a beautiful bottle of wine I won on the radio.
- Tell me what, exactly? - Come here.
I love you too.
Oh You know what I could use right now? Here? - Okay.
- [GASPS] Oh, I can't believe they're still here.
[GASPS AND LAUGHS] Whoa! Are you sure you want to do that? Those are 20 years old.
And they're cigarettes.
Hey, as long as I'm being a bad girl Oh, yeah.
[COUGHING] God! Why did I ever like this? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Sister Barbara! What do you need to talk about that's so important? After a grueling 30 minutes of thought Nikki, will you be my starter wife? Schneider, I don't wanna get married.
I just got divorced.
You're on the rebound.
That's the best time to get married.
You don't have time to think.
Aw, that's so stupid.
But what about all that boyfriend stuff you said to Sister Barbara? I was trying to impress her.
I'm running for PTA president.
Hello? I told everybody else you were my manny.
So you were never thinking about me? My emotions? My feelings? - Oh, God, no.
- [GASPS] You used me, Nikki, Finn's mom! And not in the way I like! Oh Ew.
Kids are so gross.
Smoking in the hallway? And that's not all, Sister Barbara.
We knew each other.
Biblically.
And while we were doing it, she took the Lord's name in vain.
A lot! [UPBEAT SONG PLAYING] Whoo! I am all popped and locked out.
- And look at that, it's almost 10:00.
- It's 8:30.
And you're not wearing a watch.
Look.
I know why you haven't introduced me to any of your friends.
- You do? - Yeah.
You're embarrassed of me.
What? No, no, no.
I'm not embarrassed of you.
I'm embarrassed of me.
I don't have very many friends.
Like, if I were to count them, I wouldn't say any numbers.
- This, it really isn't my thing.
- Then why did you say yes? You were so excited.
And your big ask was amazing.
You must have worked on that song for forever.
Actually, I just really got in the zone.
The lyrics were sort of writing me, you know? I pretended that these people were my friends, but, honestly, for some reason, I'm not that popular.
Hey, planet killer! Recycle that! I don't know what it is exactly.
I'm sorry I let you believe I was someone I'm not.
[SIGHS] Elena, I'm home-schooled.
My only classmate is my chinchilla.
[CHUCKLES] And Roxie's a total mean girl.
I don't care that you don't have any friends.
Aw I don't care that you don't have any friends.
[BOTH CHUCKLING] We should probably make some friends.
Actually, I do have one friend here at the dance.
I haven't been kind to her tonight.
Hey, Mrs.
Wallace.
Elena.
I want you to meet my girlfriend, Syd.
Syd, this is my friend.
Mrs.
Wallace.
- I'm really sorry.
- I get it.
I was a teenager once.
Of course, I didn't have teachers as cool as me.
[BOTH CHUCKLING] Ooh, can we have this dance? Uh, yeah.
Let's show these losers how it's done.
Time after Sometimes you picture me I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me I can't hear what you've said Lydia.
Esme and I broke up.
Oh, Leslie, I am sorry.
How dare she! Esa boba thinks that she can do better than a doctor just because his arms happen to be longer than his legs? Actually, I broke up with her.
[GASPS] Â¿CÃ³mo? Why? Because I realized you're the one I want to be with.
In whatever way it means to you.
Look, I don't know how much time I have left on this lonely, spinning space rock we call Earth but I know I don't want to spend it without you.
Ay, Leslie we're going to be friends again.
[LAUGHS] Come over tomorrow.
We will sit a respectable distance from each other and watch the Property Brothers.
[CHUCKLES] Now I'm blushing.
[LAUGHING] So, just to be clear just friends? Well, friends who occasionally hug.
Papito, what happened to your date? Did you find out she was an undercover cop here on assignment? [SIGHS] Turns out she was just using me to make stupid Travis Aarons jealous.
- [LAUGHING] - Oh, not with my son.
Whoa! Keep your earrings on.
Dude, you are not looking at this the right way.
A ninth-grade girl, who I swear was on The Bachelor last season just used you to make another guy jealous.
And it worked.
You gotta be pretty cool for that to happen.
- [CHUCKLES] You think? - Are you kidding? And now you got that whole sad-puppy-dog thing going for you.
Girls eat that stuff up.
Hey! That's true, though.
So, get back on the dance floor and show the ladies what you got.
[SCOFFS] Please.
They already know.
And just like that, he's back.
Can I have this dance? I am very impressed.
You were really great with Alex right now.
Oh.
Well, he's a great kid.
So is Elena.
Probably has something to do with their mom.
- Yeah.
They are pretty great, right? - Yeah.
I can't wait to have kids.
Hey, here's to you guys.
- Ooh.
Tomorrow, you will be American citizens.
This is my last night with a bunch of foreigners at my table.
- [LAUGHTER] - Yep, finally ready to renounce free health care, economic prosperity, and diplomatic respect for Oh, God, maybe I didn't think this through.
And tomorrow I will be as American as El Pollo Loco.
Salud.
[ALL] Salud.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You can't drink.
You have a test tomorrow.
Ay, please.
In Cuba, we had the four "R" s.
Reading, writing, 'rithmetic and rum.
Plus you only need to get 60% right to pass.
So basically, to become an American, you have to prove you're a D-minus student.
Yep, it's the same requirement as it is to become president.
Want me to help you clean up? Nah, you're gonna be an American.
Let the Latinos do it.
- [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] - [ELENA] That's weird.
[ALEX] What's wrong? Syd just sent me a text.
It's the dancing girl, salmon sushi and prayer hands.
Okay, don't panic.
Why would I panic? Now I'm panicking.
Relax.
When you get confusing emojis, you just need to send even more confusing emojis back until someone breaks.
You're in an intense game of emoji chicken.
- So should I send Syd a chicken? - Girl, are you cray? Okay, how about a ghost, a ski lift, and the Swedish flag? No, the Swiss flag.
But what does that mean? Exactly.
Aw.
Poor Elena.
So hard being a teenager in a relationship.
Yeah, kids.
Take 'em or leave 'em, right? Seems to me like you kinda love kids.
These two, they're always at each other's throats.
Alex, you are the best.
Thank you so much.
[EXCLAIMS] So passive-aggressive.
Is everything okay? Yes.
You know how you sometimes have a great, healthy meal, and two hours later, you're over the toilet with fire shooting out both ends? That's my life right now.
So, Penelope, I'm sensing some stress.
Uh, you think, Pam? Yeah, I'm freaking stressed.
[LAUGHS] Everything was going so great with Max.
I mean, you should see this guy.
Imagine if Bradley Cooper was stuck in a gym for almost a year with nothing to eat but hotness pills.
Okay, yes.
Maybe if Bradley Cooper was stuck in a gym with Charlize Theron and Bradley Cooper left.
[CHUCKLES] I don't want to have any kids.
It sounds like you need to tell Max that.
Yeah.
You hop up on a stool, you look him in the eye and you be tough.
Make him think you could burn down that garage, but you don't actually do it.
I wish somebody would've given me that advice.
If he breaks up with you because of that, that's on him.
He'll find someone else.
Does he like Korean barbecue? Sorry, super-duper Bradley Cooper, I'm only a human woman.
Well, of course, if we did have a baby, it would be like a tall me, so it'd be pretty hot.
I mean, that baby would have everything.
Wait, are you actually thinking about this? I'm just saying I'd have a hot baby.
- Pen - No.
I'm almost 40, okay? What am I going to do? Have one kid in college, one kid in high school, and one kid hanging off my boob? Honestly, these just started looking normal again.
There were a couple of years there where it was like [CLICKS TONGUE] And, you know, my mom's not getting any younger, and soon I'm gonna have to take care of her too.
No.
No.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Maybe you need to tell Max that you're making decisions that privilege self-care, even if that leads to a conscious uncoupling of your relationship.
What's that mean? You gotta throw truth at him, girl.
Even if he bails.
If you don't want a baby, don't be a baby.
Oh! You're right.
You're right.
I have to lay down the law.
Ugh.
- What am I thinking? A baby.
Smelly.
Loud.
- Mmm-mmm.
Drains all your life force away.
Oh, who needs that? Mmm-mmm.
So, Beth, what's been going on with you? Well [CHUCKLES] - I'm pregnant.
[CHUCKLES] - [ALL] Aw.
Congratulations.
[THEME SONG PLAYING] Abuelita, you're still studying? Don't you know everything by now? Of course.
I'm just trying to avoid getting propositioned by all these guys.
The process is a breeze.
There is nothing to be nervous about.
[SCHNEIDER SIGHS] They didn't call my name yet, did they? What the hell are you wearing? I'm trying to look more American.
Is it not working? [SCOFFS] I should have brought a gun.
- Are you okay? - No! [SCOFFS] Last night, I was testing the pH of the water in my seahorse ranch and, as I looked at those vomiting little guys, I realized I suck at tests.
All tests.
Drug, sobriety, vision, IQ, smog.
You name it, I fail it! Relax, pobrecito Schneider.
Look, look, look, you go in, they ask you a few questions, you come out.
Fricky-fracky.
American.
See? Oh, my God! They're gonna send me to Gitmo! Hi, folks.
I'm looking for Lydia Margarita Del Carmen Inclan Maribona Leytevidal de Riera.
Ooh, that's fun.
Hello.
He seems nice.
Listen up, people, because I'm only gonna say this once.
First name is a little, uh, smudged.
Uh, something Schneider? You'll do great.
Go get 'em.
[CHUCKLES] You like my outfit? [CHUCKLES] Oh, boy.
He's screwed.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss him.
Are you okay, Penelope? Yeah.
Sure, Doc.
Why? You put a blood sample label on my pudding cup and sent it to the lab.
Oh.
We cannot make mistakes like that.
Now I have no pudding.
[SIGHS] I'm sorry.
I guess I've just been a little distracted.
What's up? Believe it or not, I've been thinking about having a baby.
[CHUCKLES] It's crazy, right? What do you think? I think I've never been so flattered.
I'll do it.
Me? As the sperm donor? A short, Latino me with hair? Oh, man, that baby'd have everything.
Okay.
[LAUGHS] No, I am not talking about you, Doc.
I'm talking about Max.
Well, if that's the way you want to go.
But seriously, Doc, be honest.
Having a baby at my age, it's crazy, right? No, not at all.
I There is risk, but modern medicine has come a long way.
You're in great health.
With proper prenatal care, you could have babies for the next decade.
Don't tell me that, Doc! Tell me I'm old and dried up, and that my uterus is full of sand.
Something that's gonna make me feel better.
Look, you're gonna have to make up your mind, but if this is something you want to do with Max, you could.
Thanks a lot, Doc.
Now, when I come back after nine months with a healthy Latino Bradley Cooper baby, it'll be your fault.
All righty, your application looks complete.
Beautiful penmanship, by the way.
Thank you.
[CHUCKLES] When you are a dancer, even your fingers sashay.
I'm a dancer myself.
Mostly square.
Sometimes line.
I can tell by the fire in your eyes.
It's my allergies, but thank you.
Why don't we do-si-do into your civics test? Okay.
Name three of the original 13 states.
Oh, I can name them all.
But I will go for my favorite three.
Eh, South Carolina, Georgia and Rhode Island.
[CHUCKLES] Where is the Statue of Liberty? New York.
Wait.
New Jersey? She's straddling the border.
Uh, but I'm guessing her butt's facing New Jersey.
[LAUGHS] I'm from New Jersey.
Great town.
[IN NEW JERSEY ACCENT] Forget about it.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Beautiful cat.
That's my daughter.
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Would your daughter like to go out sometime? Or is she an inside daughter? Have you ever been convicted of a crime? My beloved Berto and I once made love in the park.
Well, uh, that's certainly naughty.
But you weren't arrested, so it doesn't count as a crime.
Oh, it was a crime.
A crime that no one saw us.
Have you ever been arrested? Does public nudity at a hockey game count? There is, uh, no mention of a public nudity charge in your file.
Oh, you just go to YouTube and type in "Zam-boner.
" Well, if it's not in here, we may need to re-run your background check.
Oh, no.
Are you in handcuffs? No, I passed! - Yay! - Congratulations! [SCHNEIDER LAUGHING] Please read the underlined words.
No problem.
[IN HEAVY ACCENT] "The fox is on the bitch.
" That is correct.
The fox is on the beach.
That's what I said.
Mm-hmm.
Well, you are a delightful candidate for citizenship.
- Ooh.
- And friendship.
[GASPS] - [CHUCKLES] - So, let's just Oh.
That's interesting.
Everything about me is interesting.
Which are you referring to? Please wait outside, Mrs.
Riera.
Oh.
Okay.
In the, uh, waiting room? [CHUCKLES] Ooh, here comes Abuelita.
- Felicidades.
Muy bien hecho.
- All right! Way to go.
What? What? Is something wrong? I don't know.
He said to wait here.
Maybe they make everyone wait while they figure out if you passed.
They didn't do that with me.
She told me I passed in the room and then I showed her my YouTube video.
Don't look for it.
I answered every question.
I aced the English test.
Did I do something wrong? [ELENA SIGHS] This is because you're Latinx.
The white guy goes in there and cruises to citizenship, despite having nothing to offer this country.
That's right.
Wait, are you talking about me? Could I lose my green card? - [GASPS] - [ALEX] No.
I'm sure everything's okay.
Maybe.
You would not be the first proud immigrant who got treated like a criminal.
I cannot believe this.
It is this government today.
This whole country has changed.
It has turned to caca.
This has been my home for more than 50 years, and they don't want me? Well, I don't want them.
Oh, Lydia, sorry, we just had a typo in your social.
You passed.
Welcome to America.
I love this country.
[LYDIA CHUCKLES] [KNOCK AT DOOR] - Hey, Schneider.
- [SCHNEIDER] Hey.
Hey! Mami told me you somehow passed.
Congratulations! Oh, thanks.
Yeah, they didn't specifically ask if I got drunk and tried to ride a moose, so after that I was golden.
Hey, can we talk? [SIGHS] I need a man's perspective.
How important is having kids to you? Never really thought about it.
Then why are you holding one? Oh, this thing? [CHUCKLES] This is Mikey McGurb, the McGurbs' grandson.
I'm just babysitting.
Okay, serious question, have you ever met a baby before? I'll have you know I babysat my babysitter's kids while she was babysitting my dad, so, yeah, I got a little experience under my belt.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Oh, it's my cousin Gordy.
He still thinks I'm full-on Canadian.
I gotta ease him into it.
Could you just - Oh, no.
Is he gonna be okay? - Oh, yeah.
You're all good.
- [BABY COOING] - [CHUCKLES] Gordo, ya hoser, how you doin', eh? [COOING] Babies are so stupid.
Why you so stupid, huh? - Hey.
- Hey.
[COOS] Hi.
Oh, yes.
Oh, my goodness.
You are pretty stinking cute.
All right, good news is Gordo bought it.
Bad news is I'm judging a poutine festival in Saskatoon next week.
[SIGHS] You okay? Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
It's just everything I've been going through with Max.
He wants to have a baby.
- Whoa.
- [SIGHS] When I hold this little nugget in my arms, I think it's not so bad.
- In fact, it's kind of amazing.
[CHUCKLES] - [COOING] Wow.
Well I don't know what you want but I do know that if you choose to have another kid, you'll be incredible.
You're the single greatest mother I know.
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from a guy with five moms.
And thank you, Mikey McGurb.
Thank you for reminding me that I do want to hold a baby again.
[SNIFFS] Someday, when I'm a grandmother.
[BABY COOING] [BOTH CHUCKLE] He likes you.
- Max, we need to talk.
- [SIGHS] I have been obsessing about something you said the other day.
Oh.
I just think Arby's is underrated.
Not the best, just solid.
No.
Not that.
Although you are dead wrong, it is a barf factory.
No, no.
I'm talking about when you said you wanted to have kids.
[CHUCKLES] I knew something was bothering you.
[SIGHS] I shouldn't have said anything.
We're so new and I didn't mean to freak you out.
I was just talking.
But you were serious? Well, yeah, I see myself becoming a dad someday, but it is way too early to have that conversation.
No, no.
See, that's the thing.
It's about ten years too late for this conversation.
I'm turning 40, Max and talking about this isn't going to get any easier, the longer we wait.
[SIGHS] I didn't know you were stressing about this.
I'm really sorry.
No.
I don't want you to be sorry.
Don't be sorry.
I get that you want kids.
It's a great thing, it's the best thing.
But I know that because I've already done it.
And I'm done with it.
Oh.
Uh, okay.
Yeah, no, I mean, no, I understand, you know.
Being a father was something I always wanted.
You know, babies and watch them grow up.
[GRUNTS SOFTLY] All those firsts.
But, hey, hey, hey, if it's a deal-breaker, I can let it go.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Really? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Yeah.
[SIGHS] Look, I just want to be with you.
I love your kids and I love you.
I love you too.
Ah! Good, you are here.
[SING-SONG] I want to show you something.
Oh, great.
I guess Schneider told you that I was thinking of having a baby.
- What? - You're having a baby? No! I'm not having a baby.
I told Schneider that Max wanted kids, and obviously, Schneider told Abuelita because he's a chismosa at heart.
No, Schneider did not say a thing.
This is what I want to show you.
[LAUGHING] I took the crib out of storage because Schneider wanted it for the gordito that he is babysitting.
But I'm saving it for you now, because this is much more exciting.
[EXCLAIMS] No, Mami, not happening.
Never say never, Lupe.
I said I would never be anything but Cuban, but here I am, Miss America.
[VOCALIZING "THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"] Okay.
Well, Mami, I am certain that I'm not having a baby with Max because we just broke up.
No.
[SIGHS] I knew he was too pretty to be straight.
Okay, we can salvage this.
I'll text him a slot machine, a bowl of ramen and a circus tent.
He'll come crawling back.
It's my decision.
I know you guys really liked him, but it is for the best.
He wants kids and I've already had my kids.
Even though he says he's okay with that, I know down the road, he is gonna regret missing his chance to be a dad.
And I love him, and I don't want to deprive him of the experience because I know how amazing it is.
I'm sorry, Mami.
It sounds like you did the right thing.
Plus, the last time you had a baby, you got it right.
Walk away from the table, Mami.
Know when to fold 'em.
[CHUCKLES] I love you dopes.
[CHUCKLES] We love you too.
- Homework.
- [BOTH GROAN] You are making a mistake.
Mami, don't.
A good man is hard to find and you have found a good man.
Lupita, I have spent so many years alone.
It's not something you want.
Really? 'Cause right now, I would love to be alone.
Yeah, but who's going to take care of you? I'm not going to be around forever.
I can take care of myself, okay? Yes, but you shouldn't have to.
I mean, mira, if down the road, Max wants a baby, pfft, y qué? A baby would be wonderful.
A gift from God.
I've got to do what's right for me.
If you love him, you can make it work.
How dare you say that? Come on.
This is the hardest decision I've made since I left Victor, and you're making it even harder.
Oh, you are just mad because you know I am right.
I made a painful decision, and the last thing I need is for you to tell me what an idiot I am for having made it.
Oye.
I am not just some pushy old lady.
- [SCOFFS] - And I know you.
I know you better than anyone on this Earth and I am telling you this is a mistake! Then it's my mistake to make! And it's not a mistake.
So you know what? If you've got any more advice, keep it to yourself, 'cause I don't want it.
Or anything else from you! Â¡Ya! Good night, Lupe.
Maybe you will have more sense in the morning.
[SPANISH SONG PLAYING] Mami, I got up early to get us pastelitos and coffee.
We gotta get going.
We gotta get downtown for the swearing-in ceremony.
Mami? Look, if you're mad about yesterday, I am sorry that things got so heated.
[SIGHS] Mami, whatever, we gotta get going, we have [GASPS] Mami! Mami!
[THEME SONG PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] - Hi.
Hey, Pen, I got Lydia's stuff you asked for.
Fuzzy Afghan she likes, picture of the Pope, picture of a different Pope, picture of your dad, picture of the family, picture of me with the family, picture of me by a waterfall.
I'm just gonna keep talking 'cause I'm not good in crisis situations.
This isn't a crisis.
Everybody, the surgery went well.
It prevented a stroke.
Now she's in a medically-induced coma.
Just have to wait for her to wake up.
She's gonna wake up, right? Yes, of course.
But you know this woman can't be rushed.
My wedding started half an hour late because she needed to adjust her tiara.
Yes, she wore a tiara to my wedding.
She wanted to match a little figure of herself on the cake.
No.
Up, up, up, up.
There will be no crying.
Your abuelita hates everything about crying.
Makes your eyes puffy, ruins your makeup, gives you mocos.
She did once tell me tears are the pee-pee of the face.
- Good vibes only.
Okay? - [SIGHS] - Good vibes.
- Good vibes.
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Hi, Mami.
Look who's here.
Alex, put this on her.
Elena, Papi on the nightstand, popes on the dresser, and Schneider by the waterfall in hazardous waste.
- What's up? - Oh, hi, Nurse Wally.
These your kids? Oh, no.
These are children I picked up outside, so I can show them what a coma looks like.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Funny.
Did you know that your mom is also a nurse? I do.
She's only told me, like, a hundred times.
- This is running low.
- That's literally why I'm here.
That's why you brought a refill, right? I'll be right back.
Why don't you two go get something to eat at the cafeteria? I swiped Nurse Wally's ID so you can get 10% off.
Mami, you go.
I'll hang out with Abuelita.
Okay.
Okay, Abuelita.
It's only you and me now.
Just the way you like it.
[SIGHS] I know you haven't had time, but your nails are a disaster.
Don't worry.
I got you covered.
So, you'll never believe what happened at church today.
That's right, we went.
Mami, me, even Elena.
And, no, she didn't burst into flames.
I thought you'd like that one.
Anyway, Padre Jose did the homily.
And I actually learned something.
"To whom much has been given, much will be required.
" That's from Luke.
But it's also from Spider-Man.
You know who Jesus said that to? Peter.
Parker? [MOUTHING] What? Anyway, a couple FYIs.
I made sure to record El Amor y la Sangre.
You will not believe what Rosalita did to Maria Luisa.
No spoilers, but Francisco estÃ¡ vivo.
[VOCALIZES] [SIGHS] Okay, that's all I'm gonna give you.
Okay, I think we're good.
Te quiero, Abuelita.
I know you'll wake up soon.
[DOOR OPENS] Hi, Alex.
How's our girl? Just waiting for her to wake up.
You know she doesn't like being rushed.
"Would you tell a rose to bloom faster?" [CHUCKLES] Oh, hi.
I'm a friend of the family.
Dr.
Leslie Berkowitz.
Oh, she has her own nurse, she has her own doctor.
Should I pull up a chair for her dentist? - Oh, hi, Doc.
- Hey.
I hope I'm not intruding.
No, no.
The more the merrier.
Yeah.
TÃ­o Felix is on his way with sangria and a karaoke machine.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, okay, so this is probably a good time to tell you that visiting hours are almost over.
[LAUGHS] Okay.
Uh, this is probably a good time to tell you we're Cuban.
Great.
I am from Pittsburgh, but visiting hours are still almost over.
You don't get it, Nurse Wally.
My mom will not be left alone for one second.
When my TÃ­a Mimi got sick, 13 of us spent the night praying at her bedside and she just had pink eye.
And then we all got pink eye.
So that's what's up.
You got it? You're little, but I'm afraid of you.
Good.
I gotta prep this bed.
I am definitely not hiding.
Alex, come with me.
Elena said the cafeteria food is a conspiracy to keep people sick, so it's all aboard the Panda Express.
Anything happens, you text me.
I'll be here in a second.
Oh.
Her nails are drying, so no hand-holding.
[SIGHS] I gotta say, Lydia, you even make a hospital gown seem glamorous.
But something is missing.
- Uh-huh.
- [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] There you go.
I'm so sorry this happened on your big day, Lydia.
Strange seeing you so still and quiet.
You are the most alive person I know.
Whenever I'm around you, I feel like I'm in an opera.
Everything is dramatic and exciting, and in a language I don't understand.
And I never want the show to end.
You are my favorite diva.
You make me feel like a young man of 45.
And I haven't felt 45 since I was 22.
So I don't care what we call our relationship or friendship or whatever.
My time with you is the only thing that makes me happy.
And I know that Berto is the love of your life.
[CHUCKLES] I get that.
But I think you might be the love of mine.
I hope that's okay with you.
Oh, drat.
I've Yeah, yeah.
Messed up a nail.
Uh [EXHALES] Alex is gonna kill me.
We'll just hide this.
- [SIGHS] - [DOOR OPENS] I made it halfway to the restaurant.
I forgot my purse.
[GASPS] What? Her vitals are fine.
- She's not wearing earrings! - [GASPS] Out of the way.
Stat! [SIGHS] Thank God she didn't wake up.
Isn't that what we want? [INHALES] She must never know.
I was talking to the head nurse.
She gave me all these treats after I gave her this treat.
Two could play at that game.
I'll just give her money.
[SIGHS] Elena, want some Jell-O? Jell-O is made from boiled down cow carcass.
Ooh.
More for me.
Let's go eat this in the hallway.
[SIGHS] I'm no expert, uh, but I think we have another beauty emergency.
[SIGHS] Abuelita, I'm putting lipstick on you, so you might wanna wake up and see this.
Mejor.
[SIGHS] Did I ever tell you why I stopped speaking Spanish? One day, uh, you sent me to school in a puffy yellow dress with a big red bow in my hair.
I looked like Ms.
Pac-Man.
And so, at lunch, uh, I "accidentally" flushed that bow down the toilet.
Took two flushes to get it down.
When I got home, you were so mad.
And you started going off on me in Spanish, and I I just didn't hear you.
[SIGHS] I mean, I heard you, I just didn't want to hear you.
[SIGHS] So, instead of answering back in Spanish, I just looked at you like And you started yelling at Mom.
[IMITATES LYDIA] "Your daughter cannot speak Spanish anymore.
She has lost her Cubanidad.
" [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So I had an out.
I pretend I can't speak Spanish, you ain't great at English.
It was perfect.
Except I screwed myself because I lost my Spanish.
[SNIFFLES] I lost my connection to you.
[SIGHS] And then last year came and I was so worried to come out to you.
[SNIFFLES] And you surprised me with your acceptance and your love and your support.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You even helped me get a girlfriend.
I know men love you, but you could crush it as a lesbian.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So now I feel stupid because all I wanna do is talk to you.
You're exactly who you are and you don't care if anyone gets it or not.
And you're loud and opinionated.
You always think you're right.
You are so stubborn.
Oh, my God.
Am I you? [GASPS] I should be so lucky.
[SNIFFLES] Because you're my hero.
Y te quiero.
[WALLY CRYING] I'm sorry.
[SNIFFLING] I kept trying to leave and then something emotional would happen.
And then something even more emotional would happen.
You guys are very emotional people.
In Pittsburgh, it's, "Steel Town, Steel Hearts.
" [CRYING] Oh, God.
What the hell is going on in here? - Wally's got a lot of stuff.
- [EXHALES] That felt good.
I haven't cried since I was six and my rabbit Tupac died.
For years, all those tabloid headlines saying Tupac was alive just toyed with my emotions.
I brought some stuff to make it homier for her.
I'm gonna need ten minutes.
Oh, yeah, I should probably go anyway.
The guy in 404 has been waiting, like, an hour for a sponge bath.
He must be freezing.
[CRYING] Wow.
You would hate this lighting.
[SIGHS] Sorry you missed the citizenship ceremony.
We'll go together when you're back on your feet.
It's so crazy how we're both immigrants.
I mean, I would never compare my story to yours, but the parallels are spooky.
You were 18, I was 18.
You left your family behind.
I left four step-families, a maid, a butler, a chauffeur, and a horse groomer who really got me.
[SIGHS] But Father was expanding his business to the US and so I had to go.
I remember, at the airport, I was crying.
But Father put his arm around me and he said, "Son, [CLEARS THROAT] only losers cry.
" So that was a long flight.
You don't know how dirty a dirty look can get until you're crying for a whole plane ride and you're not a baby.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I really didn't wanna be in America.
So I drank.
And I recreated the snowy plains of Canada with cocaine.
[SIGHS] I'm told I attended classes at Pepperdine University, but I will have to take that on faith.
So, I'm in a detox center in El Segundo.
This was my fourth rehab.
My re-re-re-rehab.
I thought I'd been doing a kickass job keeping my drug stuff a secret from all the tenants and then you showed up in my room at that clinic.
You brought me sopa de pollo and said it's Cuban penicillin.
[CHUCKLES] You told me, "You eat this, you get some sleep, and tomorrow, you try again.
" And then you tucked me in and kissed me good night on my forehead.
Forehead kisses are wildly underrated.
Just something really comforting about 'em.
Then again, it might just be you.
Dad never did that.
Or my horse groomer.
After I got out of rehab, I started hanging around your apartment a lot more, 'cause it helped.
Back then, it must have felt like you had this annoying, intrusive guy over.
Not like now.
'Cause now you're my family.
Don't worry.
I haven't legally changed my last name to Alvarez.
My lawyer said it was a whole thing, so Anyway, Pen said no crying, so I'm not gonna.
[SNIFFS] Actually, for once, I agree with Father.
Only losers cry.
And we're not losing anybody today.
Let's hit that oath ceremony soon, okay? Whoa.
- Too much? - Oh, definitely.
Pretty sure it's a fire hazard.
But it's beautiful.
[KNOCK AT DOOR] Hola.
Okay, I'm gonna stay cool, but there's definitely an exorcist guy in here.
Hi, Padre.
He's just here to do last rites.
Yeah, no.
I gotta go.
[SCHNEIDER SIGHS] Look, I'm just having you do this because God forbid something happens and she doesn't get into heaven on a technicality.
I understand.
If you'd like to join me, please.
Thank you.
Lydia, through this holy anointing, may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.
May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up.
Amen.
Wait.
There is one more thing.
Vicks VapoRub.
I blessed it.
Religion and science can live side by side.
Gracias, Padre.
Well, you must love this.
All these people coming in here, telling you how much they love you.
I mean, Schneider basically made you a stage.
You are the star of your coma, Mami.
But let me tell you something, viejita, I'm not part of this.
You're not getting a tearful bedside speech from me because I'm still mad about our fight last night.
I know you like to have the last word, but this is dramatic, even for you.
You can't have a stroke to win an argument, Mami.
It's not fair.
I mean, yeah, I said some unkind things.
[SIGHS] But you were being so you.
Then when you told me I was making a mistake breaking up with Max, I remembered another time you told me I was making a mistake.
It's when I enlisted in the army.
You remember that? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] We have had a lot of arguments, but that one is definitely in the top three.
Right after, "Don't get divorced," and, "Brown lipstick is for hoochies.
" Here is the most patriotic woman I know.
A woman who, every Fourth of July, makes us sing the national anthem while eating red, white, and blue flan.
Then, on my first day of basic training, Papi drove me to the airport alone, while you stayed home, pouting.
[VOICE BREAKING] You didn't even say goodbye to me.
I never brought it up because whatever, man, life goes on.
But I was leaving for boot camp, I was 18 and I was scared and you weren't there for me.
You know what pissed me off even more? Knowing your story about how, when you left Cuba, how your mami held your hand the whole car ride to the airport.
Kissed your forehead, and sang "Cielito Lindo" so you wouldn't feel afraid.
How you felt so loved.
Thank God that Papi was there for me, because you weren't.
I didn't know if what I was doing was right or not, joining the army, but guess what? It turned out to be very right.
Because I met Victor and I had those great kids.
And because I served, I get to go to school and live my dream.
So look at that.
Not a mistake after all.
Kind of the best decision I ever made in my freaking life.
And I did it without your blessing.
So I guess I didn't need your support then, and maybe I don't need it now.
[CRYING] Mami, please, wake up and argue with me.
Please, Mami.
I'm not ready.
Not yet.
[SIGHS] I'm not gonna say goodbye.
You hear me, Mami? Because I understand now why you didn't say goodbye to me when I went to the army.
Because you were scared I wasn't coming back.
And I forgive you because now I'm afraid.
And I'm not gonna say goodbye.
But instead, what I'm gonna say is this.
You did a really good job being my mami.
And because of that, we're gonna be okay.
I love you so much.
But if you need to go, it's okay.
It's okay.
[SIGHS] [IN SPANISH] That beauty mark that you have Pretty darling Next to your mouth Don't give it to anyone Pretty darling For it is mine Ah, ah, ah, ah Sing and don't cry Because by singing they get happy Pretty darling, the hearts Hola, mi vida.
I am here to pick you up.
[GASPS] Ay, Berto.
- You really kept me waiting, mujer.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You know I cannot be rushed.
- Would you tell a rose to bloom faster? - [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] If I didn't know any better, I'd say you did this to remain a Cuban citizen until the end.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Are you suggesting that I am being - dramatic? - [CHUCKLES] - SÃ­, that is what I'm saying.
- [CHUCKLING] Lucky for you, I like it.
And I am not the only one.
- Tell me about this Dr.
Berkowitz.
- [SCOFFS] Berto, he's just a friend.
But I like that you are jealous.
I am jealous, amor.
But I cannot blame this man for having excellent taste.
- [CHUCKLES] - Ay, mÃ­rala.
When she's sleeping, she still looks 12.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah, but I'm still mad at her.
Ay, mi vida, why? Because she had a good man and she let him go.
All about whether or not to have a baby.
The greatest gift.
And we make such good-looking ones.
[CHUCKLES] It's true.
Lupe said she was too old, but I would have had a baby with you at any age.
- Hmm.
- Fifty.
Sixty.
We could make a baby right now.
Don't tempt me.
Actually, if I remember correctly, I wanted to have many more babies, but you wanted to go back to dancing.
Oh, right.
Don't tell her.
[CHUCKLES] Ay, Dios mÃ­o.
You have lived one hell of a life.
That's true.
And I managed to be glamorous to the end.
I knew I could do it! [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Fue maravilloso.
- Mmm.
[SIGHS] And now, Elena's going to be graduating from high school, then college, then graduate school, then a doctorate.
I just wish I could be there to say, "You can't go to school forever.
Get a job.
" And then there is Papito.
Ay, Dios mÃ­o, ese niÃ±o.
[SIGHS] He just gets me.
You are my soul mate, but he is my other half.
I will miss him getting married.
I would have looked so good on top of that wedding cake.
[SMACKS LIPS] Pero Lupe What's the matter? Are you worried she won't be okay without you? No, no.
That's just it.
Obviously, she will be devastated and her bereavement will be written about in the history books.
She's gonna fine.
Our daughter is magnificent.
She is a spectacular mother and woman and nurse and fighter and healer.
Our daughter heals people, Berto.
And that is a tribute to your mothering, mi vida.
Yes.
My work here is done.
And let's be honest, God could use my help.
So, mi amor is it time? Not yet, mi vida.
Not yet.
Oh, thank God my nails are done.
- Mami! - [GROANING] Mami! Abuelita.
Hello.
[LAUGHING] "I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
" Mai Ling.
Lydia Margarita Del Carmen Inclan Maribona Leytevidal de Riera.
- Yeah! - [CHEERING] AsÃ­! [LAUGHING] Dale, Abuelita, dale! Dale, Abuelita, dale! [VOCALIZING] - Dale, Abuelita, dale! - Ay! There are more people.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
James Rose.
 [door opens] Who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who Bought one pizza and got two free?Â  That's meÂ  That's meÂ  [snaps] What? You hate pizza now? Or was it the song? Please say pizza 'cause I feel like that jam really worked.
It's your tia Ophelia.
She's dead.
Oh, my god, Mami.
That's terrible.
Who is she again? We can't remember either.
Okay, is she the tia that always wears yellow? That's tia Big Bird.
Is she the one that always finds new ways to insult you? Pfft! That's tia Bitchy.
So none of us can remember who she is? Oh, tia Ophelia.
What a tragedy.
We danced all night at Elena's quinces.
She had scarlet fever as a child and lost her right eye.
Ophelia was the tia with the eye patch.
tia Jack Sparrow! Aha! I called her tia Blackbeard, but then that got confusing because we have another tia with an actual black beard.
[laughter] [Elena] Sorry.
At least we'll get to see the family at the funeral.
Everybody will be there.
Mimi, Maruchi, Rosita, Tio Juanito, Baby Juanito, and now his baby Gordito Juanito.
Aah! It'll be good to see everybody.
Except, of course, La Diabla.
Ooh, there is a tia Diabla? [scoffs] Sounds hot.
She's Abuelita's little sister, Mirtha.
Who Mami has been mad at for 20 years because of a stupid mantilla.
Mami, Mirtha said she doesn't have it.
- That's because - She's a liar.
But didn't you Rightfully accuse her of having it all these years? Because she does.
- Go comb your hair.
- I don't have to.
[groans] So, what's a mantilla? Is that like a trans-tia? No.
But I like that I'm in your head.
A mantilla is a lace veil that's passed on from bride to brideÂ in our family, and you stitch the couple's name into it.
It's a Spanish tradition.
That is why we will never speak to Mirtha and her family ever again.
Right, Lupe? No.
This ends now.
As a matter of fact, I'm hosting the reception after the funeral here.
La Diabla at my house? She will never make it past that cross.
Mami, the only thing we're burying at this funeral is your feud and tia Amelia.
- [all] Ophelia.
- Aye! Whoever! [Lydia] How can you not take my side? Family is everything.
You have to hate my sister.
I am sick of this old-lady beef.
Come on.
This cost me my relationship with Estrellita.
[whispering] That's Mirtha's daughter, your mami's cousin.
She used to be my best friend.
She even taught me the entire choreography to Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation" video, which got me mad props in the Army.
I don't think those are Janet's moves.
Shut up.
We improvised.
You know what, Mami? If you don't settle this feud, I'll tell the whole family you had a stroke.
[gasps] Then they will think I'm old.
Well, then you agree.
You don't want your name changed to tia Any-Day-Now.
- [theme song plays] This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [sobbing] Penelope, linda.
Hi, tia.
I see you're still enjoying your mother's tostones.
[chuckles] Hi, tia.
Hello, Elena.
Still just the one eyebrow? I guess that was tia Bitchy.
Yeah.
I need to hide.
This funeral is like The Walking Dead of tias.
I mean Oh, oh, oh.
There's tia Pilar.
I've always wondered if she's gay.
Elena, you think everyone is gay.
Pilar is just eccentric.
She rides a motorcycle.
She owns seven cats.
She shares a one-bedroom apartment with her long-time roommate, Susan.
How is that gay? Okay.
Mami, what's that? All right.
Pilar is definitely gay, but nobody talks about it.
Everybody's like, "Well, you know Pilar.
She's just" - That is so offensive.
- It is? It is.
I'm woke.
This is ridiculous.
I'm just gonna ask Pilar if she's gay.
Someone in this family needs to accept her.
And I can shepherd her out of the closet and into the light.
Like a lesbian Jesus? I love that.
Because I have long hair, and I'm a really good carpenter, and I look really good in Birkenstocks.
Hey, baby, nobody looks good in Birkenstocks.
Besides, it's none of our business, and it would be rude to ask, so don't.
- Okay? - Okay.
Looks like you need a man on the inside to get you intel on Pilar.
A double-o seis.
Double-o six? [counts in Spanish] Whatever! The point is, I know Spanish, but nobody expects it from Tio Handsome Gringo.
[sighs deeply] So I'll get you the goss.
Or chisme as we fluents call it.
You are not fluent, Schneider.
Neither are you.
[gasps] [Lydia] There is my sister.
La Diabla herself.
With her lizard eyes, and her vulture claws, and her gray roots.
I am here.
Ophelia, you can now finally rest in peace.
I could take her.
Mami, you said you were going to apologize.
Okay.
[inhales deeply] I'm going in.
- Mirtha.
- Lydia.
- Estrellita.
- Hi.
[gasps] Oh, God! There's so much to catch up on.
I got divorced.
Stronger now.
I tried the Brazilian Blowout in '07.
Did not like the upkeep.
What are you doing? Just rocking my natural curls.
You don't like it? No.
I mean talking to me.
We're not allowed.
- It's not safe.
- Okay.
It's okay.
I talked to Mami.
She's fixing everything right now, and we're going to be able to hang out just like old times.
[sighs deeply] If she gets close to the coffin again, I'll push her in! - Really? - No.
I don't know what just happened.
But, uh, this ends today.
We will be together again.
Don't make promises you can't keep.
And I love your curls.
Always have, always will.
[both sigh] [Penelope inhales sharply] Mami, I thought you said you were going to apologize to tia Mirtha.
Paciencia.
This will all be over soon.
Yeah, I don't like that.
Hi, Pilar.
Elena.
How are you, honey? I'm gay.
I came out at my quinces.
Yeah, I know.
I was there.
I jump started your mom's car off my truck.
So, how's school? Well, as a gay student, it's going great.
I started a GSA, a gay-straight alliance, because no one should ever feel ashamed of who they are which is gay.
That's great,Â mija.
So, how are you? Well, my aunt just died, so Right.
Right.
Right.
Oh, look, anyone else.
Poor Ophelia.
[mimics sobbing] I know, I know.
Oh, sequin eye patch.
Nice touch.
[knocks coffin] Papito.
There's too many people around.
It's time to do what we talked about.
No! Please, there must be another way.
There is no other way.
Does anybody want to see pictures of me at Homecoming? Me and the Cuban girl who I will probably marry.
Don't touch the hair! She looks Puerto Rican.
[whispers] Mami.
You had the mantilla this whole time? No, she had it! Ay, Ophelia.
You were the only one who could ever truly see me.
[gasps] Thief.
[gasps] Ophelia had the mantilla all this time? Ha! It makes sense.
Do you know[clears throat] she had her eyes on it for a long time until 1952, then she had her eye on it.
Ay, Lydia, all these years I blamed you.
Oh, and I blamed you for blaming me, but can you blame me? I would say I'm sorry, but I cannot without hearing our mami calling me weak from her grave.
Te quiero, Mami.
And I am sorry too, and I also will never say it out loud.
All is forgiven.
Hug it out, viejitas! [laughs] We're back! [cheering, laughing] Oh, my God! There's so much to talk about! Cage started a new school, magnet.
Dead tooth, fixed.
In '07, I also got a Brazilian down there.
Never again.
So, now I'm rocking my natural curly too.
Oh, God! - I missed this so much.
- Me too.
What are you doing? Obviously, we don't want the mantilla to go down in the dirt with Ophelia.
- You're right.
- Yeah.
Our great-grandmother got married and executed in it.
That was quite a quinces.
Oh, yeah.
Did you get any chismes? No.
Everyone speaks Spanish so much faster than on my tapes.
[Elena sighs] I did hear something about Pilar moving to Tampa though.
What? No! She's probably moving because the family doesn't accept her.
I have to do something about it.
She's the only other gay in the family.
Elena, can I borrow your ChapStick? Pero if it's not Fenty by Rihanna, then I don't even want to look at it.
Not now, Flavio.
[huffs] We might be Cuban, but we're still citizens of the Rhythm Nation.
Is it weird we are dancing at a funeral? It's a Latino funeral.
It'd be weird if we weren't dancing.
We didn't always nail it, but we could sell it with confident face.
Also the face we used to sneak into R-rated movies.
- Do you remember what happens after this? - We steal wine coolers from our parents and kiss magazine pictures of Leonardo DiCaprio.
- Yeah! - [laughs] I forgot how much fun we had together.
Best years of my life.
You know, I still have all the letters your wrote me while I was in the Army.
- You do? - Yeah.
'Cause they mean a lot.
I had some really rough nights when I'd be under the covers, crying, and I would just take out one of your letters, start reading it, and it would feel like you were right there next to me, making me laugh and telling me that everything was gonna be okay.
Wow.
I can't believe I have my best friend back.
Me too.
I was in the hospital for a week.
Ay, Mami, I can't tell you how happy I am that our family is back together again.
I want to kill Mirtha.
She's bragging about her little cancer scare.
Cancer is scary, Mami.
Oh, it was nothing.
Mimi told me that she had a mole removed that looked like a Tic-Tac.
Now look at her go.
And then I told God, "I would rather die than lose my beautiful locks," and God said, "Nobody knows this, Mirtha, but on the seventh day, I wasn't resting, I was creating your hair.
" And the next day, the cancer was gone.
[all gasp] The nerve of her making a big deal of her cancer.
I had a stroke! Well, Mami, you could tell people if you wanted.
Never.
I would not be caught dead having a stroke.
Pero Mirtha Oh, Mirtha needs all this attention.
I'm surprised she's not singing.
And now I would like to honor Ophelia with a song.
Ave MariaÂ  Dumb payasa.
She sings like a donkey.
Un cocotazo.
Mami, no! Mami, no! Lydia, won't you join me in this song? Well, I don't know if I can sing as beautifully as you do.
Ave MariaÂ  Gratia plenaÂ  Hi! [tongue clicks] Really don't pick up on social cues, do you? So, I wanted to apologize for earlier because I was going on and on about myself, when really I'd like to know more about you.
You and Susan.
You have been friends for a long time.
Are you thinking you might do, like, a friendship ceremony sometime soon? Maybe you can have something old, something new, something borrowed, and something flannel? What are you getting at, Elena? Okay, so I just feel like maybe you can't live your life as who you really are because you're afraid of what the family might think.
Am I right? Okay, I have been hiding something.
Come on out, sister.
I'm Jewish.
What? How are you Jewish? I converted for my wife, Susan.
Oh! I see what you did there! You got lesbian jokes! No, but really.
I'm so excited that we can talk about this.
And I'm so sorry that you've had to keep being gay a secret for so long.
Oh, it's not a secret.
I'm out to the family.
It just does not stick.
[sighs] My mom keeps telling them I'm afraid of men because I was attacked by a man in college.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
It was not a man.
It was a squirrel, and it was female.
Okay.
So your mom needs to stop making up these stories.
You should go out there right now and come out to the entire family.
Make them accept it.
Elena.
[chuckles] Mira, these viejitas, they're not gonna change.
And, honestly, I don't care.
I know that they love me.
Look, I know how being gay goes, right? When you first start to figure it out, it's like, "Oh, no, I might be gay.
" And then it's like, "Oh, I'm gay.
" And then it's like, gay, gay, gay! Rainbow underwear! But eventually, you realize you're just a person, and it's really empowering not to have to be defined by who you want to make out with.
Oh, wow.
I might be the lesbian Jesus but you're a lesbian God.
[sighs] Yes, I have been called that before.
[both laugh] Well, I don't want to lose touch with you when you move to Tampa.
I'm not moving to Tampa.
Susan and I are just going on vacation to Busch Gardens.
Yeah, you are.
Ave MariaÂ  [all cheering, clapping] Oh! I am so happy that stupid mantilla crap is behind us.
- Right? - Yes.
Where is it anyway? It's in Mami's bag.
Don't worry, we'll keep it safe.
Oh, you know what? We can just take it.
I didn't have it at my wedding and I'd love to get mine and Juan's name stitched in it.
Oh, okay.
And then you'll just give it back after? Oh, are you getting remarried? I mean I could [chuckles] but my kids are the oldest and the next in line to get married, so it just kind of makes sense.
Does it? What does that mean? Well, Elena is, you know Excuse me? Because your son Flavio is Seriously, this whole apartment is yellow? Somebody give tia Divorce a color wheel.
Hand over the mantilla, Penelope.
Make me, tia Gray Tooth.
- [gasps] I got it fixed! - It doesn't match.
- I got it.
- You better give that back! No, never! I am getting mine and Juan's names on here, and taking yours and Victor's off! - What? - She couldn't keep him tied down.
Why should the mantilla? Oh! Oh, that was nasty! Te la juro! You know what? Monica is no longer tia Bitchy.
You are.
Ha! Who calls me tia Bitchy? Tell her to let go.
That mantilla belongs to us.
- I had a stroke! - What? I got it! AsÃ­! Oh, oh, oh.
I am sorry.
I meant I had a stroke of genius.
Mami, there are no names stitched on here.
No.
[gasps] This is not a mantilla.
She's right! This is just some random piece of lace.
So, you stuffed some worthless piece of caca into the casket with Ophelia? You knew? Of course, I knew.
No one gets buried with a mantilla.
We're Cubans, not ancient Egyptians.
So who has the real mantilla? Well, La Diabla obviously.
Mentirosa! You have it.
How dare you call me mentirosa when you walk around acting like that is your hair color? [gasps] Oh! Well, at least I can still salsa without breaking a hip.
Well, I'll admit that you are light on your hooves.
But I would like to show you what that step looks like when you don't have feet like a chupacabra.
[vocalizes merengue music] Eso! Just admit you have the mantilla.
Wait.
The mantilla is what you all have been fighting about? Yes! I have it.
Susan and I used it at our wedding.
You were all there.
That was a wedding? [mumbles] I just thought it was a very affectionate barbecue.
Oh, my God! So, we've been fighting for over 20 years about nothing.
We should all be ashamed of ourselves.
Look at what this has done to us.
Mami, you lost your sister.
I lost my best friend.
Yeah, Lupe is right.
I have missed you, Mirtha.
I've missed you too, mi hermana.
I was in a coma because I had a stroke.
- [gasps] - I know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Ay, pucha! I'm so glad you're okay.
Let's put this all behind us.
Who knows how much time we have left? After all, I had cancer.
You are right.
Even though a coma beats cancer.
[Lydia sniffs] If there's one thing we can take from Ophelia's death is that life is too short.
We shouldn't spend it fighting.
Yeah, we're gonna have differences, but what does that matter? We're family.
Okay? - Familia para siempre.
- [all] SÃ­.
[indistinct chattering] I am so glad we're good again.
Promise me that we'll keep in touch.
Of course, because we love each other too much to let anything get in between us again.
I wanna make a toast.
[Penelope chuckles] To Ophelia.
At least she got to see our President make America great again.
I'm sorry.
What? [theme music playing]
[fighting video game sounds on TV] Wow.
Another Saturday on the couch.
Why don't we make it a goal to see the sun today? Go down to the lake, get in a leaky paddle boat, make out with your girlfriend.
Whoa, what'd I say? Is paddle boat insensitive to motor boats or something? I can't keep up.
No, it's just, we're not calling Syd my girlfriend anymore.
To be clear, Elena's okay with me calling her my girlfriend.
- I like hearing it.
- I like saying it.
Focus.
Since Syd identifies as non-binary I want to call them by a term that's more acceptable and inclusive.
I'm partial to - my everything.
- I like it.
Nope, you gotta reel that in.
Oh, you know what I always thought was so cute? "Better half.
" I don't wanna call Syd half a person.
[gasps] What if I tell people you're my better whole? You're not saying that.
Don't you have anything better to do than sit around and think of names to call each other? Alright, I've been brainstorming names all night.
"Main Squeeze," "Person Friend," "Your Gay of Sunshine.
" Schneider, we didn't ask for your help.
In fact, we specifically said, "Do not help us.
" But it's my duty as an ally.
You can't call yourself an ally.
It's like when people call themselves woke.
But I am woke.
I'm wide awoke.
Let me just bounce some ideas off ya.
- "Partners"? - We're not lawyers.
- "Lovers"? - We're not gross.
"Longtime Companion"? We're not two 70-year-old men suing each other over the custody of a bulldog.
Can't you do this somewhere else? Alex took his girlfriend to the museum.
And "girlfriend" is Chloe's preferred term, so don't even.
Wha-wha-what? Chloe? Do tell! I haven't seen anything about a girlfriend on his Instagram.
Oh, It's probably on his Finsta.
Your favorite book is Chamber of Secrets.
Why can't you keep them? - What's Finsta? - I don't know.
- Yes, you do.
- Okay.
So everyone has a public Instagram where they post pictures with their mom and sunsets and other pretend nice crap.
And then they have a secret Instagram for their friends, a Finsta, where they live their real lives.
How did I not know about this? I have a F-Linked-In, a F-witter and a F-Facebook.
- Well, do you have a Finsta? - Of course.
But it's just me cosplaying Wynonna Earp.
You said a lot of words that sound fake.
But okay.
It's not fake, and it is way hot.
[chuckles] My Finsta is exclusively my chinchilla in drag.
I am requesting to follow.
- Well, what's Alex's? - I don't know.
It's a private account.
Private? Pfft! There's no privacy here.
This house is a dictatorship.
I need to know where you are, who you're with, and what you thinking.
Fine, I will show you my Finsta.
Girl, I don't care about your nerdy crap.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [Dr.
Berkowitz] Hey.
I get why you're wound up.
But kids, they keep secrets from their parents.
That's how it is.
My daughter got married.
I didn't even find out till I got the bill.
Big wedding.
Well, my kids don't keep secrets from me.
Supposedly, Alex is at the museum with Chloe to see the Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit, - but who knows? - Yeah, he's there.
It's all over his Finsta.
He lets you follow him? Yeah, we're co-workers, and bros.
Bro-workers.
Show me.
- Sorry, bro-workers before - Give me that! Oh, okay.
It's mostly pictures of sneakers he can't afford.
- [phone dings] - New post.
Him and Chloe at the museum, perfectly fine.
Nice pull, Alex.
Really? You're saying that about a 15-year-old girl? [sighs] I guess not.
And I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable in a work setting.
What's with him? We took that sexual harassment seminar.
And I'm putting all I learned into action.
You probably noticed how I've tamped down my toxic masculinity.
It's been refreshing.
Yep, me and Doc both learned that we can never say anything nice about any woman's body ever again.
Your loss.
I'll try to survive without you telling me my "melons" are in season.
Ah, yeah.
That was a good one.
[laughs] Comments like that are definitely inappropriate, and it goes both ways, which is why I started wearing an undershirt.
Which is ridiculous, Doc, because you have a rockin' bod.
Thank you.
Wait.
No, thank you.
What kind of janky-ass seminar was this? All I know is I feel for Alex.
I would hate to be a teenage boy in today's dating world.
"Hi, would you like to go to the prom? I'm suing you! Hashtag MeToo.
" [phone dings] AhOh.
Another pic of Alex and Chloe.
"I got hoes in different area codes.
" Well, that's not good.
Yeah, your long distance bill is going to be nuts.
Well, I don't love his language, but Whatever.
He's trying to be cool for his friends.
It must be so hard to be a mom of a teenage boy right now.
It's so confusing out there.
Is it? I mean what do I say? Don't be creepy, don't be douchey, don't be Scott.
It's not hard.
That's what she said.
No, the woman at the seminar.
Come on! Well, I just wish I had some parental guidance about how to talk to women.
I learned everything on the streets.
I remember once a bunch of us went out and the guys were chatting up the gals and they were so confident.
And I didn't know how to be that way.
And finally, I just said, "Leslie, let's do this.
" But when the next woman walked by, what came out was, "Yum yum, give me some.
" You were just an awkward teenager.
You grew out of that nonsense.
This was last month.
The bar scene can be tough.
I was at synagogue.
[phone dings] Okay.
Alex posing with a statue, and honking its boob.
Oh, man, that's not cool.
That statue doesn't even have arms to push him away.
[phone dings] Now he's posing with Chloe and honking her boob.
Ha! Like it's a horn.
[laughs] Like.
Syd's your "Queer Dear.
" [both] No.
Your "Non Bino-saur.
" [both] No! Your "Mighty Morphin Power Ganger.
" Ugh, it's too '90s.
That's your problem with it? Hi, Mami.
How was your day? Great.
At lunch time I was bummed 'cause I wasn't super excited about my turkey sandwich.
But then I had one of those mini Snickers? Surprisingly satisfying.
Oh, and Alex is a perv.
Que? What are you talking about? Check out his Finsta.
How did you get into it? I took Scott's phone, I think it gave me HPV.
Look at Alex's post.
[all gasp] Alex! He's pretending his water bottle is his dingle.
[chuckles] That kid isa filthy monster.
I can't believe my own brother has such disrespect for women.
And the planet! I mean, a plastic water bottle? He should be using a reusable dingle.
This right here, this is that straight-up teenage boy garbage, where they think everything stupid and gross is hilarious.
It's not hilarious, it's sleazy, and I refuse to be the mother of a sleaze.
Well, I had a wonderful time at the museum exposing myself to art.
I saw your Finsta.
What? But Scott told me bro-workers before Nope! Look, it's not a big deal.
Everybody has one of those.
Does everyone post pictures of themselves running around like a goose honking everything in sight? What? Honking boobs! Alex, Alex, Alex.
I mean Tweaking tatas.
Fondling fun bags.
Grabbing gazungas.
What? Yeah, uh, sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Look, it's just dumb stuff that makes my friends laugh, and gets me 320 likes.
Well, it's not cute, Alex.
Especially how you were treating Chloe.
She is right, Papito.
I have taught you better manners than that.
Actually, I taught you better manners than that.
Because I taught you better manners than that.
Pero in this case, I feel responsible.
Because I am the reason that he got the date with Chloe in the first place.
Do I wanna hear the rest of the story? Pobrecito Papito.
He was so sad because he asked Chloe out and she said no.
But What did I tell you? I said, "You keep trying.
Wear her down.
Don't take no for an answer.
" And ticky-tocky, now he has a girlfriend.
Mami, you literally told Alex no means yes? Oh, no, no.
What I said was, "Every no is a yes in disguise.
" Oh, my god.
Abuelita, you are an enabler of toxic masculinity.
Oh, please, I do not enable toxic men.
I clean Papito's room twice a day.
No, it's how society has encouraged men to define their maleness as being aggressive, unemotional, sex-obsessed.
You're just describing a man.
Mami, maybe in your day, but times change.
Men need to be careful about how they talk to women, or else they'll get in trouble.
Oh, poor men! "Now I can't yell from a passing car that I think a woman has sweet tatas.
" I know, it's a shame.
In my day, when I walked down the street, I would hear a symphony of compliments.
You were being harassed.
Oh, yes.
Much more than all the other women.
Mami, maybe you're comfortable with that type of attention but not everyone is.
You know what, then they are crazy.
Women want to be wooed.
Like you TÃ­a Mimi.
Well, when she met your TÃ­o Rico, she did not like him because he was feÃ­to.
But Rico was not stopped by his unfortunate face.
You see, he had a beautiful farm.
And one night, he broke into Mimi's room, and blindfolded her and they went for a "drive.
" Do I wanna hear the rest of this story? And the next thing Mimi knew, she was afraid and barefoot, standing in the middle of a sugarcane field.
Oh, my god! I know, bare feet.
Pfft! Anton says Rico took off her blindfold, and she swooned.
Because it was dark and it was working for him.
And then Rico says, "This can all be yours.
Mimi.
Will you be mine?" And ticky-tocky, they've been married ever since.
That is romance.
That is the plot of Taken 2.
And "ticky-tocky" seems to smooth over some really horrifying things.
Okay.
Alex, here's the thing about women.
Oh, boy.
Women are beautiful.
The curve of their neck, the way that they move, everything.
Preach! That's why I'm an ally.
No means no.
Yes means yes.
But it's more complicated than that, Schneider.
It can't just be a yes.
It has to be an enthusiastic yes.
A "hell yes!" Oh, I've never gotten one of those.
We will show you.
- Mom, can I please go to my room now? - No, honey.
I think it's important that you watch this.
Really? Syd, may I place my hand on your shoulder? Yes.
May I place my hand on your waist? Yes! Oh, boy, I can feel the heats.
May I lovingly caress the slope of your cheek because it feels like home? Come on.
Is this really what the kids do? - Yes! - No one's ever done that.
Be real, this is how your first kiss went? Oh, no, not at all, this one just went for it.
So you didn't know if you had their consent.
We were just demonstrating the ideal.
I remember she pulled that Doctor Who scarf around my neck.
- Okay, Syd.
- Kinda chocked me actually.
- Okay.
- The cops had to break us up.
Okay! I gotta admit, I'm getting kind of confused.
Oh, my god, me too.
What if someone says, "I am not sleeping with you tonight?" And then an hour later, they're like, "Eh, fine.
" What's that? Unsurprising.
How many women have said, "Eh, fine"? Yeah, I got to make some calls.
- Now I'm really confused.
- I know.
It's confusing.
I hate to admit it, but I feel sorry for men.
This consent thing is tricky.
No.
Women always blame themselves, and then the man never has to take responsibility.
During rape prevention week at school, all the signs are aimed at women.
"Girls, don't dress provocatively.
Girls, don't walk alone.
" How about, "Hey, guys, don't rape.
" Oh, my god, why are we talking about that? I took a couple pictures as a joke and Chloe thought it was funny.
Did she? Or did she feel like she had to laugh, 'cause she don't know what else to do with your hand on her boob? - Okay, Elena, take it easy.
- No.
He thinks what he did is cute.
You are basically a predator.
You're basically a psycho.
Wow, you too.
Good, call me crazy for defending a woman's right not to be groped! You're mad 'cause the internet told you to be.
You don't know my life, or even leave this apartment! Because of guys like you! What are you talking about? [scoffs] You want to know? Okay.
A couple of weeks ago, Syd and I were coming home from the movies on the bus, and we were holding hands.
And we noticed these guys staring at us, and then we got off the bus and they followed us.
What? Yes.
And they were going, "Come on, you guys, kiss.
We really wanna see it.
Just kiss.
" They thought that was really funny, too.
It was actually really scary.
It was terrifying.
And then we finally lost them in a crowd and ran home.
Since then we've just stayed here.
Which is such a bummer.
Because it felt so good to be out as a couple and we had such a good day.
Elena, I'm sorry.
That sucks.
- I freaking want to kill those guys.
- No.
I don't want you to bloody your beautiful hands.
I will do it! Both of you, please cool it with the toxic masculinity.
The worst part is, I didn't stand up to those guys.
I didn't say anything.
Baby, you did the right thing.
In situations like that, you just have to keep yourself safe.
I know, but still.
I mean, you would never put up with that, Mom.
Well When I was in the Army I had a mentor and he was my first sergeant.
He thought I was a great medic and he took me under his wing.
He assigned me to a trauma room in a tactical field hospital and that was a big step for me, and I really wanted to make him proud.
Then one night, I was finishing up paperwork when he walks in with a bottle of whiskey.
And right away, in my gut, I knew that something was wrong.
He said "We should have a drink.
We've been working so hard.
" And he said how it felt right the two of us together.
And inside, I was like, "What?" I mean, this guy was like my work dad and I didn't know what to do.
Then he got close to me.
He grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch.
Oh, my god, Mom.
Well, you know me.
I'm reactive.
So I screamed and I kicked him in the balls.
Dang, Mami don't play.
AssÃ­, right in the aguacates.
Mami, please tell me that guy got kicked out of the Army.
I wish.
My platoon sergeant offered to file a complaint, but he was honest.
It would take forever.
Plus, honestly, I didn't want people to know.
Because then that's all they know and that defines you.
He also said that I might be transferred and I didn't want to get transferred.
I freaking loved that job and I was good at it.
But I was scared.
So I said nothing.
Lupita, honey, don't feel bad.
You got through it because you are strong.
Yeah, but I still feel guilty about it.
See, this is the problem.
If you don't say something, you carry it around inside.
If you do say something, you carry it around outside.
Well, it's all super depressing, Mom.
But the good news is is that the future is bright because of strong, amazing, young people like you, who aren't taking any crap.
And maybe you want to put all that righteous anger into becoming a lawyer.
That's all I'm saying.
You would rock a pantsuit in a courtroom, is all I'm saying.
Part of me doing better is making sure you have it better.
Making sure you do better.
And you a little less ticky-tocky.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I don't want to make anybody feel the way those dumbasses made you feel.
Sorry for saying dumbass.
I would have said worse.
It's okay, Alex.
I know you're a good guy.
Yes, you are.
Just remember there's a heart behind that boob.
Got it.
Who wants chicken boobs for dinner? Sorry, wrong crowd.
Well, I just got done calling all my exes.
I can report that all of my romantic moves have been 100 percent consensual.
And 1,000 percent disappointing.
I just spent 12 hours listening to women tell me all my flaws.
Oh, Schneider, you didn't have to call anyone for that, we're right downstairs.
Would it cheer you up to know that we found the perfect relationship name? "Nerds"? It's flattering, it's non-gendered, and it's fun to say.
Syd is my SO.
"Significant Other.
" Or are they your "Syd-nificant Other"? Oh, my god! That's genius! Hey, girlfriend, wanna go out somewhere? Hell, yeah, Syd-nificant Other.
Yay, they're going outside! Hey, wait, is there something you guys wanna call me? Starts with an A.
Don't say the first thing you thought of.
[mambo music plays] Abuelita! No dancing! You heard what the doctor said.
Who could understand her? I am fluent in mambo, not mumbo jumbo.
Well, as a future nurse practitioner, let me explain her diagnosis.
Sit your crazy fondo down or you're gonna die.
I don't trust that doctor.
The first thing she did was weigh me, and after that everything she said was clouded by jealousy.
Abuelita, you are on blood thinners and you need to start using your cane to walk.
Why should I have to use a cane when I am so able? [chuckles] Read the Bible.
I'm serious.
I want to see you using that cane.
Okay.
That I can do.
Papito, hit it.
Ame.
[mambo music plays] Don't enable this! You're lucky I talked her out of the fishnets.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Auction item number 32.
Spa in a box.
Hmm.
Two soaps and a bottle ofÂ rosÃ©.
Somebody's gonna be a real clean drunk.
Maybe me.
Ooh A gift certificate for vaginal rejuvenation? Where do we put this? Front and center so we can see who bids on it.
Hey, I just realized it's our anniversary.
It's the third year in a row of us doing all the work setting up this fundraiser.
Oh.
What's the traditional gift for that? Do not sayÂ vaginal rejuvenation.
[women laughing] You know, this would go a lot faster if we were getting any help from the Sisterhood of the TravelingÂ Implants.
I'm just gonna say it.
I miss Matt Lauer.
Hey.
What's up, ladies? We are so close to finishing up.
[both] Woo-woo! Okay, I'm just gonna keep on going.
So I was thinking that if everyone grabbed a couple baskets, we could be done in like ten minutes.
And if you could grab ten baskets, we could be done in like one minute.
[clears throat] See, I can do math too.
Nikki, are you eating an auction item? Relax, Penelope, they're gluten-free.
Anyway, I wish we could help, but we're on our way to the gym.
Hmm.
This is a gym.
Yeah, and lifting baskets can be your workout.
[laughs] No, it's not an arms day.
No.
[in Spanish] It's a miracle she didn't send a maid.
[in Spanish]Â The maid is at the house with a body.
The woman is crazy.
[chuckles] You two are so cute, with your secret language.
You sign her up for the pervy dog, I'll put her down for the vag tune-up.
Abuelita, if you are gonna do laundry, you need to use your cane.
You are right.
Can you hold it a little higher? Abuelita, you can fight this all you want, but I'm not letting up.
Schneider's in thereÂ installing a bar in the tub as we speak.
Oh, fantastic.
Now I can have a mojito while I bathe.
Not that kind of bar.
Hey! Hey! Hey! So youÂ can avoid repetitive stress, I put your curtains on remote control.
[motor whirs] You should have let me die.
Okay, I installed the shower bar.
- I'll straighten it later.
- Appreciate that.
And then, oh, my god [laughs] Mateo did this funny Nikki impersonation.
"Hi, I'm Nikki.
I'm terrible.
" You got to see him do it.
Enough about Mateo already.
Just admit it, you like him.
Yeah, of course.
He's my buddy.
No, but you like him.
You guys should have seen her, smiling and laughing.
Ooh! So, you're crushing on a DILF, eh? You want me to talk to him? DILF to DILF? You're not a dad.
And you're definitely not an ILF.
I hear you, and yes, I will be your wingman at the fundraiser.
Once again, I'm donating handyman for a day.
Oh, that thing you do every year where Nikki outbids everyone, and you two go home together? That only happened three years in a row.
This year is different because I know better.
Nikki's toxic, and after spendingÂ time with her I always feel like I'm drowning in shame.
Yeah, you're going home with Nikki.
[sighs] I know.
So? What's wrong with this Mateo? Nothing, he's just not my type.
He's nice.
He's kind of a dork.
Like he's definitely been stuffed in a locker.
So what does this Mateo do? He is an accountant.
- Ay.
- No.
[chuckles] It's fine.
It's just I like a guy who can handle his business.
Someone who can take charge when I need him to.
And look, he just doesn't give me that [groans] - Mom, no! - Stop it! I get it.
I would look across the room at your father and I would go [groans] No! Stop making sounds and moving! No, it's a feeling you get in your stomach.
It's deep, it's physical, and once you feel it you can't ignore it.
- That's right.
- Yeah, I get that when I eat soft cheese.
Anyway, Mateo and me, no, - never gonna happen.
- Yeah.
You're in the friend zone anyway.
Can't crawl out of that.
Oh, I could if I wanted to.
I have a foolproof move I've been using since high school.
Spill a little liquid on the girls, then suddenly my eyes are no longer up here.
[chuckles] There's this kid in my class, Joe Kamacho, who has to wear a hearing aid.
And I've never been so jealous in my life.
I can't find my dancing shoes.
I need them for the auction tomorrow.
I took them.
You can't wear high heels anymore.
Excuse me? The doctor was very clear.
You are on blood thinners, you are prone to dizzy spells, so you can't wear high heels anymore, y ya! You do not "y ya" me.
I "y ya" you.
Y ya! [motor whirs] Thank you for wearing flats, and thank youÂ for agreeing to auction off knitting lessons instead of dance lessons.
And thank you for always knowing what everybody else should do.
I will admit it's kind of weird to see you without heels.
Now when you stand next Dr.
B.
you only come up to his armpit.
Yet she still looks down on me.
- And you love it.
- I do.
Okay.
Ah, the library is only open for one more hour, and I feelÂ the need, the need to read.
What a novel idea.
[both laugh] Lydia, I think these knitting lessons are gonna be a big hit.
They will be, because now they are dance lessons.
I thought Elena hid all of your heels.
No, these are my emergency heels.
My abuela taught me to keep a pair in the freezer in case of fire, flood, or flamenco.
Oh, still cold.
Elena is going to see you in these shoes.
Not if I stand behind my table.
And, Leslie, snitches get stitches.
But she's going to see that you're taller than my armpit.
I already thought of that.
Put on your heels, cowboy.
- Look at you.
- Look at you! You ditched the cargo shorts, huh? Yeah, I'm trying to dress better.
My son said I look like a dork, who no one would ever date.
What? I unloaded all the heat lamps in the parking lot, okay? The parking lot? No, we need them on the quad like an hour ago.
Sorry.
Hang on.
Stu? Here's what gonna happen.
You're gonna move them on to the quad, and because you were late, you're gonna take another 20 percent off.
Because I'll tell you, every parentÂ here is looking down the barrel of a sweet 16 party, and we wouldn't want wordÂ to get out that you don't deliver things on time.
Would we? Right.
Sorry, sir.
I'll take care of it.
What? Nothing.
Oops.
What up, klutz? Here's a napkin.
Hey, Pete.
What the hell, guys? Hi, Schneider.
No.
Maybe.
Darn it, no! I love our little tradition where handyman for a day becomes handyman for a night, and then leaves right after.
Okay.
While I appreciate your business, this year, can we give a chance to someone who wants me for what's in my tool belt and not Well, this metaphor's not working out.
Just don't bid.
Oops, too late.
That's just a drawing of a This is a school! [typewriter dings] [keys clack] Is that a Remington Deluxe Model 5? Good ear.
His name's Belmondo.
That's crazy.
I have a hammer named Lorenzo.
Are you making fun of me? No, look, look.
[chuckles] It's a pleasure to meet you, Lorenzo.
And I am Lorenzo's colleague, Schneider.
Avery.
So are you a parent or a teacher or a student? Please don't say student.
Well, I'm I teach kindergarten.
But really I'm a poet.
I'm selling custom poems.
No kidding.
I type them onto paper I make at home from recycled phone books.
And my ribbon is loaded with cuttlefish ink.
Cuttlefish is my favorite cephalopod ink.
- How's business? - Not great.
Oh, a customer! Catch you later, neighbor.
Hi.
Did I eat soft cheese? Let's see how many bids we have, huh? - Ay.
- Oh, sugar.
These boots were not made for walking.
Leslie, back to the corral! Elena's coming.
Dr.
Berkowitz, why are you wearing cowboy boots? There's a long-storied history of Jewish cowboys.
Yippee-ki-oy vey! Abuelita, you can't be wearing those high heels, and what happened to theÂ knitting lessons? You are putting yourself in serious danger.
You're not some kid at the Havana club anymore, you're an old woman.
And you think an old woman could do this? [vocalizes in rhythm] Woo! Fine.
Clearly you don't care what Mom or me or the doctor says.
I give up.
That was very impressive.
Most women your age would have twisted an ankle.
[hoarsely] I did.
[groans] [clears throat] Is Belmondo acting up? Sure is.
Keys are jammed.
Oh.
Let me take a look.
You're really good with those tools.
Oh, thanks.
I like pretty much anything mechanical.
To me, all these gears, springs, and levers working in unison is like poetry, you know? I do.
Plus, with a typewriter, you can create something that lasts forever.
Something permanent you can you can hold and cherish.
[typewriter dings] Belmondo is fixed.
Oh! Are you okay? All right, Abuelita, time to go.
And no needÂ to be dramatic.
You win.
You're free to make your own choices about your health, even if those choices are stupid and can put you back in aÂ coma.
You finally get it.
[winces] [chuckles] Interesting items.
Abuelita.
Did you hurt yourself? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm simply interested in vaginal I hurt my ankle.
Okay.
Dr.
B.
Can you please give us a hand? We need to get her to the car.
Of course.
[yells] [Dr.
Berkowitz] I might need some help as well.
I've been outbid.
You have? By who? By me.
Well, I have a tradition to maintain, so Well, I'm not much for tradition, so I've had this dream.
This is getting boring.
[clears throat] Whoa, she wrote a lot of zeros and turned two of them in the boobs.
I, umI can't compete with that.
Will you excuse me for one second? Yeah.
No, Nikki.
No, no, no.
I'm breaking this cycle, this dance of death that we do.
I know Avery and I just met, but she's making me feel things that I've never feltÂ before.
Okay, bring her.
Really? No, no, no, no! [exclaims] [clears throat] So Um, did you really mean what you said about me? Yeah.
I had a really nice time meeting you and Belmondo tonight.
Us too.
In fact, we wrote you a poem.
Oh.
This is really experimental.
[chuckles] That's my phone number.
Got ya.
Thanks.
I will be calling.
Wow, it's justit's so refreshing to meet someone at one of these things that isn't a a privileged, rich, trust-fund baby.
We are so on the same page.
It's crazy.
Congratulations, we did it.
[both] Woo-woo! Yeah, we did such a great job that Nikki will take all the credit for it at theÂ PTA meeting.
Hey, you know what? I was thinking that you and me, we should go out sometime.
Go out? Yeah, you know, grab a drink, see a movie.
Call the heat lamp company, start yelling.
I don't know, date stuff.
Um I don't think we should.
Okay.
I mean, you're the only parent here I actually like.
We're friends.
I'd really hate to mess that up.
- Right? - Right, yeah.
Then we'd be stuck with each other for four more awkward years.
Yeah, no, totally.
But I am so flattered.
- 'Cause you - Yeah, I know, all good.
I hope I didn't make it weird.
No, come on, no.
All good.
[sighs] Here you go, Abuelita.
This should help with the swelling.
Thank you.
Now can we talk about getting rid of the high heels? - [sighs] - Elena, please, give the woman a moment's peace.
I'm just used to taking her side.
I don't even know what you guys are talking about.
Abuelita please.
I haven't slept since I saw you lying in that hospital bed.
I am so worried that something is going to happen to you, and you're beingÂ stubborn about a silly pair of shoes.
Mija.
It's not just about the shoes.
It'sonce the heels go, what's next? I don't want to put them on a shelf and remember who I was.
I want to be who I am.
My abuela, Maria Luisa.
She wore her four-inch ruby stilettos everywhere, even snorkeling.
Oh, boy, she was a strong woman.
And she remained elegant.
In spite of living in the world that was not always beautiful.
And she was who she was.
Until the day she died.
- I also have a really strong abuelita.
- [chuckles] And I want to keep her strong.
So do you think that she can be who she is in a slightly lower heel? For me? For you? Maybe she could try.
If the shoes are sufficiently stylish, with a little platform, and a bit of sparkle.
Deal.
Okay.
And you know, maybe sometimes you can use the cane.
- Take theÂ win.
- Okay.
I want to make an announcement.
Mami, what happened to the motor? Oh, so tragic.
It broke when it was hit several times by a cane, which also broke.
So what's your announcement? I realize that there are many things I still want to do with my life.
So I made a bouquet list.
Do you mean a bucket list? No, that makes no sense.
It is a bouquet list because it is an arrangement of all of the beautiful things you still want to do before you kick the bucket.
What'd you put on it? To sing in front of a big band again, hold myÂ grandchildren's children, have someone explainÂ Star Wars to me.
Okay.
"A long time ago - in a galaxy far, far away" - Check.
Done.
[knock on door] Mateo? Is everything okay? - Can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure.
What's up? Earlier you asked if I wanted to go out with you and I said no.
I remember.
I said I wanted to protect the friendship.
Yeah, that happened like an hour ago.
I remember stuff, I'm not freaking Memento.
I actually don't want to be friends with you.
Okay, well, that could have been an email.
Sorry.
I'm not great at this.
It's been 15 years.
The thing is, when you spilled water on your It's like I saw you in a brand new way.
Huh! Interesting.
Go on.
And then you asked me out and I panicked.
I mean, I haven't been on a date since I split with my wife.
Mateo Are you asking me on a date? I am.
I actually started thinking about it and I don't think it's a good idea.
Remember five seconds ago when you asked me out, I said no, but I meant to say yes? [Lydia] Stop toying with the man! Invite him in so he can see what you will look like in ten years! [theme music plays]
Man, I'm so jealous.
Chloe and her family are going on a ski trip for the break.
They're staying in a hotel room with two rooms.
It's called a "suite.
" Fool, I've seen Basketball Wives, I know what a suite is.
- We never go on vacation.
- Oh, yes, we do.
You just don't know because last time we went, you were too young to form memories.
Where do you think your Mickey Mouse ears came from? The Dollar Store.
They're not even Mickey Mouse, they're Ricky Rat.
Can you whine about your sad little life somewhere else? I'm doing my SAT prep.
I have a 1,000 words to learn! I have two words for you.
You're a dingus.
That's three words, dingus! Hey! Can I have five minutes of peace with you two? It is true.
Those two have been fighting a lot.
Elena, stop it.
Maybe we do need a little R&R.
Oh.
Oye.
Why don't we go visit your brother in Seattle? It is on my bouquet list.
Mami, Tito travels for a living.
If he wants to see us, he can come here.
You know, the way he did when you were clinging to life in the hospital.
Oh, right, that was everybody but him.
You are always so hard on him.
Mami, whatever.
I get it.
- He's the boy.
He can do no wrong.
- Ugh! You really embrace that Cuban stereotype.
That's why Tito he is.
Confident, handsome, and successful? Then hashtag, no regrets.
I don't know.
Where would we even go on vacation? Tito has been helping open restaurants all over the world.
He could make sure that we have an amazing vacation.
Well, guess what? So can I.
Pack your bags, people, we are going on vacation.
It's gonna be great, and it's gonna bring us closer than ever.
- [shouts] Move over! - You move over! [yells] [cars honk] This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [cars honk] Lupe I think we should have taken another way to San Diego.
Really, Mami? Because I picked this route just so we can sit next to the power plant that looks like a boobs for half an hour! It's okay.
It's all gonna be worth it.
- [car honks] - [scoffs] Look at this guy behind us all mad at me.
What? What, dumbass? Oh, my blinker's on.
Oh.
Sorry.
Callow.
"Juvenile and immature.
" And look, it's a picture of you.
Elena, stop reading in the car, you know it makes youÂ nauseous.
[car honks] Oh, please, sir, just go right ahead.
Oh, I'm on the shoulder.
This sucks.
Why didn't we just fly to San Diego? Your abuelita refuses to fly.
Planes are the trash cans of the sky.
Everybody knows this.
Mami, I don't feel so good.
[chuckles] Mami, it's not funny.
I know, but when Elena throws up she makes the funny sound.
Like a sad foghorn.
[vomits like a foghorn] I'm sorry, baby.
Like a drunken moose.
[laughs] Ay, Dios mio! Oh, really, no, I couldn't stay.
Hmm? Ah, I agree, we should redo the family portraits.
Hello, Schneider.
Lydia asked me to water her plant.
Oh! [chuckles] She must've not known that Pen asked me to do it.
Don't worry, I got this.
No, no.
No inconvenience.
Don't you live in Encino? Just a 55-minute drive each way.
I don't mind.
I want to do it.
But I have all the equipment.
But I have nothing else in my life! [sprays] [sighs] Well, we did that.
I should probably be getting to the rest of my day.
Yeah.
Time for me to go home.
Alone.
Sit in the dark.
And weep into my body pillow.
You know if you leave now, you'll probably be hitting some crazy traffic.
Rush hour starts at four.
What time is it? One.
[Schneider] Oh.
We should just eat.
There's a great new Italian place around the corner.
Or We could just stay here and cook.
Yes! Ah! Que damn fancy.
They even spell motel with an H.
Mom, how can we afford this? You don'tÂ need money when you know how to play the game.
I put together a combo of my student ID, USAA, and AAA discount.
Also if anyone asks, I'm a travel agent.
[Elena vomits like a foghorn] [Elena] And the bathroom's so nice! Guys, come here, check it out.
We have a view of the pool.
Dang, that's a lot of bikinis.
Don't forget the talk we had about respecting women.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's hearts behind the boobs.
Those are some big hearts.
My vacation is already bringing you two together.
Okay, that's enough.
- Mami.
- Huh? Look what I got you.
A Bible? - And you arranged for this.
- Yeah.
She don't know.
Alright, let's grab some snacks and go down to the pool.
Oh, the children already drank their sodas on the way here.
Well, no problem.
We'll just grab some from the minibar.
[all gasp] Mom, you said minibars were introduced by the CIA to punish poor people.
Mami, no! The weight sensor! Who do you think you're talking to? Sandbag! Abuelita, get the Bible.
Ba-bam! We'll replace it later.
Oh, and while we're here, you two are 12-year-old twins.
And I will not claim I'm a senior citizen.
No one will believe it.
- You don't have to 'cause you're not here.
- Huh? It was cheaper to say it's just me and the kids.
- They probably won't come up.
- [knock on door] Mami get in the closet! [Elena gasps] Act like twins! Tito.
LlegÃ³ la fiesta.
LlegÃ³ la fiesta LlegÃ³ la fiestaÂ  Ha! [laughs] What are you doing here? Mami called me.
- TÃ­o! - Elena.
- Hey, TÃ­o.
- Alex, wassup? Buh-buh-buh-bup.
Wait for it.
Ba-bam! Ba-bam! - Love you.
- Thanks, TÃ­o.
Love you.
Mami, you can come out.
It's Tito.
Elena, that is how you come out of the closet.
Tito.
[laughs] Ah.
[smooches] ["You Make My Dreams" plays] You make my dreams come trueÂ  You, ooh, oohÂ  YouÂ  Well, well, well, youÂ  Oh, yeah You make my dreams come true You, ooh, oohÂ  Girl, yeah YouÂ  On a night when bad dreams become a screamer When they're messin' with a dreamerÂ  I can laugh it in the faceÂ  Twist and shout my way outÂ  [music stops] I just don't think that the infrastructure is there to handle the water needs of our exploding population.
I hear you.
And with the clouds moving away from the equator, towards the poles, we're talking about a real crisis.
[both sigh] [music resumes] Oh, you Girl, yeah You make my dreams come trueÂ  Oh, yeahÂ  Wasn't Tito so wonderful to travel to us? He is a hero.
You remember I'm a war veteran, right? What? I mean, isn't it nice to see his face again? - I made that face with sex from your papi.
- What? So he doesn't show up when you're in the hospital, but he gets to horn in on the vacation that I didn't sleep for three nights, planning? You know he was abroad.
He called me.
He would've been there if he could.
Oye, who wants to go to the pool? I hooked us up with a cabana.
Anything you have to hook up, I'm in.
Oh, and I have a great place for us to have dinner out later.
That's alright, 'cause I already made a reservation at a place calledÂ Veranda.
They offer a big discount if you eat before six, and it's the twins' birthday.
Oh, yeah, that place is great.
But is it on a boat? What?! I am so over land restaurants! Papito, you are so smart.
All restaurants should be on boats.
Okay, as long as it's okay with you.
I don't want to step on your toes, or get nearÂ them, Lupita stinky feeta.
[laughs] I forgot about that one.
Whatever, Tito little pito.
Lupita, that is just plain mean.
[crickets chirping] [Schneider sighs] You think there's life on other planets? I hope so.
I always thought I have an alien-ish physique.
Oh, you would crush it on another planet, Doc.
Man, before I got sober I never would have been able to enjoy something like this.
I always thought I needed drugs to see the beauty in things.
Well, I've just gotten into drugs myself, and, uh I've been using these medical marijuana lozenges to help me relax.
They're called Lemon Dopes.
That is one relaxed lemon.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.
I can be around it.
Doesn't bother me.
Now.
I just need them to help me sleep, yeah.
I'm such an old-guyÂ clichÃ©.
You know, with the tossing and the turning and the constant night terrors with my ex-wife and daughters strangling me.
Oh, my god, that sounds awful.
Just my ex is strangling me.
My daughters are filling my pockets with rocks.
I don't know much about dreams.
Maybe it means something good.
[sighs] Our minds are such mysteries.
How long have you been sober? Almost eight years.
Wow.
That is really impressive.
I can't even imagine the strength that must have taken.
Ah.
I'm proud of you, Schneider.
[whispers] You are? Absolutely.
[exhales deeply] Do you know how long I've waited for any sort of father figure to say that to me? You think of me as a father figure? Of course.
You're my father, and Penelope is my muchÂ older sister.
I'm the miracle baby.
I'm sorry I'm getting so emotional.
My kids think of me as a failure figure.
Well, not this kid.
Ah, that ocean.
Takes me back to Cuba.
It was on a night like this, when I debuted as a dancer, and I wore my mami's heels.
And my lean calves looked like they had been chiseled out of marble.
But when I stepped on the dance floor I suddenly saw [both imitate Lydia] My sister Maruchi had also entered the competition.
I am so happy that I brought you into this world to laugh at me.
Because of your giant heads, I pee when I cough.
Okay.
I'm gonna go out on the deck and take some photos for my Insta.
Yeah, it's been ten minutes.
People might start believing you actually have a life.
[coughs] Bite me.
Hey, hey.
Come on.
Elena, go with your brother.
Haven't I already thrown up enough today? No one is wandering around alone.
We're on a boat.
- Where could I go? - Overboard? It happens all the time.
Have you not seen that movie Overboard? Or that other movie, the remake of Overboard? Well, I'm going.
Remember Mami never let us go to the freezer section of the supermarket alone because we might accidentally get trapped in there? [imitates Lydia] "In the freezer no one can hear you scream.
" [both imitate] "Everybody knows this.
" So did you freeze to death? You're welcome.
- Heard you were here.
- Bruce.
Tito was key in getting us that crucial fifth anchor in Restaurant Boat Magazine, so, uh consider all your wine on the house.
Oh, in that case, we'll have another bottle, or five.
Just kidding, four will do.
Well, we also have him to thank for getting us up in time for Fouth of July.
- It is great seeing you again, brother.
- [Tito] Same here.
[clears throat] You were here for the Fourth? So you were a two-hour drive away when Mami was in the hospital after her stroke.
[Lydia murmurs] You were working, far away.
Mami Well, I'm sure you had your reasons.
Permiso.
What's up? El Capitan here.
Living that yacht life.
Right now I'm up on her stern.
That means her butt.
Peace.
[chuckles] Nice, so just because a boat is something someone can own, it has to be a woman.
I'm sorry.
I'll ask the boat what its preferred pronoun is.
God, you are so insensitive.
Okay, I get it, you hate me.
What? No, I don't.
It just seems like everything I say makes you mad.
So? Everything everyone says makes me mad.
Well, it just makes me not want to talk to you.
Honestly, I didn't think you listened to me.
I mean, you're always on your phone or with your stupid friends.
Yeah.
And you're always saying that you hate my friends, and that I'm exactly like them, so I told you, I don't hate you.
I mean, sometimes I wanna kill you, but just like in the normal way.
I only want to kill you in the normal way too.
But yeah, I'm glad you don't hate me.
Of course I don't, stupid.
I don't want us to end up like TÃ­o and Mami.
I mean, they barely talk.
That'll never be us.
Have you met yourself? You like to talka lot.
Besides, we need each other.
Yeah, we do.
[both] To deal with Mom.
Aww.
We got that twin thing.
Remember when we were little, Mami wouldn't let us go on the seesaw 'cause we weren't the same weight? "You're gonna launch your brother into freaking space!" Plus, some day I want nieces and nephews to throw cash at, like TÃ­o Tito.
I'm not having any kids.
Thenyour cats.
That is such a stereotype.
But yes, there will be cats.
Hey, how about this? I will take a picture of you for Instagram, if you stop talking about the boat's butt.
Okay.
And for every pic you take of me, I'll quiz you on a vocabulary word.
Deal.
[camera clicks] Nice work.
You really got my jawline.
Narcissism.
[laughs] Oh, come on.
[laughs] You are unbelievable.
Look, I didn't visit Mami at the hospital because I knew she wouldn't want me to see her like that.
- You know how she is.
- What's your point? She also would've preferred to die on the floor rather than letÂ EMTs see her without lipstick.
She needed you there, and you didn't show up.
Just like when Papi died.
What you talking about? I was there.
- For the funeral, that's it.
- [scoffs] Who do you think had to make all the arrangements? - Me.
- Yeah, I paid for everything.
- I don't want your freaking money.
- Right.
[chuckles] Papi was gone, Mami was in pieces, and you were nowhere to be found.
I was wrecked after Papi died.
We were all wrecked.
But too freaking bad, because we are the grown-ups now.
And we both have to step it up.
You've always been the grown-up.
Right? I mean, that's what you do.
You're the superwoman.
When Mami was in the hospital, I couldn't do it.
Lupe, I could not see Mami like that.
Bad stuff is gonna happen, Tito.
And next time we might not be so lucky.
We might lose her.
Am I gonna lose you, too? I know we have our things, but I miss you.
Jerk.
I miss you, too.
- Jerk.
- [chuckles] And you know, good stuff is gonna happen too.
And I really want you there for that.
[sniffles] You're right.
I'm sorry.
I love you, Lupita.
I love you too, Tito little pito.
I love you even if you are Mami's favorite.
Ay.
What? - What? Shut up! No.
- It's true.
I know I get all the press, but, look, if this boat goes down, you know who she's saving.
- Alex.
- Yeah.
But then you.
- You know this viejita did this to us.
- [scoffs] I think she thinks you're perfect.
You think she thinks I'm perfect.
Really, I just think she thinks she's perfect.
She kinda is.
Yeah, she kinda is.
But crazy.
Oh, off the rails.
Se el tren hace rato.
[laughs] Hey, uh - Does she still talk to Papi? - Oh, yeah.
They never been stronger.
They go on dates.
Who pays? That's your question? [foghorn sounds] Hey, guys, check out these pictures Alex took of me.
He taught me how to "smeyes.
" That means smile with my eyes.
Oh? - I'm still working on it.
- Oh.
I'm just glad you two are getting along.
Yeah.
Our consanguinity has never been more indubitable.
Say what? Oye.
I'm sorry for not coming to see you when you were sick.
Oh - It's okay.
- No.
No, it isn't.
It was selfish.
It'll never happen again.
I don't know what I would do if I lost you.
Ay, Papito.
[sniffles] Te quiero tanto.
Y yo te, Mami.
[sniffles] Oye.
[clears throat] Mirada I'm gonna be around more.
No.
- Yes? - Yeah.
Pupita has really been on my fotingo about it.
[Lydia laughs] She's right.
I guess, uh, we're both pretty lucky to have her.
Ay, Penelopita.
Can you believe how selfless he is to compliment you? I did not think it was possible, but now you are even more perfect than ever.
[Elena vomits like a foghorn] Me too, baby.
Shields up! Let's move that payload.
Go, Gladiators! So, you are not even playing this video game? You're just watching these other nerds playing the video game? This is the Overwatch League.
It's the world's top e-athletes.
E-who cares? [knock on door] That sounds like a weak-wristed knock.
Come in, Leslie.
[panting] Hi, everybody.
Exciting news.
I got two extra tickets to the opera.
Penelope, I was thinking maybe you and Mateo may want to come.
Thank you so much for the offer, but I just can't.
I'm completely swamped with disinterest.
Are you sure? Opera-tunity only knocks once.
Ay, Leslie, no.
Maybe I can take those tickets.
Since when did you get into the opera, Elena? Well, I've been looking for an opera-tunity to go out on the town with my Syd-nificant other.
[Elena and Leslie laugh] Berto, I am ready.
No? Ah.
Hey, Mom, can I go skydiving? You're right, too dangerous.
I'll just go to the concert Dylan invited me to instead.
Much safer.
Thanks.
Yeah, nice try.
Few questions.
What concert is it? Where is it? Can I come? Oh, wait.
You're not going.
Please, Mom, it's Bud E.
Fest, this really chill outdoor music festival.
No! You could get kidnapped, trampled, or molested.
You never let me do anything because you always think I'm gonna get molested.
And have you ever been molested? No.
You're welcome.
Sorry, buddy, but you ain't going to Buddy Fest.
Please, Mom.
There will be tons of security.
Plus, it's outdoors during the day.
It's basically a church picnic.
Look.
Come on, I'm 15.
How old were you when you went to your first concert? Seventeen.
Lisa Lisa.
What are you talking about? Twenty-three, and we saw Julio Iglesias.
Mami, that's right.
That Lisa Lisa thing was a crazy dream that I had that I snuck out to a concert, but really, I was home that night in bed, sleeping like two pillows under a blanket.
Well, I would never dream of sneaking out.
That's why I'm asking you.
'Cause I'm a good kid who tells his mother everything.
If you want to go to a concert, why don't you come with us to the opera? We have two extra tickets.
But I'm using those.
Oh, yeah.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Schneider, I need to talk.
Sure.
I'm not doing anything.
Is this a jigsaw puzzle? Of my family? The only missing piece is me.
Well, I'm sorry for bursting in.
I'm really sorry.
Um, but I am worried about Alex.
Oh, don't be.
Once I get the outline of his head, the face will be easy.
Not that.
He's at a concert I let him go to.
I think I made a terrible mistake.
I remember my first concert in Canada.
Bryan Adams at the Chilliwack Moose Lodge.
Man, that mosh pit was wild.
There was a mosh pit at a Bryan Adams concert? Every concert has a mosh pit.
A girlfriend once took me to see Streisand, I almost lost an eye during "You Don't Bring Me Flowers.
" Okay, this is not helping me get over my crazy yet completely justified Cuban overprotectiveness! Look, at some point, you're going to have to start trusting Alex.
It's not like you can go everywhere with him and spy on him.
Or [hip hop music plays] Yeah, I think we blend in pretty well.
Well, I'm glad we came.
Yeah, this place actually seems pretty safe.
There's a lot of security.
Yeah, concerts have gotten so refined since my day.
I just got my beard trimmed at the grooming tent.
I was gonna get eyelash extensions, but the line was too long.
Seriously, that porta potty is nicer than my bathroom.
It has three-ply toilet paper.
Well, it did.
Okay, so Alex should be somewhere in that section over there.
Okay.
Here, I brought my binoculars.
Great.
What theWhat? Oh.
Whoops.
These are my bar-noculars.
I've been sober so long, I forgot I had these.
God! Oh, no, I'm not doing my move.
No.
Still works.
Yeah, anyway, I don't need binoculars because I made Alex wear a long-sleeve shirt so he wouldn't catch pneumonia.
A red-and-white striped shirt.
- Oh, my god, you Waldoed him! - Yup.
Oh! There's Waldito.
Oh.
Well, it looks like he's doing okay.
Wait.
Why is he holding a pen? Maybe he wants to get an autograph.
He's putting the pen in his mouth.
I do the same thing.
It's a bad habit.
Oh, it's a worse habit than you think.
Pen, he's vaping.
Pen, vaping.
Vape pen, Pen.
Vape Oh, my god.
I did not even mean to do that.
Maybe it's just nicotine.
[Penelope] "Bud E.
Fest"? I cannot believe this concert is promoting marijuana! I wondered why Wiz Khalifa and Willie Nelson were performing at the same show.
So aria ready for some opera? I give that pun a tenor so.
[laughs] You think I would survive this fall? These seats are awesome.
Thank you so much for the ticket hookup, Dr.
B.
No problem.
It's a double date.
Double date? Who's the couple they're with? I am so excited.
I read that the part of Annio is a trouser role, a male part played by an actress in men's clothing.
Really? So this opera is gender-nonconforming! Like you.
You make everything gay.
Even the opera is gay to you.
What is next? Ballet? [scoffs] You really didn't have to drag me out of that concert.
How'd you get to me through those people? I had to crowd-surf across 2,000 hands.
And yes, I am aware of the irony that, technically, I am the one that ended up getting molested.
I cannot believe you were smoking pot.
I wasn't smoking,Â I was vaping.
Well, in that case, all good.
- Really? - No! How long has this been going on? It was my first time.
And last time.
Dylan's brother had it and everybody was trying it.
I didn't even like it.
It was stupid.
It was stupid.
Stupid of me to trust you.
Well, I won't be making that mistake again.
Because the next time you're allowed to go to a concert, it'll be so far in the future, robots will rule the galaxy.
And music will have been outlawed anyway.
What? I don't know.
I'm very upset! It's not that big of a deal.
It's not as bad as alcohol and everyone drinks.
You even smell like booze.
I think.
What does booze even smell like? Don't be cute.
You're grounded.
Go to your room.
[sighs] [coughs] - [opera aria plays] - This opera's just so long.
And not enough intermissions when you have the bladder of a hummingbird.
Getting up in the middle of a solo? So disruptive.
[coughs loudly] Abuelita, you okay? I'm[coughs] I'm fine.
Do you have something to drink? Ah! [chuckles] You accidentally brought your real opera glasses instead of the ones filled with rum? What about a lozenge? Oh, Leslie has some.
[coughs] Ah.
Do you feel better now, Abuelita? So he shows me a drill and I say, "You better put that thing away or you're gonna need a dentist.
" So, whatever.
Now I'm banned from Home Depot.
Thank you, Ramona.
And I think that completes the entire Westfield Mall.
Well, I have something to share.
Um, this afternoon, I went to Bud E.
Fest.
- Yeah, you did.
- Nice.
I didn't know you smoked weed.
I went there to spy on my son.
Oh, that sounds more like you.
Yeah.
And I caught Alex smoking or whatever, vaping pot.
That stuff was everywhere.
It was like right out in the open.
Well, it is legal now.
I'm more of a Chardonnay and Tylenol PM gal myself.
Out like a light.
Responsibly.
I don't smoke since I'm sober, but, boy, did I like it.
Not me.
Weed make me paranoid, like everyone's out to get me.
'Cause when you're black, everyone is.
Well, marijuana has really helped me.
With the pain from your injury? Sure, we'll say that.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Yes, big time.
I mean, a lot of vets I know were prescribed opiates and couldn't get off of them.
Yeah, it's a big problem.
Yeah, my ex was one of them.
I smoke weed on occasion.
It's really chilled me out.
What were you like before? [laughs] Look, weed is just not my thing.
I mean, I get how it can be helpful or even kind of fun.
Of course I've tried it, but Alex can't know that.
He needs to think I'm perfect.
I think you're perfect.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little high right now.
Okay, well, we're adults.
Alex is 15.
That's true.
At that age, the brain is still developing.
So did you go all Home Depot on him? Okay, first of all, that's not a phrase normal people use.
And, no.
It was a one-time thing and he gets it now.
In fact, I didn't overreact.
I was understanding, but clear and firm.
One and done.
Nipped it in the bud.
[laughter] Oh, no.
I wasn't trying to make a bud pun, but that was funny.
[laughs] No, we're laughing at how you think it was Alex's first time.
Yeah, it's cute.
That's what everyone says when they're teenagers.
"I didn't even like it.
" That's what Alex said.
Oh, my god.
- Did you search his room? - No.
- You've gotta search.
- What's wrong with you? Okay.
Well, I will now.
And if I find any marijuana, it's going right down the toilet.
Whoa.
Let's not be hasty! Pen, can you take a picture of me so I can Photoshop myself into the puzzle? Shh! What are you doing? Alex is downstairs doing punishment laundry, so I'm secretly searching his room for drugs.
But the women at the therapy group got me all worried for nothing.
I went over every inch of this room, I didn't find anything.
Here you go.
Fake deodorant? How did you know? You're like one of those dogs at the airport.
I have a lot of experience hiding drugs.
They used to call me "The Mole.
" 'Cause of the mole on my butt cheek.
Next to where I hid my drugs.
Let's focus on Alex.
I cannot believe he lied about it being a one-time thing.
Though I am happy he doesn't really use Flex body spray.
What the hell is all this stuff? When I was a kid, you had to roll a joint or smoke it out of an apple.
We used to make bongs out of maple syrup jugs.
You could walk down the street toking, people wouldn't even notice.
They'd just think you were another hoser your chuggin' syrup.
Do you think Alex has a real drug problem? No.
Look, there's some left.
That's a good sign.
Trust me.
It's probably just Alex being a teenager.
You'll deal with it.
He's great kid and you're an amazing mom.
Am I? I kind of feel like I failed.
Look, if it helps, I know this stuff looks intense, but it's actually one of the weakest forms of marijuana.
Really? Yeah.
Dr.
B's got these lozenges.
He says they go straight into your bloodstream.
If you're not used to it, they can really whack you out.
You're fine one moment, then it kicks in.
Next thing you know, you're giggling uncontrollably.
- [opera aria playing] - [snickers] [guffaws loudly] It is gay! [Lydia laughs loudly] I get it.
I get it.
Then you get all paranoid.
[opera aria playing] [gasps] The Castros have found me! One guy I knew actually popped one at a movie theater and started talking back to the screen.
Give it up, Titus! Servilia only wants you as a friend! Like Leslie and me! Shh! Oh, my stars! [sings operatically] Thank god no one in my family is using that stuff.
- Looking for this? - No! What is that? Don't even.
This is what you're doing? I'm busting my ass for this family, and you're out there doing this crap? - I'm sorry, I - You lied right to my face.
I had to.
If I didn't lie, you would've said I couldn't do it.
'Cause you shouldn't do it! It's not that bad.
- It's legal now.
- Yeah.
You know what else is legal? Smoking, drinking, gambling.
But you end up with cancer,Â cirrhosis, and prying your abuelita off the penny slots.
And none of those things are legal for you 'cause you're 15.
It's just a fun thing we do once in awhile.
Anyways, I get straight As.
You want for long if you're a stoner.
I'm not a stoner.
We laugh at those guys.
Besides, tons of successful people have smoked weed.
Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Oprah.
Unemployed, dead, and Gayle just said that to get ratings.
And trust me, for every success, there are a hundred losers whose lives never go anywhere.
And you really think it's healthy for you? You know that guy at the concert, Willie Nelson? Thirty-two years old.
No, he's not.
He's like your age.
No, he's not like my age! He's a lot older than me! [Penelope sighs] I am so disappointed in you.
You're a good kid, you're a smart kid, and you should know better.
I'm sorry I'm not perfect like you.
Trust me, I'm not perfect.
I tried pot a couple of times.
You did? Yeah, I was stupid too.
So, I get the curiosity.
But when you're a kid, it messes with your brain because it's still developing.
And you need to be especially careful because you're Latino.
Why? When I was 17, a cop caught me and my friend smoking pot at the beach.
I got dragged into the police station.
But my friend, Caroline, who was white, and I'm talking sunburn-at-night white, the cop let her go with a warning.
You got arrested? Oh, my god.
Abuelita must've freaked.
[scoffs] She don't know.
Luckily, there was a Latino cop working the desk who felt sorry for me and let me go, but not before he said, "You can't be doing this kind of stuff.
It's different for us.
" He was right.
So the reality is, if a white kid like Dylan gets caught with a little weed, he gets a cool story.
But you? You could end up in prison.
Your life will be over, and so will mineÂ because I couldn't bear to lose you like that.
I'm sorry, Mami.
I'll never do it again.
Oh.
I would love to believe you.
But one of these days, I'm gonna make you use this.
A pregnancy test? No, it's a drug test, but now I'm concerned that you know what a pregnancy test looks like.
You know what? Another day.
Anyway, this is gonna happen, and your pee better be freaking perfect.
It will be, I swear.
[sniffs] Mmm.
You are using Flex body spray.
How many times in one day are you gonna disappoint me? And did you know that smoking marijuana can also cause gynecomastia? - What is that? - That's when men grow boobs.
Why didn't you just lead with that?! We could've skipped the rest of the conversation! [whimpers] I think we caught it in time.
And one more thing.
Please don't tell Abuelita what I did.
I don't want to disappoint her too.
Baby, I would never do that.
I don't need that in my life.
If she asks why you're grounded, we'll just say you're being punished for spending time with a girl who's a bad influence.
"Mary Jane.
" I get it.
Like Peter Parker's girlfriend.
No, it's Forget it.
Oh, wait.
You got to keep my pot story a secret too 'cause Abuelita would never understand.
So, we got banned from the opera.
Man, we killed that all-you-can-eat buffet.
Yup.
What? It says, "All you can eat.
" I will eat all of it.
This is on them.
Oh, I'm with you.
[laughs] What else you got in there? That's not what I Never mind.
Don't answer.
Hey, so, Valentine's Day is tomorrow.
We should do something, right? Look, I like flowers, chocolates, and a stupid teddy bear I'm gonna throw in the trash as much as the next girl.
But we've both been married before.
We know that Valentine's Day sucks.
Let's just skip it.
I have been married before.
This smells like a trap.
It's not a trap.
My family is going out.
I'm taking the day for myself, and you should do all the stuff that you like to do.
Whatever that is.
- We don't know each other that well.
- [chuckles] Okay.
Although, I was going use the occasion to make my big move since we haven't kissed yet.
No, no, don't talk about it.
What are you doing? Just making sure that I'm safely out of the friend zone.
You are out of the friend zone and you soon will have access to other zones.
- Okay, get out of here.
Get out.
- [chuckles] [together] Bye.
That was the saddest thing we have ever heard.
- [theme song playing] - This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feetÂ  Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Come on, everyone.
I love you all but I want you gone.
We are going to have so much fun at the viejitos lawn bowling tournament.
[in sing-song] Lawn bowl so hard, other chuckers want to find me.
[blows] That sounds like a hell of a date.
You must be anxious to get it started.
Don't be silly, Lupe.
Leslie is not my date.
He is the chaperone.
Who's your date? Let's get this bocce ball rolling.
You're really this excited about watching lawn bowling? I've been grounded for three weeks with no phone or TV.
Last week, I read a Jane Austen book for fun.
Yeah, remember you're still grounded, and the only reason I'm letting you go is 'cause this seems worse.
What do you think? I think I'm glad you two found each other.
We are celebrating.
This is our first Valentine's together, and my first time acknowledging Valentine's since all the other years I was at home making fun of it 'cause, really, I was sad.
Why does your head look like a butt? [chuckles] They're hearts.
We are not doing the typical corporate Valentine's Day.
I have planned an amazing day of service.
Syd and I are doing the Heart Healthy fun run.
Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of women? Second only to these dimples.
Papito, you are the number one lady killer.
[chuckles] You are the lady serial killer.
Okay, Mami, getting weird.
Anyway, what we're doing is perfect.
Yeah.
What else are we gonna do? Have an amazing time at Benihana marveling at a volcano onion? [laughs] Yeah, right.
Oh, good, you're all here.
Everybody, huddle up.
I need advice.
Listen, I'm begging you.
Make this quick.
- The Schneiders arrived in the New World.
- Quicker.
We got rich, but I told Avery, the girl that I'm dating, that I'm poor.
Sohow does that whole nightmare work? We're not poor, we're middle-class.
Yeah, that's good.
Tell me other things poor people say.
Just take her to your apartment.
Then she'll know I'm rich.
It's a shame, too, 'cause I just installed a hot tub and a high-tech Japanese toilet.
When you flush, it says, "Arigato.
" Take her to the Burbank Airport, watch the planes take off while eating Taco Bell drive-through.
Get her cinnamon twists if you want to go south of the border.
Bye! Damn, now I want Taco Bell.
What? You want me to steam my puka? Yeah, right.
Oh, fifty percent off.
Maybe.
[groans] What's happening? Couch nap.
[grunts] It's gonna hurt my back.
That's a tomorrow problem.
Hey! No, no, no.
Go away or I will stick my foot up your Avery! Oh, God.
It's so nice to see you.
What are you two doing here? Well, there we were at the Burbank Airport, watching planes and eating chalupas.
I believe it was Jenny from my block who said, "Love don't cost a thing.
" It was so fun.
Whenever a private plane would fly over us, the pilot would wave at Schneider like he knew him.
I got one of those faces.
Okay.
Anyway, um, I'm kind of doing an alone thing for Valentine's Day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It gets better.
No.
No, no, no.
This It's by choice, obviously.
I mean Well, I usually dress better.
[chuckles] I'm sorry.
We can we can totally head out.
[stammering] It's just thatHmm.
I live in one of those tiny houses, and my roommate wants to lie down.
So - And we don't feel like fighting the rain.
- What? Is it raining out there? Oh, yeah.
It's coming down like a waterfall in Bali.
I imagine.
The veijitas lawn bowling tournament turned into the veijitas wet T-shirt contest.
[groaning] No.
It was so beautiful on the outside.
I should have looked at the sky.
- Wait.
Where's Mami? - [groans] Don't look at me! A horrible truth has been revealed.
Papito, get me a straightening iron and the Bible.
Can't we just get an umbrella and go back out there? Are you crazy? Everybody knows that going outside with wet hair is almost as deadly as walking barefoot in your own home.
Ay, Mami, a little rain never hurt anyone.
[screams] You both look like Carrie.
Don't be silly, Miss Alvarez.
I don't have telekinetic powers no matter how hard I try.
The rain ruined the fun run.
And all those hypocrites bailed, so Syd and I finished the whole thing, just to prove a point.
Yeah, you really showed them.
You look ridiculous.
Hmm.
Look who's talking, Chia Pet.
[gasps] And your hair is flat.
[gasps] You know what's crazy? We ran right past Benihana.
See all those people catching shrimp in their mouths and laughing? Yeah, all of those people having fun.
I am so glad we're beyond that.
Oh, hello.
I see there are more than six peoples in our home.
Well, that settles it.
We must have a party.
I will get my box of decorations.
- Leslie, get the box of decorations.
- No, no.
Guys, no! This is LA.
Rain lasts only five minutes.
It's gonna clear up.
[lightning crashes] Ay, fine.
We'll have a fun party.
Story of my life.
Leslie, don't be depressing.
Sorry, it's kind of my default.
Who reads this crap? "32 Questions to Make You Fall Head Over Heels.
" Well, what are they? Ooh.
This looks fun.
Question one.
Schneider.
"What's your favorite childhood memory?" Uh Have you ever seen Forrest Gump? - No.
- Oh.
Well, in that case, let me tell you something Mama always said.
Wow, Mom, you clean up nice.
Oh, thank you.
You're still grounded.
But I'll admit it's nice to have an excuse to dress up.
Come on.
If you want to get out of the apartment, help me find the champagne flutes in the garage because we are having a party! You're having a party? We are having a party.
[vocalizes mambo music] Nah, man, we ain't having no party.
Okay.
I was just going to leave these at your door No.
Listen, don't be mad.
I, reallyI was supposed to be alone having a romantic time with myself.
Let me start that over.
Uh, the rain ruined everything, and everybody came back, and we're Cuban, so now we're having a party.
Well, I'm Colombian, so I actually get that.
Except with my mom, it's not [vocalizes mambo music] It's [vocalizes Colombian music] Do I hear a Colombian? Thank you for my flowers.
You should stay.
- But my socks are wet.
- You can take them off.
Barefoot on a cold floor? My TÃ­o Paco died that way.
They said it was the cancer, but we all knew.
Mami, you're gonna love him.
Hey, Sam's dad.
What's the news from the outside? Do they still have the Internet? Still grounded, huh? I'd kill for a cat video right now.
Why don't you invite Sam over? Maybe being around someone his own age will take the edge off.
Oh, I would but he's spending the night at his mother's.
Maybe next time.
We didn't have a dime to our name but I needed those leg braces.
So Mama marched up those stairs and did what she had to.
This was years before I met the president.
Wow, that is just Can you believe this guy? I really can't.
Hey, I'm so sorry that our plans turned into this.
But we can still do something socially aware.
Like, did they ever free Tibet? We should check on that.
Or we could just keep hanging out at the party.
I'm kind of curious to find out what happened to Schneider's friend, Bubba.
There's pineapple shrimp, coconut shrimp [Leslie sighs] Leslie, your breathing is so sad.
Stop breathing.
I'm sorry.
This day gets in my head.
My wife left me on Valentine's Day.
[gasps] Pobrecito.
And the divorce papers arrived on April Fool's.
You can imagine the confusion.
Wow! I was sad about my life until just now.
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, Leslie, you cannot go through life like there's a cloud over your head.
[Lydia gasping] I am a bruja.
I knew it.
- Mom, there's a leak! - What? All right.
Don't worry, everybody.
The super will fix it.
Schneider, fix it! I'm on it! Let me just go get my tool belt.
Ooh.
Is it in your apartment? No.
It's next to the trash-can fire I use to keep warm.
Let's finish the questions.
I thought of a lot more dream vacation spots.
Reno, the biggest little city in the world.
Can we please not? I'm so tired of looking at happy girls in tampon ads.
PMS is a thing and it's okay to feel it.
Fine, let's just do what you want to do, again.
Hold on.
What do you mean by that? You think everything I want to do is stupid or a joke.
When did I say that? Only the three times I said I wanted to go to Benihana.
I thought that was a stupid joke! Oh.
I've been dropping hints left and right.
Maybe you should pay a little less attention to the world and a little more attention to me.
Or maybe you should be a little less passive-aggressive and just tell me what you want! Fine! I want to leave! But I can't because my dad isn't picking me up for two hours.
So instead, I want to find out what color makes my eyes pop.
[grunts] Great news, I made an important discovery.
You guys don't live on the top floor.
So this can't be rainwater.
Oh.
It got in my mouth.
So, where is this water coming from? That's as far as I got.
Well, let's ask the water where it's coming from.
Um, it's warm, and it smells like bergamot and hibiscus.
[sniffs] Ooh.
That's nice.
It is your stupid hot tub! It's leaking.
Wait.
You have a hot tub? No.
That would be crazy for a simple boy from Alabama Okay, I'm rich! Like, really rich.
I own this building.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I just thought you'd think less of me if you knew I had a lot of money.
[sighs] I don't I don't think less of you.
What's happening? Is that a Dries Van Noten blouse? Yes.
I'm rich too.
But it's family money.
I didn't make it on purpose.
No, no, no.
Â I know that pain.
You spend and you spend and you spend, and there's always more.
Oh, this is some bull.
Look, II do have a tiny house.
I just keep it in the ballroom of my giant house.
I just wanted you to like me.
I just wanted you to like me.
Leak! Right.
Right.
Let's go fix my hot tub.
Or better yet, let's pay someone else to do it.
Oh! Que romÃ¡ntico! Whoo! Is it always like this over here? Come dance with me.
[dance music plays] Hey.
I just want to tell you that I'm really glad you came over tonight.
Me too.
I feel very much at home here.
My mom's crucifixes are a lot bloodier, but same All-Star team of Popes.
It's pretty great.
[cellphone rings] - Sorry.
- It's okay.
My son.
Everything okay? First, unload the dishwasher, then PlayStation.
All right.
I'll see you when I get home.
I thought you said Sam was with his mom.
What? Oh.
Right.
You lied to me? Why don't want Sam to come over? Does he not know we're dating? Are you embarrassed of me? It's not you.
It's Elena, isn't it? I know she's a lot.
No, Elena is great.
Alex? What's wrong with Alex? Sam's only 15.
I just want to keep him awayÂ from certain things for as long as possible.
This is about the weed thing? Alexmade a mistake like every teenager who's ever lived.
He's a good kid.
And if you haven't noticed, he's being punished by a really on-it mom.
Look, I'm not gonna apologize for being overprotective, or as we Colombians call it, "Colombian.
" Oh, please.
Cubans invented it.
- You know what Colombians are known for? - Don't you say it! We also have coffee and Shakira.
Look I did what I thought was right.
I didn't even let him go on sleepovers till he was 14.
Fourteen? You let a baby sleep over at a stranger's house? You call that overprotective? We didn't even have furniture with corners on it until Alex was 12.
My son's never been in a public pool! I make my kids wear flip-flops in our own shower 'cause I don't know where we've been.
We are both very overprotective people! I guess so! - It's nice to be with someone who gets it.
- Right? I mean, it's not like we're crazy.
No, everybody else is crazy for not being like us.
I can see what a great kid Alex is.
And when his grounding is up, I'd like to have him come over and hang with Sam.
Have you tested your paint for lead? Of course.
I tested your paint for lead.
That is so hot.
Hey.
Hey.
- Are you going to break up with me? - What? No, I'm here to tell you that green makes my eyes pop.
I could have told you that.
I'm really sorry that I didn't take your ideas seriously.
And I'm sorry I wasn't more direct about what I wanted.
Mmm.
Our first fight.
[chuckles] It was a real knock-down, drag-out emotional brawl.
How do you make sure we never have one of those again? Just take me to Benihana.
How can I be clearer? Look.
I love that you're woker than a barnyard rooster.
Butsometimes you just want to hang out with your best gal at a restaurant that's not just a meal.
It's an experience.
I made you something.
Ibailed on giving it to you 'cause I thought it was kind of corny, but Get it? It's binary code, zeros and ones, except for the heart, which is all the other numbers.
So it's a A non-binary heart! Oh, my God.
I love you.
I meanI hope that's okay.
But I do.
Of course it's okay.
I love you too.
Sorry, we're such a clichÃ© saying I love you for the first time on Valentine's Day.
I'm too happy to care.
This is the best thing anyone's ever gotten me.
That is until we go I get it! I'll take you to Benihana.
The leak stopped.
[gasps] Thank you, Schneider! Whoo! Ha-ha! Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Thought we'd come back to the party instead of heading to some fancy restaurant.
We're not too elite to hang with the real peeps.
Late reservation? 10:30 was the earliest we could get.
It's nice to have so many happy couples under one roof.
Yeah.
I'm your classic ninth wheel.
[babbles] Just for the record, Abuelita and I are not together.
Leslie.
I want to tell you something.
Valentine's Day was Berto's day to shine.
Every detail was perfect.
Every piece of chocolate, every petal on every flowerÂ impecable.
Butafter Berto, I knew that there was no way that I would ever have a date with someone else on Valentine's Day.
Because it would dishonor his memory.
I understand.
But [inhales] I figured if I spent the day with my grandson, and we had a chaperone that would be okay.
Yeah? We should share a kiss.
I'm going to eat this even though I'm highly allergic.
This isn't how I saw Valentine's Day going.
[chuckles] But I'm glad it happened.
Salud.
Salud.
The rain has stopped, things are finally starting to look up.
[Penelope screams] I don't know how but I'm sure this is my fault.
I thought you said you fixed the hot tub! I did! Oh, my Japanese toilet! [automated voice] Arigato.
Run, Schneider, run! [theme music plays]
Dang, son! I'm killing this budget spreadsheet.
Being an adult is sad.
I get that.
I have returned.
Dang.
What happened to your nose? I went shoe-shopping with your mother.
Yeah, that tracks.
I'm just lucky Lydia came prepared.
I told you I still need tampons.
Abuelita, you got the shoes! You're my hero.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I really had to fight for them.
Mami, we talked about this.
- You cannot keep spoiling Alex.
- I'm not.
I just went to pick them up for him because he is still grounded.
No, no.
He paid with his own $300.
Three hundred dollars for one pair of shoes? They better come with $280 stuffed in them! Mom, I did exactly what you told me to do.
You said that if I wanted to buy expensive shoes, I had to earn my own money.
I did say that.
Lesson number two.
Don't buy stupid stuff.
Come here.
Look at my credit card statement.
Every dollar is budgeted.
Four hundred dollars a month for groceries, sixty dollars to keep the lights on, seven dollars at the Fountain Hotel.
What? That's not my charge.
Somebody must've stolen my credit card number.
For seven dollars? Not how I would have played it.
No, no, no.
This is what they do.
They start by racking up little charges to make sure the card works.
Macy's, Nike, Harley-Davidson.
Then you realize they're living your best life.
Did you cancel the card? No, I wanted to see what I would have done next.
Listen, I have never even been to your hotel.
It's a minibar charge? You really got the wrong girl.
What are you gonna accuse me of next? Not washing and reusing tinfoil? What was the name on the credit card? Elena Alvarez? Wait! [Penelope] Thank you.
Hi! Why did you use your emergency credit card at the Fountain Hotel? And what were you even doing there? A few people had died there.
I was ghost hunting.
- No, you weren't.
- No, I wasn't.
Elena, come on.
Be honest.
[clears throat] Syd and I got a hotel room.
Why would you need Uh I can't believe you used the minibar.
And you know, you We're going to circle back around to all of this.
Mami, where are you going? I'm not quite sure.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - It's so nice to see you.
- Uh-huh.
What's wrong with Elena? What? Nothing.
I just wanted to hang outside of group.
It's been a while since The last time you wanted to know lesbian stuff about Elena.
That's the only reason you call.
Come on, girl.
That's not true.
It's fine.
What do you want to talk about? What's up with the bees? Are they coming back or what? [chuckles] Just ask me a question about Elena.
It's fine.
I kind of like being your lesbian Yoda.
I think she's having sex.
[in a robotic voice] I will need another drink.
I don't know Yoda.
[Schneider clears throat] So your mom has asked me to give you a little chat about irresponsible spending.
Yeah.
She said to show me all the stupid stuff you wasted money on so that I don't end up like you.
It's a program she calls "Scared Smart".
Yeah, she's really starting to lean on me as a co-parent.
[Schneider] Take a gander.
Really old comic books, unopened Star Wars toys, Shirley Temple's tap shoes.
Why did I think they'd fit? Who would want all this crap? Schneider, all this stuff is really cool.
Is it? Or is it just a symbol of a young man who tried to use money to fill the hole in his soul? It didn't work.
Yeah, but now all of this stuff is worth tons of money.
Is it? Wait.
Is it? You own the Ghostbusters car? Yes, I do.
Here's a lesson: I heard that car was suddenly going up for auction, so I had to ditch dinner plans with my favorite Uncle Gary.
He'd just had a triple bypass.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
He died while I was at that auction.
Turns out, he needed a quadruple bypass.
I will always regret that day.
'Cause you were so selfish, you forgot family is more important than anything.
No.
'Cause I should have waited and bid on the Back to the Future car.
That thing travels back in time.
I could've gone back and not bid on the Ghostbusters car.
Or told Gary to have that fourth bypass, but whatever, your thing works, too.
See, I know what I would say to Elena if she were straight.
Use a condom.
Take the pill.
Don't have sex.
Well, when you're a lesbian, it's even simpler.
You don't need a condom, you don't need the pill, and the best part, four boobs.
Okay.
I get it.
It's great.
But what about STDs? Safe lesbian sex is not my area of expertise.
I mean, what do you use? A dish glove? A swim cap? A thimble? Do you even have a vagina? There's hardly any risk physically.
She's gonna be fine.
So what? I'm supposed to be okay that she's having sex? I'm a mom.
She's my kid.
I can't condone this.
No, Ramona.
When did I become the bad guy? I'm just trying to make you less worried, and I can assume it's with Syd, who she's been dating forever? [exhales deeply] Elena's 17.
She is just way too young.
And how old were you? Seventeen and a half.
And what did your mom say? [scoffs] Are you kidding me? She doesn't know.
I was sneaky.
I didn't put her through the torture of thinking about this.
As far as she knows, I had sex once to make Elena.
And how does she think Alex got here? She tells people she had him.
If you're gonna be a sexually active teenager, you need to do it responsibly and make sure your parents never find out.
But now I know, and I have to have an opinion.
And I don't want to be the mom that's all, "Sex is dirty.
You're gonna go to hell.
" But I also don't want to be the mom that's like, "Use my bed.
I'll get you water, so you stay hydrated.
" Now I have to talk to her.
[cries] I don't want to.
Oh, Papito, how are the shoes? Great.
I sold them.
[dish clangs] I know, I know, but they were already worth twice as much as what I paid for them.
How could you do such a thing? I stood in line for hours! I know, and Dr.
Berkowitz got a busted nose.
Oh, please.
That's just a scratch.
Abuelita, I really appreciate what you did.
Mm-hmm.
So I'm going to use some money to take you out to dinner.
Aww, Papito.
You do a lot for me, and it's time I paid you back a little.
And unlike Mami, I'm gonna let you get an appetizer and a beverage.
[laughs] I know that's how they get you.
But they're gonna get us.
You are such a good sonGrandson.
Listen, Mami Okay, look, you know why I'm here.
We got to do this.
I don't want to do it either, but here goes.
I'm your mom.
My first instinct is to protect you.
I mean, if I had it my way, I'd keep you hidden away from the world in my mouth like a freaking pelican.
Actually, Finding Nemo is really misleading.
Pelicans Okay, I'm halfway through a very prepared speech.
Even though I sometimes wish it weren't happening, you're growing up.
The first time I had sex, I was 17.
I thought I was ready, but I kind of had a freak out after.
It's a roller coaster.
One day, you're fine.
Next day, you have sex.
The day after that, the boy you lost your virginity to doesn't call you back, and you're filling the glove compartment of his Camaro with tuna so he knows he messed with the wrong girl.
Then you're called "Tunelope" for the rest of high school.
Worth it? Yes.
Okay, you lost me.
[sighs] What I mean is that it's very emotional.
And also, check your answering machine 'cause maybe he called you while you were loading up on Dollar Store tuna.
The point I'm trying to make is that sex is not a dirty thing that you should hide.
But it's also not something that you should take lightly.
And I just want to make sure that you're okay with what did or didn't happen.
So, are you okay? Well Hey, guys.
Mom, that was a really gendered greeting.
Don't try to distract me from the fact that this door was closed when you know it should be open.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm sorry too about the gendered greeting.
Later, dudes.
Oh, caught that one.
Can we go to your house? I'm homeschooled, and my parents are holding football tryouts for my brother.
We never get to be alone.
And I love just making out with you, but - Yeah.
- Yeah? Because I think I'm ready for more if you're ready.
I'm definitely ready to do more than fumble with your bra whenever your mom isn't checking on us.
Which is only when she's in the bathroom.
Remember when she got food poisoning? That was so hot.
Okay, so what do we do? Where can we be alone? What do they do in teen movies? I feel like a lot of stuff happens in parked cars.
Damn.
I need to learn how to drive so we can park.
[Alex clears throat] Alex, what're you doing? Mom's in the bathroom, so she's making me stand here.
Can I ask a favor since I spend the afternoon chaperoning two horny nerds? Sure, honey, anything.
Can I have tomorrow off from being grounded? Aww.
No.
You screwed up, and now you are my prisoner.
Psst! Papito.
Do you, uh, need something from the outside? The new Yeezys drop tomorrow.
Jesus is coming back tomorrow? I just spoke to him.
He didn't tell me anything.
Yeezys are sneakers.
I've been saving up for months now, and if I'm not in line at the store tomorrow, they'll all be gone.
Consider it done.
I will get you those shoes even if I have to cut off somebody's feet.
You just have to stand in line.
Oh, fine.
Suck the fun out of it.
Which reminds me.
I will invite Leslie.
Really? Okay.
Thanks.
Now, let me tell you which sneakers to get.
No need.
I will just get the ones that go best with your church pants.
What? No.
Okay.
Then I'll get whatever's on sale.
That's worse.
Abuelita, we need to find a way for you to get me exactly what I want.
Is it working? Can you see what the phone is pointing at? Yes! Now please turn it around.
[Elena clears throat] Hey there.
We would like to rent a room.
You know, like we've done a million times.
Ugh, so sick of it.
That's the life we chose as traveling astronauts.
Thatis the name of our band.
Good save.
I'll just need a credit card.
Well, uh, sir, we were hoping that we could pay for this room in cash.
Cash from all our music gigs.
Not playing for money in a competitive Magic: The Gathering League.
We still need a credit card on file for incidentals.
- Do you have a credit card? - No.
- Do you have one? - Kind of.
My mom gave me one, but it's supposed to be for emergencies only.
I mean, it is kind of an emergency.
[giggles] Yeah, she's not gonna see it that way.
Not that I was totally listening, but heads-up on that credit card.
It's just a precaution.
It won't be charged.
Are you sure? Yeah.
Just don't touch the minibar or steal a robe.
[Elena chuckles] And no trash in the room, rockstars.
Aww! That sucks, square.
Sorry.
Ugh! Musicians.
Oh! It's our turn finally.
Nice.
Remember, just repeat after me.
Hi.
How can I help you? Hey, bro, how are you living? Hook me up with what is good.
What do you want? - Okay, I want - Alex, what are you doing? Nothing? I want nothing.
All right.
Next.
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.
You're grounded, which, you know, means you're not supposed to be on your phone on the weekends.
Hello.
Hello, Alex? Hello? Oh, no.
Papito has been compromised.
Okay.
We are on our own.
We want the Jesus shoes.
- Yeezys.
- Yeah.
These are the two pairs that just dropped.
Thank you for picking them up.
How do we know which ones he wants? Well, the yellow ones are pretty sharp.
Right.
We'll take the blue one, size eight.
That guy just bought the last four pairs.
[sighs] Hola.
I speak Spanish because I grew up in Cuba.
As a child, I had to flee.
I escape with absolutely You're not getting my shoes.
No, wait.
Listen.
I am going to tell you something I have never told anybody before.
You would probably not believe it.
I am old.
Oh, Lydia, your soul isn't a day over 25.
Can it, Leslie! Look, I have $300.
Oh, please.
This is for my grandson.
He is the most important person in the world to me.
You know, I know I might not be around forever, but these shoes will be.
Maybe it's silly to you, but I just want him to have something to always remember me by.
Wow, I get that.
I guess he can remember you as the grandmother who didn't get him these bitching kicks.
[chatter in disagreement] You have four pairs.
Give her the shoes.
Yeah, give her the shoes, man! This is going viral.
Don't be that guy.
You know how long she must have had to save up for those? Yeah, man, don't be a racist.
Give the maid the shoes.
[chatter] [girl] Come on! - Fine! - You got plenty of them.
[Lydia gasps] Thank you.
Thank you.
[Lydia laughs] Lydia, you did it! Pa'lante! [Leslie groans] [laughs] Andlet's begin.
That was weird.
Yep.
I just feel like, in the movies, they usually skip to like the end of this.
Right? Boom! One of us has the sheet here, the other has it down here.
[Elena chuckles] Oh, wait.
I wanted to set the mood, so I made a playlist of the sexiest songs.
["The X-Files" theme plays] X-Files.
Wait.
[music stops] So, I just want you to know how incredible I think you are.
I am so happy that you're the first person I'm doing this with.
And I think that you are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life, and I can't believe your heart is even more beautiful.
Oh! We already paid for the room.
You're gonna get some.
All right.
We talked the talk, now we got to walk the walk.
Do you consent to engage in sexual activity with me? An enthusiastic "yes"! - Do you? - Oh, hell yes! As agreed, our safe word is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Hey, did you bring a condom? Uh, yeah.
I've had one in my wallet since, like, eighth grade.
[Elena laughs] When was the last time you got tested? Last year when I was with Selene.
Wait, are you serious? You've had sex before.
Yeah.
Wow.
I'm sorry.
I didn't tell you because I didn't even want to talk to you about it until I was sure you were ready.
I didn't want to put any pressure on it.
I just thought this was gonna be both of our first times.
Well I wasn't in love then, but I am now.
So in a way, this is my first time, too.
I also wanted you to think that I was awesome at it right out the gate.
But mostly, I wanted to make sure this happened on your terms.
This is a big deal.
Mm-hmm.
It is a big deal! What if I think I'm ready and I'm not really ready? How am I going to know because five minutes ago, I was all like, "Yeah, let's do this," and now we're in a random hotel room about to do it.
How did I not think about any of this before? Are you okay? You're gonna see me naked.
Like, full naked.
You think this is white.
This has never seen the sun.
But then again, virginity is just a construct used to uphold the patriarchy, and I can't even get pregnant.
So who cares? Okay, but now that I really think about it I don't know.
I'm scared.
What if this changes everything, and not in a good way? Elena, there's no rush.
We can do it next month, next year.
We can never do it if that's what you want.
No matter what happens, I love you.
I love you, too.
Let's just watch a movie.
There's a Harry Potter marathon on, and I brought Every Flavour Beans in case this happened.
Did you hear something fall? - No.
- Okay.
So, are you okay? Well yeah.
I am.
Good.
Are you okay? Well I was really wishing you were better at sneaking around like I was, so I wouldn't have to know anything about this.
But now that I do, I am glad that we're talking like this.
And I'm glad you had a good experience.
And that it happened with someone you love.
But I'm still your mom, and the rules of this house stay the same.
That door stays open.
Okay, Mami.
- Do you want to know the best part? - No.
I took all the toiletries.
[Penelope exhales] [sniffles] You really are a woman now.
Abuelita.
[Lydia] In here, Papito.
I would have rather walked in on you two doing it.
Ay, cochino! You know, I have it on my bucket list to paint a masterpiece.
Oh, I can't wait to see how I look! Okay.
Wow.
You've really captured my essence.
[door opens] Oh, my God! You're so frustrating.
- I'm teaching you to drive.
- No! You're watching me parallel park and screaming, "We're all gonna die!" That's teaching you to drive.
You don't even make sense half of the time.
You told me to hurry up and slow down.
Which one is it? It's both.
That's why you're not ready.
Ooh, you really captured his essence.
Anyway, I ain't got no money for driving school.
So you're stuck with me, unless you can find a sucker with nothing better to do than get behind the wheel with you.
[snaps] I'll do it.
- Really? - Yes, I'd love to, and I have a spotless driving record.
[Lydia] It is true.
Leslie drives like an old lady.
I mean, I assume.
I don't know what old ladies do.
Wow, Dr.
B, this would really help me out.
And my boards are coming up, and this is really stressing me out.
Elena, this is going to be such fun.
My father taught me using his patented 30-point system.
Thirty points? Agreed.
Inadequate.
So I have updated it to the 42-point system.
I figure two hours per point, you'll be driving by Passover.
Sowe're gonna be in a car together for 84 hours.
Oh, please.
We don't even get into the car until hour 12.
- [theme song plays] - This isÂ it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time It's cool that juggling is on your bucket list.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
I have done it.
Check.
- Mami.
- [Lydia] Okay, Lupe.
Now we go to the kitchen.
Come join me.
It's time to finally teach you all of my family recipes.
Mami, that sounds really nice, and I would love to right after my board exams.
I completely understand, but hear me out.
You have no choice.
It's on my bucket list.
You know that's not a legally binding document, right? So now you're going to law school, too? Come on.
You have so much time now that Leslie is teaching Elena how to drive.
Mami, I don't even have time to tell you that I don't have time.
Lupita, I have two great legacies: my family recipes and a neckline that almost capsized a Carnival Cruise.
Mami, just write the recipes down, then we can have them forever.
I cannot do that.
My sister, Mirtha, will break in, she will steal the recipes, she will rappel out the window, and ticky-tocky, she will be on the Food Network winning the Chopped.
Mami, you know I love you, but I cannot do this right now.
I promise you, one day we will, and we will have a great time together.
Okay? Okay.
I'm sure I will live forever.
I will simply write a new list.
A list of [sniffs] [crying] disappointments.
Okay.
Seat belts are buckled.
You've adjusted the mirrors.
Now, I want you to peek at yourself in the rearview and say, "Hot cakes! Am I a winner?" I'm not doing that.
Skipping step 19.
So, I just wanted to thank you again for teaching me how to drive.
You must be so busy.
Oh, I have lots of time.
I've already watched Netflix.
- What show? - No, all of Netflix.
I'm just glad to be doing this with anybody but my mom.
She's always yelling and criticizing my every move.
- Well, no yelling here.
- [sighs deeply] Now, shift and carefully pull out.
[car crashes] See, right now, my mom would definitely be yelling at me.
Mami, I'll see you later.
I'm on my way to therapy.
Okay, sweetie, but make sure to call if you'll be late for dinner.
It's like I don't want to know, but also I do.
Hey, your mom wanted to pass down her family recipes to someone worthy.
So she's teaching me everything.
Yeah, this is on me for walking in.
Mmm! Ay, Schneider.
It is like you are the true heir of my spirit.
[laughs] Dale, Schneidito Dale Whoo! Whoo! Dale, Schneidito Dale - Okay, I get it.
- Get what? There is nothing to get.
Other than a bowl of Schneider's sopa de pollo, which he will be ableÂ to pass down to his daughter's handyman.
Is the ropa vieja ready yet? - You taught him ropa vieja? - Yeah.
That recipe is so secret that you buy each ingredient in a different store so the cashiers can't reconstruct the recipe.
It's not the cashiers.
It's the bag boys.
"Please let us help you to your car.
" I know what you're up to, comunistas.
All right, papito.
Abre tu boca.
Provocative flavor profile.
Good ratio of ropa to vieja.
Welcome to the family.
[laughs] Ah, good job, mijo.
[laughing] Oh, my God.
Mami, you are being so ridiculous.
- Huh? - I say no to you once, and you adopt a 40-year-old five-year-old? Don't talk to Mami like that! Okay.
Bye, crazy people.
[sighs] Sometimes I can't believe we're related.
All right.
No damage to the car, got me a fresh pair of pants.
Bingo-bango, we're back on the road.
I am so sorry, Dr.
B.
That mailbox came out of nowhere.
I think the problem is you're driving your mirrors.
It means you're spending more time worrying about what's behind you - and not enough on what's ahead.
- [sighs] I justI get so overwhelmed.
Elena, I get it.
Driving's hard.
Got a million people coming at you.
And, yeah, you could die at any moment.
Or worse.
You could fall into a coma, be trapped in your own mind forever.
New approach.
Are you a Battlestar Galactica fan? The original or the reboot? I don't know why I asked.
I love them both.
And I assume you like the character Starbuck? [giggles] Starbuck.
Do you remember when she hijacked the Cylon spacecraft, but she couldn't figure out how to fly it? Season one, episode five.
She just focused on power, pitch, yaw and roll, and flew that baby home.
So, for you, it is accelerate, brake, steer, avoid mailboxes.
That actually helps.
Accelerate, brake, steer [tires squeal] avoid mailbox.
[chuckles] Look.
I'm frakking flying this bad boy.
Can you believe my mom? I told her I'm too busy to cook, and she replaces me with Schneider.
Wait, so you're mad she turned your hot handyman into a hot chef? When are you gonna hook me up with him? Well, we all know mother-daughter relationships can be real triggers for stress.
- Thank you, Pam.
- Yep.
Whether it's cooking with you or keeping a secret family in Alhambra.
I mean, these relationships can be tricky.
She has no sympathy for how busy I am.
She could just write the recipes down, but no.
She's too afraid her 60-year-old sister will freaking Mission: Impossible into the apartment and steal them.
That's nuts.
If she'd have write them down, where'd she keep 'em? Sorry.
I'd take her paella over sex with Schneider.
Although both could be involved.
Your mother is incredible, Penelope.
When I had my baby, she's the only oneÂ who could get her to stop crying.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, she dipped her pacifier in rum, butpff, it worked, so Uh, you guys don't spend enough time with her.
- I'd love to spend more time with her.
- Me too.
Do you think she'd like to meet my new sister? She's a lot, okay? She's constantly criticizing everything about me.
She's the most stubborn person I know.
You're telling me the woman who when your daughter came out overcame all her religious objections and accepted her in one second.
She needs to accept the fact that I don't have six hours to make ropa vieja.
I have a lot on my plate.
'Cause your mother's always cooking for you? Oh! [all laughing] My mom cookedmeth.
My mom is a pain in the nalgas.
That is the train we should all be riding here, people.
I thought this was a support group.
So why don't we knock it off, and why don't we start supporting? Okay? Yeah, I got nothing.
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'Cause you asked for it 'Cause you need oneÂ  You see Sara Bareilles, Janelle Monet, Indigo Girls.
You know you didn't have to make a special lesbian playlist for me.
- I didn't.
Sapphic folk is my jam.
- [both chuckle] I'm not gonna write you to stay Ay, ay If all you have is leavingÂ  I will need a better reason To write you A love song todayÂ  [phone dings] [automated voice] Incoming text message.
Oh, sorry.
I get my texts through Bluetooth.
[automated voice] Message from Rachel.
Oh, it's my daughter.
[automated voice] Hey, Leslie, I need money.
Call me when you send it.
Neutral faceÂ emoji.
I'm jazzed at how upbeat she sounds.
Really? Oh, this is huge.
She wants me to call her.
[automated voice] Actually, don't call.
Just send money.
I loveVenmo.
I'm sorry she only hits you up for money.
No, it's okay, Elena.
Truth is I blame myself.
Between med school, and residency, and hospital rotations, I wasn't around much when she was a kid.
And I would love it if we could just get to the point where Rachel would ask me how I was doing before she asked me for money, but there's too much water under the bridge.
[automated voice] Just checked my account.
Still no money.
So sick of this.
Poop emoji.
Okay.
Let's just keep rocking out.
Write you a love song Come on, Dr.
B.
[singing sadly] 'Cause you asked for one 'Cause you need one You see I'm not gonna write you a love songÂ  'Cause you're telling meÂ  Hey, now that I'm officially a member of la familia, maybe I could add something to the Alvarez Family Museum.
Oh, it's very exclusive.
It has to be a report card, or a trophy, or any tooth from Alex's mouth.
My eight-year sobriety chip.
[sighs deeply[ It would be my honor.
Oh.
[laughs] Ironically, the only other Wall of Fame I've been on was my favorite bar, Tom Bergin's, for inventing something called the tequila bong.
- What is that? - I do not remember.
AnywayI thought staying sober these last eight years was my greatest accomplishment until today when I became an official member of this family.
Schneider.
Okay, viejita, you win.
I would love to learn your recipes.
Get out of my house.
Blinker on.
Check in the mirror.
All clear.
Quick glance, over my shoulder, and pulling safely in.
Hot cakes! Am I a winner? Now, step 37.
Always be aware of your Where the hell are we? Wehave arrived at your final destination.
Rachel's house.
Wow.
I paid for it, but I've never seen it before.
How did you know where to go? Well, when we stopped for gas, I looked through your contacts.
Oh, and your daily smile reminder went off.
Oh, thanks.
So I was thinking about your relationship with Rachel, and I realize that you are also driving your mirrors.
You need to stop dwelling on the past and start focusing on what's ahead.
You want to be a good dad now.
So do it.
[sighs deeply] I don't know.
I don't think she wants to see me.
Look I have some experience with father-daughter baggage.
And even when things were at their absolute worst, I still just wanted a hug.
To hear him say he loved me.
I bet Rachel's no different.
Okay, I'll do it.
And, uhthanks, Elena because I never would have come here on my own.
[phone dings] [automated voice] Incoming text message.
Leslie, is that you in front of my house? Vomit emoji.
I better get in there.
Oh, watch out for that dog! - [dog barks] - Oh! Justjust forget the shoe! Just keep going.
[barking continues] [upbeat music playing] Whoo! All right! Mami, I think my arroz con pollo is almost ready.
- Uh-huh.
- And I gotta admit I'm a little nervous about having you taste it, which says something considering I was, you know, in a war.
[both laugh] Okay.
Let's take a look.
- Oh! - Uh-huh? No? - Just kidding.
- [laughs, exclaims] - You really mean it? - Fabuloso! [squeals] Oh, God! Like, I gotta tell you, it's really cool that you taught me this recipe.
- So thank you.
- Yeah.
Bravissima, Lupita! With pollo that good, no man will dare to leave you again.
Excuse me.
What did you just say? I said, "Bravissima!" It means "job well done" in Italian.
Mami, did you want to teach me to cook because you think it'll help me get a man? Because I got one, Mateo, and he's great.
Of course he is.
You never had trouble finding wonderful men.
This is so you can keep them.
Hey! I chose to leave Victor and Max.
It wasn't because of my cooking.
But I'm starting to think it might be because of the annoying Cuban lady - who moved into my dining room.
- Oh.
Now, you are getting mad for nothing.
There are always things to work on.
So I am helping you.
That's why this was on the list.
"Fix Penelope.
" [scoffs] Fix me? What the hell does that mean? No, no, no, no, no.
It's just little tweaks.
Como how you always wear your pajamas going out of the house.
I'm a nurse.
They're scrubs! Lupita, you are a beautiful woman.
Why not dress like a sexy nurse? Everyone on Grey's Monotony looks amazing! What else do you think needs fixing? Nothing! Abuelita, the teeth-whitening trays you ordered came.
Listen, Mami, I have accomplished a lot in my life.
When will I ever be enough for you? It is not that you are not enough.
It is that I have not finished my job as a mother.
What're you talking about? I'm 40.
I have a good career.
I have two healthy kids.
You are living in my house.
You're done.
Done? You use a Trader Joe's bag as a purse! That was one time! Mira, when I woke up from that coma, my first thought was[gasps] "I cannot believe I almost left Lupita alone.
" So, no matter what I do, I'm a failure if I'm not married? Gracias a Dios, you finally get it! Oh, my Look I know in your day pleasing a man was a woman's greatest achievement.
You got that right.
I had to be great in the kitchen, better on the dance floor, and do my best work on my knees.
Aye, Mami, gross! Que? I kept that floor very clean.
I had to.
Your father and I made love on it all the time.
You are lucky that you met a guy like Papi.
I haven't yet, but that's not my fault.
But you are constantly telling me that it is, and everything else that you think is wrong with me.
How do you think that makes me feel? You're always comparing me to you because you think you're so perfect.
But a perfect mom doesn't make her kid feel like this.
Bueno.
Okay, Mom, I won't tell you about my driving lesson because I know it stresses you out.
So I'll just say that it went well, and Dr.
Berkowitz took a huge step with his daughter.
She let him give her cash in person.
Emptied his wallet.
I've never seen him so happy.
You're perfect.
[sighs] What? I want you to knowthat you are enough.
Is this some passive-aggressive Mom way of telling me not to gain weight? [laughing] No! No.
I just want you to know that I'm not judging you, and I am in awe of who you've become.
And if, for one second, I ever made you feel like you weren't a freaking perfect piece of work, then I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't know what happened while I was gone, but I like you like this.
Lupita.
I have something for you.
Better not be neck tightening cream.
I just want to say that I'm not sorry.
Wow.
Thanks.
Mira, whatever comes out of my mouth comes out because I love you, and I want you to be happy.
I am not trying to hurt your feelings, pero if you want me to accept you for being you, you have to accept me for being me.
Lupita.
To me you are the most perfect person alive.
There is no one even close to you.
Butthat goes without saying.
[crying] No, Mami, it doesn't go without saying.
You have to say it.
Okay.
Okay.
You are enough.
You are more than enough.
- Okay.
- Okay? Ay, I said too much.
[chuckles] Anyways, herethe recipes.
The Bible? I mean, I know your recipes have been around a long time Well, I keep them in the Bible because Mirtha cannot touch them without burning her hands.
[chuckles] [sighs deeply] Huh? - It's amazing.
- Uh-huh.
Wait.
These measurements don't make sense.
"A whisper of paprika"? "Enough butter to make a man fall off a horse"? Oh, yes, it is written in code.
[laughs] The key will be delivered upon my death.
I hope I never see that key.
Oh.
[sighs] Given the way you take care of yourself, I may outlive you.
 Oh, thanks, Nurse Alvarez.
But are you sure it's not appendicitis? I searched WebMD, and they said it could be all sorts of things, even cancer.
Oh, god! Do you think I have cancer? It's not cancer, but your family is still gonna be be very upset.
It's gas.
Are you sure? You had Cajun food at 3:00 a.
m.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Just take some antacid.
You'll be fine.
[chuckles softly] Hey, Doc,Â maybe I'm just second-guessing myself, - but can I get a consult? - [Leslie] Sure.
Mrs.
Homer came in with some stomach pain.
She had intestinal discomfort? Yeah, but she also ate two pounds of blackened catfish.
Penelope, have you learned anything at all studying for your board exams? A nurse practitioner should know that appendicitis classically presents as lower right quadrant pain.
If her appendix ruptures, she could die.
Or worse, sue me! I would be penniless.
I would lose my penny collection, and it's all your fault.
[Mrs.
Homer groans] I don't feel so good.
On second thought, We should check your appendix to make sure it doesn't - [splats] - [screams]rupture.
[breathes heavily] [exhales] So, I had an anxiety attack.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time So just to be clear, nobody exploded for real, right? No.
Oh, man! She did drop a monster belch in the hallway.
Nice.
She never even came back in, but at thatÂ moment, I started to spiral, and my brainÂ went to the worst-case scenario.
My worst-case scenario is the world ending, and I have to eat my mother.
Ew.
And the whole time, all she's talking about is, "You are still too skinny.
" So you get it.
Once my brain goes there, I can barely breathe.
So, everybody here is familiar with anxiety attacks, right? I don't get those.
You never spiral into intense feelings of fear accompanied by palpitations and troubled breathing? Oh, yeah, I get those all the time.
After mine, I'm just drenched in sweat.
So to cover, I say, "I just got some.
Up top!" [laughs] Well, I always freak out during fireworks.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Makes me feel like I'm right back in combat.
I know, right? The other day, a kid threw a snap at me.
Before I knew it, I had him in a headlock.
Now, the judge says I gotta clean some parks.
I just put my back against the wall and try to remind myself that I am safe in my apartment.
And then I remember how much I pay for a one bedroom in Koreatown.
Then the cycle just starts all over again.
Grounding yourself is so important.
Sit somewhere you feel safe.
Focus on your breath and think about what's real.
All great coping mechanisms.
Is somethingÂ triggering you? That's just it.
No.
I mean, I have these life-changing tests coming up, but I have that under control because I have to.
I've been working on itÂ for two years now, and it's all getting real real.
Plus, I have a sexually-active teenage daughter, a fragile, elderly mother, and a son doing drugs.
[breathes shakily] But I think I'm handling it well.
Aw, honey, you're a mess.
[laughs] Okay, maybe it is all getting to me, but I haveÂ found some coping mechanisms that work.
Alex, did you do your homework? This is my homework.
I'm in high school.
[gasps] I'm majoring in doobies with a minor in Doritos.
Ooh! I can turn this into a bong.
Okay.
[exhales] Relax.
[breathes heavily] What's real? What's really happening? I'm literally about to do my homework.
You don't have to remind me.
[hyperventilates] Are you okay? Why are you breathing so heavy? The ghost of your abuelito just passed through me.
That makes sense.
Abuelita comes out of her curtain all sweaty and says that too.
No one says "doobie" anymore, stupid.
You're the same age as me, stupid.
I'm having a really rough time, Pam.
The anxiety attacks are coming on stronger and faster.
Why don't we throw it out to the group and see how everyone copes? I'm partial to red wine and denial.
A Hungry-Man frozen dinner and a hungry man from Tinder.
Okay, none of those are healthy coping mechanisms.
I need something stronger than just grounding.
My go-to is the stop sign.
Like whenÂ I found out that Gina was cheating on me, and I lost it.
I found myself standing over a pile of her clothes, ready to set them on fire.
Well, I hope in that moment, you asked yourself what was real.
I did, and the answer was a can of gas in this hand and a book of matches in the other.
- But then - Ay, thank god! I pictured a big red stop sign, and it made me think, "Do I really want to go all Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes on her stuff?" The answer was still yes, but I didn't.
I am so glad you had a moment of clarity.
Yeah, because I'm too pretty for jail.
[chuckles] I mean, look at this.
I tried the stop sign the other day when this thing happened with Mateo.
Your boyfriend? If you're thinking about checking his phone, that's a sign to check his phone.
No, that's not it, and we're still trying to figure out what we are.
He's getting real comfortable, though.
[sighs] I could just stay like this forever.
I signed us up for joint checking.
It's called a handcuff account.
[Penelope gasps] Oh, thanks.
Hey, babe, you mind grabbing me something from the fridge? Oh, wait.
I can get it myself 'cause I live here now.
Hey, what do you say we go have competent but unspectacular sex? Not all techniques work for all people.
Not all boyfriends work for all people.
Oh, no, he's great.
I mean, he's nice.
You know, he's a really good guy.
That bad, huh? Penelope, it does sound like you don't lean on your romantic partner for emotional support.
Romantic partner? More like "I need someone to watch House Hunters with" partner.
You should all have people you can turn to in moments of emotional distress.
Well, sometimes, I talk myself down.
But when that doesn't work, I turn to And I cannot believe I'm about to admit this.
Schneider.
You bone that dude? No! Look, I know it's hard to believe, but Schneider is oddly calming.
Like white noise.
The whitest of noises.
I know he's a privileged, hipster, clueless man-baby who thinks he's Latino but still pronounces the H in "hola," but he gets me.
We have a system, you know.
When I start to spiral, I text him.
He talks me through it.
Like the other day when I was taking a practice test.
[timer beeps] Pencils down.
I said, "Pencils down," Mom! - I got one more question left.
- No.
How cool is this? You taking your practice NP test.
Me taking my practice SAT test.
Mine's harder.
No, I'm kidding.
Actually, I'm not.
Next stop, Yale! Okay.
[laughs] Yale.
Narrowing it down, huh? Yes, to Yale! [giggles] So many things to think about.
Should I join the Whiffenpoofs? What the hell is a Whiffenpoof? It's an a capella singing group that's all male until I get there.
I'm gonna go check my test scores.
I love tests! Wow! Okay.
[laughs] Ooh, yes! I think I did pretty good too.
There's a whole other page.
[gasps] Oh, my God! It's like, even if I finished every single one of them [breathes heavily] I would still fail.
[hyperventilating] Oh, God! Just Oh, God! God! Okay, just breathe.
Okay, relax.
Just relax.
[exhales deeply] [types] [lute music playing] [phone buzzes] [lute music continues] - [lute music stops] - Come on! [crying softly] [laughs] No.
Oh, right.
She worries too much about their health.
Ah! Who fed this baby so much? [breathes heavily] [sighs] Oh, God! So stupid! Aw! He's so cute.
He looks like a little anchorman from the '70s.
Okay.
[door opens] Hola.
Did you like that pug dressed as Dame Judi Dench? [laughs] Yes.
Thank you, Schneider.
All right, just doing my final check-in.
- Brought the Wet Wipes.
- Okay.
So, you okay now? All right, nowÂ just remember.
All this hard work, everything you're juggling right now, - it's leading to great things.
- [sniffles] Don't quit before the miracle happens.
And hey, I'm always here for you.
[all] Aw! Now I wanna bone him.
Pam, we're all screwed up.
Shouldn't we be cured by now? I never said there was a cure.
So all this is forever? What a scam! [laughs] Listen, you guys have made a lot of progress.
I mean, it's been two years since Ramona set anything on fire.
[all cheer] And remember, anxiety is always rooted in something, and it tends to run in families.
Oh! [laughs] Believe me, I know exactly where I got it from.
- Lupita! - QuÃ©? Remember we went to the park last weekend, and there were so many mosquitoes swarming everywhere? I think they had the Zikas.
And now, we have the Zikas.
Oh, okay, Mami, good night.
No, no! Pero Elena bumped her head on a kitchen cabinet, un tremendo cocotaso.
We should not have let her go to sleep.
If she has a concussion, she will die.
I went to check on her.
Her breathing is relaxed.
Too relaxed.
SueÃ±a con los angelitos.
[sighs] Ay! Now, I gotta go check on Elena's breathing.
Siri, Google Zika symptoms.
Wait, that was at what time? Like, 4:00 a.
m.
What did you find out about the Zikas? I'm going camping.
I wonder if meditation would help yourÂ mom with her anxiety.
It certainly helped you.
Oh, believe me.
I've tried, but she always tells me that I should pray instead.
Hey, prayer works.
I always get a good parking space.
You know, prayer works for her.
And in a way, it works for me too.
[Lydia] Hola, Dios.
It's me.
I know you usually seek my counsel, but Pero today, I need a little favor from you, please.
Give Lupita a little extra help.
You know that Berto and I came to this country in search of freedom and for our children to pursue their dreams.
And Lupita is doing this.
I am so proud of her.
Obviously, I cannot tell her.
Otherwise, she will get lazy.
Pero please, give her all the strength she needs to achieve her dream.
You do this, and we will finally be even.
Amen.
[all] Oh! Aw! I know.
I know.
She's great, except when sheÂ describes me being on antidepressants as[imitates Lydia] the great family shame.
Well, at least you can be a better example for your kids.
Oh, no, they don't know about my great shame.
Hold on.
What? They don't know you have anxiety and depression? No, I don't wanna freak them out like that.
They're babies.
Oh, yeah, what's Elena now? Two hundred and four months? They're so cute when they start driving.
[all laugh] All right.
Ha-ha! Hilarious.
I get it.
But I have the weight of this whole family on my shoulders, and I needÂ them to believeÂ that they're being raised by a stable person.
Wait, Penelope.
Having anxiety and depression does not make you an unstable person, but it can be hereditary.
Elena or Alex could be exhibiting signs, and it often starts around puberty.
Ay, puberty! Between pimples, and the horniness, and suddenly sprouting a mustache, and I can only imagine what Alex is going through.
And if Alex or Elena are exhibiting signs of anxiety or depression, they might not want to open up to you about it.
Okay, you know what? Let's just leave my kids out of this, okay? They need to know you're human.
Do they? Really? 'Cause I'm their mom.
And I don't want them worrying about things they don't need to worry about.
That's my job, right? I don't bring stress.
I take away stress.
And I have a very calming energy, and I make everyone around me very happy, okay? Okay.
[timer buzzes] Pencils down! I was writing a thank-you note.
I'm sorry.
I'm in test mode.
[chuckles] I just really need to step it up if I want to get into Yale.
Can you get early admission, like, now? Hello, everybody.
I really gotta pee.
My therapy session was great.
Everything is great.
She seem a little weird to you? Yeah.
She's probably just worried about how you wanna bankrupt the family by going to Yale.
Don't worry, Papito.
She will never get into Yale.
[Penelope] Yale again? Come on.
You know we can't afford it.
And, frankly, you trying to put the family under that kind of financial stress is really selfish.
And even if you do get in, everyone will know that you don't belong.
You'll never go You'll never goÂ  You'll never ever go hereÂ  You'll never go You'll never goÂ  And they let a girl in last yearÂ  [hyperventilates] Stupid, stupid You're very stupidÂ  You're very, very, very, very stupidÂ  [Alex] Elena, are you okay? Elena? - What's going on? - I don't know.
What's going on? What's happening? Look at me.
Okay, stop.
Breathe.
[breathes deeply] [Penelope] Okay.
You're home, right? You're safe.
Look at me.
Just breathe.
[breathes deeply] [Penelope] You're okay, all right? Look at this.
Look.
Who fed that baby so much? Oh, I'm sorry.
- Look, a dog with a wig.
- [both chuckle] Oh! [sighs heavily] You okay? Yeah, that was weird.
I'm sorry.
I just get really stressed out sometimes.
Has that happened before? Couple of times, yeah.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Nothing.
Nothing is wrong with you, okay? That was an anxiety attack, and I know because I get them too.
Really? [sighs] You both know what anxiety and depression are, right? Well, I have that.
And I didn't want to tell you because I don't wanna freak you guys out.
Are you okay? Are you not happy? Oh, honey, it has nothing to do with unhappiness.
It's a chemical imbalance, and it runs in our family.
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Even though I'm ashamed of it.
But that's something I'm trying to end with me, 'cause I'm fine now.
And you're gonna be fine too.
Wait.
Is this why you freak out on me all the time? No, that's me being legit mad at you 'cause you're a punk.
Fair.
I know this is gonna sound really weird, but I'm actually happy to hear this,Â 'cause I thought that I was just going crazy.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
Well, I haven't felt anything like that.
Good.
That's so good.
But if you ever do, we're here for you.
And if you need to see someone, we'll do that.
Okay.
Thanks.
And in the meantime, you both could meditate with me.
That always keeps me grounded.
Ooh.
Happy you're both okay, but, um, I'm gonna go do the thing that grounds me, looking in the mirror.
- I would love to meditate with you.
- Yes! I am so stoked to be calm, and I'm goingÂ to kill at meditation so hard.
I'm gonna be like, "What you looking at, Buddha?" Ooh, yeah.
You really need this.
Om.
Om.
Oh, Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
A sweet slice of orange for my sweet papito.
Really, Mami? If you always do everything for him, he'll never be able to do anything for himself.
- I'm fine with that.
- I'm fine with that.
Come on, Lupita.
Life has been torture for Papito since he has been imprisoned.
Grounded.
Imprisoned in this house.
And all because he wanted to spend some time with some girl named Mary Jane.
No, it's fine, Abuelita.
I need to learn my lesson.
How you doing with that list of chores I gave you? I'm almost done with all of them.
You're still working on this? We have eight more units to get through.
The green wire is extra.
Don't need to connect it to anything.
Isn't that the wire that trips the breaker if there's a power surge? Carry on.
Why you so stressed? Your aromatherapist out ofÂ town? Well, that's not helping, but no.
I'm worried about Father's visit.
I am really curious to meet your dad.
I picture the rich Monopoly guy.
No, that's my Uncle Doug.
God! Father's visit is stressing me oot! I haven't seen him since before I got sober.
Haven't you been sober for, like, eight years? Yeah, I'm not his favorite child.
Plus, he refused to come back to America till it was great again.
I have a feeling your father's going to make me want to take my earrings out and punch him in the throat.
Oh, definitely.
But please just roll with it.
All I want is to get through this and give him as little as possible to criticize.
That's why I poured my blood, sweat, and tears into fixing up the building.
I did all that.
You made me patch up the drywall 'cause you had just gotten a manicure.
Father says you can tell the quality of a man by the health of his cuticles.
A real man does not know what a cuticle is.
Anyway, I think he'll like the building, but my real ace in the hole is Avery.
He'll love her 'cause she's rich and beautiful, but he won't want to date her because she's over 30.
Oh, and please don't make fun of me when he calls me by my childhood nickname, Goldie, short for Golden Boy.
That's actually kind of sweet.
I was a bed-wetter.
[all] Oh.
This is itÂ  This is life, the one you get So go and have a ballÂ  This is itÂ  Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at allÂ  So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you doÂ  Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a timeÂ  So, up on your feetÂ  Somewhere there's music playingÂ  Don't you worry noneÂ  We'll just take it like it comesÂ  One day at a timeÂ  One day at a timeÂ  One day at a timeÂ  - One day at a timeÂ  - One day at a timeÂ  One day at a timeÂ  Papito, I am so excited.
We will spend the day together in the laundry room like besties.
Yeah, I'm excited too.
What happened to me? [knocking on door] Since when do you knock and dress like American Psycho? I always knock.
I'm the landlord.
It's a courtesy.
[groans] Did you join a cult again? Everyone, I'd like you to meet my father, Lawrence Fitzgerald Schneider.
Very nice to finally meet you.
You must be Avery.
- No.
- Oh, no, Avery's meeting us here in a minute.
This is my tenant, Penelope.
Oh.
Thank god.
Encantada.
Ah, una EspaÃ±ola.
Mucho gusto en conocerla.
Your Spanish is very good.
Escobar was an old friend.
Such a shame what happened.
Hi, I'm Alex.
Nice suit.
Oh, thank you.
A little boy like you made it for me.
So this is what a typical unit looks like, huh? Much better.
Looks like you two were about to check out our new, top-of-the-line laundry room.
Run along now.
And don't give me that rent late.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you something.
Oh! Uh, that's so thoughtful of you, sir, but I'm sober now.
Remember? But this is Don Julio Real.
He's got his own house.
It's still alcohol.
[knocking on door] Ooh, this must be Avery.
You're gonna love her.
Now that's more like it.
Ah! Mr.
Schneider, - it's such a pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.
You know, I met your father at the Bohemian Grove a while back.
Oh, dear! Was he orchestrating The Cremation of Care? As ever.
[chuckles] And we were also dueling skippers at the Mackinac Regatta.
Ah! Daddy once lost a Mackinac wager when his forestay snapped and his catamaran tacked starboard.
Ironically, it cost him his holdings in Pingtang! [both laugh] What the hell? - Shall we? - Yeah.
Was that even English? No, that was cha-ching-lish.
Oh, what happened? Everything is so different.
Yeah, they replaced the old machines that shook so hard they moved across the room.
Pero that's how I knew that the spin cycle was over.
They came up and smacked me on the nalgas.
It reminded me of your abuelo.
[giggles] [dryer plays tune] Schneider programmed them to play different songs when they're done.
Don't quit your day job, dryer.
Okay, and where do I put the quarters? You pay with your phone.
So dumb! [Alex chuckles] You'll get used to it, Abuelita.
Remember when you thought rays from the microwave would give Elena chest hair? We shall see.
Ay, your mother never empties her pockets.
Y quÃ© es esto? UhLooks like a pen set and some catnip.
[gasps] Dios mÃ­o! It is las drogas.
No! Why do you think that's drug stuff? I think someone's been writing letters to a cat.
No.
No, no, no, it is the vape.
I have seen it many times on Caso Cerrado.
[gasps] Alex! Your mami is addicted to the weeds.
Oh! Yes! [gasps] Mami! [sobs] Oh, hey, I was just showing Father the new sconces.
Oh! Did you try to pull on it to open up the secret entrance to the treasure room? [chuckles] That's all Bluetooth now.
But this is all very nice.
Impressive renovations, and you did it with your cuticles intact like a man.
I'm proud of you.
[gasps] You've never said that to me before.
You deserve it, son.
[gasps] You've never called me son before.
You finally earned it.
[phone buzzes] It's Dick Cheney! Hey, what's cracking, you old queen? Wow! He was almost not awful.
I know! And he loves the building.
[gasps] What did he like? The tankless water heater, the new mailbox hardware? Tell me everything.
He was very impressed with all your hard work.
You told him you did everythingÂ yourself, didn't you? He's my daddy! Plus, he loved Avery.
And not in the bad way.
He said she'd make a great first or fifth wife.
That's the highest compliment.
How is that a compliment? Well, the first wife is for breeding, the second is for spite, the third is to forget the second, the fifth is 30 years younger so it circles back to breeding, and of course, traditionally, the fourth wife'sÂ Asian.
I'm I'm just so tired.
Anyway, Father said it was ingenious that I picked the neighborhood when I did, because property values have gone through the roof.
That's not a great thing, Schneider.
It's gentrification.
No! This isn't gentrification.
That's bad.
This is good.
Everything's worth more.
Yes, property values go up for the owners, but businesses and working-class people get pushed out of their ownÂ neighborhoods because they can't affordÂ rent anymore.
That's the best news of all.
You won't be paying rent anymore, because - we're going condo! - What? Condo-leezza Rice! Wa-condo forever! My condo Well, that one doesn't work, but we're going condo! We are going condo Condo, condo, condo Why is no one else dancing? You guys dance when the mail comes.
Are you serious? Oh, my God! I did this.
All of my work contributed to gentrification.
I'm the white devil! I thought you were just trying to get through this.
Now you're selling the building? What happened? I know, but Father and I got to talking, and he said a lot of things that made sense, and then he said this is something that we could work on together.
I've been waiting for this my entire life.
Well, a bunch of hard-working families are gonna be out on the street.
But I'm glad that you and yourÂ daddy have a little project.
Why are you mad? This is gonna be great for you.
You can own your own home, but the monthly payments will be the same.
I don't have enough money for a down payment.
I buy Target furniture! From Goodwill! Just get one of those loans where you don't have to put anything down and youÂ only pay interest.
You mean the loans that broke America? When was this? Wow! Look, you're a veteran.
Can't you get a special loan? Or don't they, like, give you houses? They should give you houses.
You have no idea how the world actually works.
This is really gonna affect us.
But you obviously don't care.
[sighs] Of course I do.
But I have to do this.
Right.
You know, you can learn Spanish.
You can eat dinner with us.
You can pretend you're part of theÂ family.
But when it comes down to it, you are still the man and we're just your tenants.
Come on, Penelope.
That's not at all No, congratulations.
You are your father's son.
Get out.
- Penelope - No, I mean it.
Please, get out.
[exhales] I cannot believe that Lupe is on the wacky weed.
Get me a fried egg so I can show her what a brain looks like on drugs! I am never going to stop yelling at her! Oryou can say nothing.
[sighs exasperatedly] Quiet mad.
That's the worst kind of mad.
Si.
A silent Cuban is the deadliest of Cubans.
But first I yell! And I give her such a pow pow! Abuelita, it's mine.
Huh? What? It's my weed.
Mom found it in my room and must have left it in her pocket.
Is this why you have been grounded? Yeah.
Mami has been hiding it from you because I asked her to.
I just didn't want to let you down.
I'm so sorry, Abuelita.
Abuelita, say something.
[sighs] Thanks again for going through all my stuff on such short notice.
You can account on me, 'cause I'm an accountant.
That used to be on my business card.
I took it off.
That's good.
[sighs] I'm feeling kind of vulnerable showing you all my finances.
That's, like, 12th base.
Twelfth base? You're either really bad at baseball or really good at sex.
Okay, Mateo, focus.
Can I afford to buy this place? [Mateo exhales] I'm sorry, but even with your VA benefits, you'll be stretched pretty thin.
Especially with Elena going off to college next year.
Great.
We can't afford to live in Echo Park without rent control, which means we'reÂ gonna have to move, the kids are gonna have to switch schools, and I'll have a six-hour commute.
Maybe we live in the car 'cause Mami is small.
And I'll just start pumping Alex with coffee now so he doesn't have another growth spurt.
Penelope, calm down.
You're actually in pretty good shape.
You can still afford to live in LA.
Let's take a look at your expenses.
Do you always see yourself living with your mother? Come on.
You really gotta ask me that? We're Latinos.
She lives with me.
I'll live with the Elena.
We'll just keep passing on that curtain and I'll figure out a way to like cats.
[sighs] I could kill Schneider for doing this.
Plus, jail would be a free place to live.
Look, I get why you're mad.
But you see how much this neighborhood has changed and I see how little rent you pay.
Has Schneider ever raised your rent? Not since we moved in.
You've been paying the same rent for 17 years? He's a saint.
But yeah, screw that guy.
Let's kill him.
Well, I took down the man.
I slightly loosened all the sconces.
And I wrote "colonizer scum" on the wall outside! In chalk! Go wipe that off right now.
Okay! Abuelita, say something.
Anything! Tell me one of your stories.
Here, I'll even get you started.
[imitating Lydia] Havana, 1952 How can I make this better? I'll do anything.
I'll clean the house every day.
I'll let you pick out all my clothes.
I'll even shave my head.
[gasps] Ay, no.
Gracias a Dios.
Papito, you should have known better.
I am very disappointed in you.
I'm really sorry, Abuelita.
It was a mistake.
And I'll never do it again.
I did it too.
What? The marijuana.
I, too, rode the green dragon.
Oh! Is that why you were staring at the dryer? No, I accidentally ate one of Leslie's pot lozenges, and I became very Como se dice? lit.
Wait.
You got high? I got real high, baby.
And it was stupid.
And we must promise each other that we will never ever, ever, ever toss the devil's salad again.
We need to work on your slang, Abuelita.
But okay.
[sniffles] Don't cry.
- I said I'll never do it again.
- No, no, it's not that.
This is the first time you have ever kept a secret from me, and we don't do that.
We keep secrets from everyone else.
You know how we hide the good cookies in the oatmeal tin? And how you are the only person who knows I killed Elena's hermit crab with Fabuloso.
- I will take that to my grave.
- Ay.
Thank you.
[sighs] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to keep things from you.
I just didn't want you to hate me.
Ay, Papito! I could never.
You are mi vida.
But you are growing up and it makes me a little sad.
And soon, you will not want to spend time with me.
- Yes, I will.
- Yeah? I love hanging out with you.
Especially now that I know we can get stoned together.
[knocking on door] Hey.
Hey.
Come on in.
Sorry I kicked you out before.
But it's nice to know that you're actually capable of leaving my apartment when asked.
I'm so sorry, Pen.
I don't know what to say.
No, I'm sorry.
You caught me off guard.
This is your building.
And it is a good business decision.
And hell, if the shoe was on the other foot, I'd have kicked your ass out too.
Thanks.
[Schneider sighs] I can't expect you to push your father away because of us.
And I get it.
Family is everything, and no one knows that more than me.
The Alvarezes are gonna be okay.
And so are we.
[sighs] Great.
But I gotta say.
I don't think you should try so hard to become the man your father wants you to be.
Because I like the man you are just fine.
[Schneider sighs] What? Mar-a-Lago? But won't you be busy? [laughs] I'm kidding.
Okay, see ya.
Just got an appraisal on the units.
It was even higher than I thought it'd be.
Actually, Father, I've decided I'm not gonna take the building condo.
- What? - What? I really like everything the way it is.
You're screwing up the one thing you've done right in the last 20 years.
Well, this building is full of people I care about, and who care about me, and I don't want to screw that up.
Plus, I have enough money.
Enough money? I sent you to school in America so you could forget that polite, Canadian crap and learn some decent values.
My mind is made up.
This is incredible! I've given you everything and you've been a constant disappointment.
I put you through rehab three times.
If you were a better father, you'd know that you put me through rehab five times.
And you haven't given me everything.
I don't remember you ever once saying you loved me.
Oh, really? So this is about a little boy who's sad because Daddy never said I love you? Grow up, Goldie.
You know what? I'm officially done trying with you.
Then we have something in common.
Now get out of my building.
Gladly.
[door slams] That was freaking amazing! Where did that come from? Thanks.
[stammers] It felt amazing.
Oh, god! You didn't have to do that, but thank you.
Really, youyou didn't have to.
Yeah, I did.
Family's everything.
[Penelope sighs] Hey, you want to come over for dinner? You can invite Avery, and I'll even get out the good cookies that Mami and Alex hide in the oatmeal tin.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'll be right down.
- I justI just need a minute.
- Okay.
Oh, my god! We're staying! You're not gonna raise the rent, right? You know what?Â We're gonna talk about that later.
[exclaims] We're not going condo We're not going condoÂ  We're not going condo We're not goingÂ  No, no, no, we're staying! - Oh, thank god.
- Yeah.
[sighs] [theme music playing]
 Alex, your papi will be here any minute.
So get off your butt, turn all the pillows to their good side, and hide the ugly one in the closet.
Why are we cleaning for Papi anyway? We're cleaning for his new girlfriend.
And there's no way I'm gonna let that woman think that we live like sucios.
I cleaned under the bathroom sink.
So Papi's girlfriend will be impressed if she decides to steal a tampon.
So, what is the deal with your papi? I'm here for you, mija.
I can go from zero to flipping this table.
Asi.
II'm a little nervous to see him, but he says he's sober, and he says he's okay with me being gay.
You never know with him, so keep one hand under the table just in case.
And, Lupe, this new novia, am I pulling her hair? Am I spitting in her cafÃ©? It's fine.
You know, I'm happy for him.
She's probably blonde and thin and really excited to graduate college.
[knocking on door] [Penelope] Oh, here we go.
All right, everybody, let's all be nice to the Instagram model we'll probably never see again, okay? - Hey! - Papi! Hey, wow! Looking good, Lupe.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
So is the place.
Hey.
Ugly pillow in the closet? You know it.
So, you look good too.
Where'suh, Baby? I mean, Blondie.
I mean, your girlfriend.
Hey.
[chuckles] [both] Hi! [laughs] Oh, wow! Dang! Papi's got a type.
- Uh, come in.
Come in.
- Oh, okay.
- I love your hair.
- Oh, I love your hair.
Is that a ring? Uh, well, um, I thought we had a few more minutes of small talk before we got there, but, um, yeah.
Nicole is my fiancÃ©e.
- Surprise! [chuckles] - [exclaims] [grunts] [pants] I don't have it.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time Thank you for being so welcoming.
I know it must be awkward, Victor coming by with his new fiancÃ©e.
You think? It's not awkward.
It's just surprising.
You know, like, "Oh, that guy won the election? Really?" But it worked out fine.
[stammering] Listen, I am sorry.
I just didn't want to introduce you until things got really serious, but then they got really serious really fast.
Alex, I am so excited to meet you.
You're even more handsome in person than you are in photos.
All right! Welcome to the family.
And, Elena, your papi has told me so much about you.
Just so I know, what are your preferred pronouns? Oh! Well, my pronouns are she and her, and Syd, my significant other, identifies as they.
Thank you for asking.
"She, they.
" How do we keep people straight? So you wanna keep people straight? No, Elena, that's not what I meant.
[in unison] Okay.
My little sister, Mia, identifies as queer, and she's teaching me how to be an ally so I can pass it on to my students.
- Oh, you're a teacher? - Yeah.
I'm a special education teacher at an elementary school.
Isn't she amazing? Yeah, and age-appropriate.
Nothing to hate.
[laughs] [chuckles] Did you think I was going to be some young, blonde flaquita? [laughs] This is gonna put me in therapy.
[door opens] - Hey, Pen.
What up, hombre? - Whoa.
[laughs] Hey! So, where's this girlfriend? Hey, Pen.
Wait.
What? Hey, Schneider, uh, this is my fiancÃ©e, Nicole.
What? FiancÃ©e? That's great.
- Wait.
Am I mad about this? - All good.
- Locked it down, dawg! - Yeah.
- So, you got a best man yet? - Uh, no, no.
What's with the arms? You don't have a lot of friends in LA, so obviously, I'm your best man.
I'm gonna plan your bachelor party.
Hashtag Vic-turn it up.
[chuckles] No, no, I don't need any of that.
Nicole's friends are throwing her a little bachelorette thing, and I'm just gonna take Elena and Alex to dinner.
A dad-chelor party! [laughs] I could work with that.
I'll go get my cargo shorts and braided belt.
[door closes] Does he understand he's not invited? Not since I've known him.
Well, we should get going.
It was so lovely to meet you.
It was so great to meet you.
Thank you so much for those flowers.
- Gracias, linda.
- Mucho gusto.
- [Lydia] Nice to meet you.
- [Penelope] Have a good time.
[Lydia] Hey, listen, don't be a stranger.
[chuckles] I can't stand her! Mami, she's fine.
But who is she trying to fool with that sexy laugh? Ay, paquete! The whole situation is very, very fishy.
Well, he's marrying his rebound, so [scoffs] And you have had more rebounds.
As I heard it on the SportsCenter, whoever has the most rebounds wins.
And now, you have Mateo.
Right! That guy.
He is so sweet.
He's been texting me all morning.
I gotta text him back.
I don't know.
Something is off with Victor.
- It's too quick.
- Hmm.
I am going to keep an eye on him and his new bae.
I will be on bae watch.
Okay.
But let's not get all worked up about Nicole and Victor.
They're going on with their lives, and we should go on with ours.
I'm so freaking mad! I'm the one that turned that mess into that sexy hyena's dream man.
I get that you're upset, Penelope, but I think the group is having a hard time following you.
Her ex got his crap together, and now, he's engaged to a woman named Nicole.
Keep up, Pam.
- [sighs] - So, he went from a Penny to a Nicole? [all laughing] - That's funny.
- Shut up! This sucks! Why do you think this is so activating? Is there a part of you that imagined you and Victor would get back together? Hell no, Pam.
[sighs] It's like this.
Let's say you took in a stray dog.
You fed him, bathed him, busted your butt to get him healthy.
Then that dog up and ran away.
A few years later, you're watching a dog show, and guess who won the blue ribbon? That damn mutt you saved! You trained that dog.
You deserve that ribbon, and that dog should die alone.
I'm not sure that's the healthiest response.
You should have had him neutered.
- Exactly.
- Yes.
I know a shady vet.
Want me to hook it up? - Ramona.
- [scoffs] It's not fair! You know, he's moving on, and I've got no one.
What about Mateo? Right, that guy.
I gotta text him back.
It's clear that this encounter has triggered some insecurities.
I recommend some quiet time alone so that you can really process these feelings.
I'm getting over this tonight! [all] Whoo! As the front-runner for best man, I got you a little something for your dad-chelor party.
Bam! "V.
A.
G"? Victor Alvarez Guapisimo.
Yeah, I'm not wearing a hat that says vag.
I'll wear it.
[cawing] Lydia, what are you doing here? I need you to invite me to the party so I can spy on Victor.
I think I think he's drinking again.
What? No, that's crazy.
He's sober.
He wouldn't drink.
No, I don't think he's sober anymore.
When he drinks, he's impulsive and irrational, and that is why he is rushing into a marriage with dollar-store Lupita.
Come on.
Victor's sober.
Sure, he's had his hard days.
I know that better than anybody.
But he's committed.
He has too much to lose.
I'm just worried about the children.
I don't want to see them hurt again.
Y por eso, I must watch his every move.
But what if he sneaks off to the bar? I recruited a spy.
Oh, hi.
Wow! I barely recognized you, Dr.
B.
Don't say my name.
Tonight, I am undercover.
Another mudslide, Mr.
Iglesias? Si, seÃ±or.
And keep them coming.
- [sighs] - Look who I found.
[laughs] She's my plus-one.
Hope that's okay.
Yeah, sure.
Wouldn't be a dad-chelor party without my ex-wife's mother.
What are you wearing? [gasps] "VAG"? Oh! Victor Alvarez Guapisimo.
I want one.
Seriously? A special ed teacher? The one thing you can't make fun of? She did that on purpose.
Another round, ladies? - Sorry.
Our Uber's here.
- Ugh! Bye.
- [whines] - [Jill] I'm out too.
The last time I had this many shots, I slept with my weed delivery guy.
[laughs] So, later, locas.
I'm staying.
Oh, yes! Ramona, my ride or die! Hey, have a seat.
Two more, please.
[Penelope] You know, maybe Pam was onto something.
Like, maybe III am hung up on this because I'm insecure about where I'm at in my life.
But you got no reason to be, though.
You're raising two smart kids.
You got a boyfriend blowing up your phone.
- Right, that guy! I gotta text him back.
- [Ramona] Yeah.
You're about to be a nurse practitioner.
And your body is tight! I'm telling you, lady, if you were gay, and my knees weren't arthritic I would get down there Whoa! What? Propose to you.
Ew! Get your mind out of the gutter! But how drunk are you? [both laughing] Seriously, Penny, forget Nickel.
You are the baddest bitch in here.
It's my bachelorette party, and I'm the baddest bitch in here! [all] Whoo! I know that this is all happening really quick, so I wanted to talk to you guys.
Oh, yes, tell us.
Yeah, let's crack that egg open and get right to the yolk.
[sighs] Uh, well I was thinking it would be, uh, just me and the kids, but, umokay.
[laughs] Uh Well, I know this seems fast, but Nicole is a really great person, and I would love it if you guys would get to know her.
So I hope you can spend some time with us this week.
Papi, before I answer, I need to know something.
Does your hotel have a pool? [sighs, chuckles] Yes.
Then I'm in.
So[chuckles] Nicole is from Portland, huh? I hear they have a huge LGBTQ+ community.
Oh, yeah, they have a parade, like, every week.
[scoffs] Oh, is that a bad thing? No.
No.
I I mean, when I'm trying to get to work, it is, but, uh, well, that would be true of aof a straight parade.
[stammers] I'm anti-parade.
Yeah.
[clears throat] Anyway, Nicole's sister, Mia, she goes to them all the time.
Oh, so, you're cool with her.
Did you go to her quinces? Why don't you use this awkward moment to refresh my rum and Coke? It is weaker than a woman who claims that childbirth is painful.
Okay.
What a gentleman, huh? I gotta go to the bathroom.
If there's gonna be a big, dramatic scene, wait till I get back.
Of course.
I can't flip this table by myself.
Uh, can we make this rum and Coke fit for a Cuban grandma? No Coke.
Good order.
I also like a rum and Coke-caine.
Excuse me? Oh, I was just saying how much I enjoy the occasional soda, especiallywith a little happy juice.
- UhHey.
- Oh! Cheers.
- Oh.
Okay.
Uh - [laughs] Thank you.
Thanks.
Uh, but this isn't my drink.
Oh, come on.
It's not like I'm some honey trap.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you okay? You're looking a little, uh, unsteady there, buddy.
Says the guy with three heads.
Wow.
You know, I've been there.
Listen, ifif you ever want to quit, give me a call.
I'll save a seat for you.
Yeah.
Uh, can we call a cab for this guy? Just add it to my bill.
Bless your heart.
[all cheering] You know what me and her ending up at the same bar is? A beatdown waiting to happen.
I know a lawyer who can make it look like she started it.
- Want me to hook it up? - No! It's a sign.
I need to tell Nicole the truth about the man she's gonna marry.
Yeah, I don't think Hey, girl.
Penelope.
Uh, everyone, this is Victor's ex-wife.
[all] Oh! I know.
I told you, right? She's gorgeous.
Penelope, sit.
Be a unicorn with me.
- [slurring] Right, but we do need to talk.
- Yes, yes.
Yeah.
Before you say anything, can I just say thank you? For what? For being an amazing woman who pushed Victor to be the man he is today.
He told me every horrible thing he put your through when he was at his lowest, and the fact that you had the strength to leave him so that he could realize that he needed to get help, and how you managed to salvage the relationship between him and your kids.
[sighs] Girl! [laughing] Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.
I'm sorry for interrupting.
What did you want to tell me? [all cheering] You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
[in unison] We're so beautiful! [both laughing] [both sigh] [sniffling] I came here tonight to get drunk and forget about you and Victor.
And it's not because I'm not over him.
I am.
I cried for months until I had no tears left.
But I became whole again.
And I love the life I've built as a single mom.
But selfishly, I want him to be miserable.
And I totally get that.
If it's any comfort, he was miserable for a really long time.
[scoffs] Till he became Mr.
Perfect.
[laughs] Oh! Victor's not perfect.
But I love him.
He makes me laugh.
He makes me feel safe.
When I think about something bad happening to him I get so upset.
[laughs] I just can't picture my life without him.
I mean, it's inevitable.
Women live longer.
I'll bounce back.
[sighs] I'm sorry.
[laughs] This isn't helping you feel better, is it? No.
But I know what you mean.
You're marrying the love of your life, and that's really special.
Victor tells me that you are dating a really sweet guy, Mateo.
Right.
That guy.
[laughs] I gotta text him back.
- Did I miss anything? - We were talking about the wedding.
I'm available.
Unless it's at the end of September.
Early spring's no good either.
Oh, and I'd love to keep my summer open.
Why don't I just send you some dates? Alex, Elena? Can I count on you two being there? Papi, I'll come to all of your weddings if you come to all of mine.
Oh, my God.
Wellgreat.
[chuckles] Elena? I want to lay down some ground rules.
I'm not gonna hide the fact that I'm gay.
Okay.
And I'm definitely going to wear my white suit.
No.
No, absolutely not.
I knew it.
This is all a show, but you are never gonna be okay with who I am.
Elena, you can't wear the white suit because you need to wear a tuxedo.
What? I want you and Alex to be my best man and my best woman.
Best people.
I mean, if Elena's cool with it.
I mean, you really want me to be your best woman? II would love that.
Yes.
[chuckles] This is so sweet.
Nepotism.
Victor, what a lovely gesture! Thank you.
Thank you, Lydia.
I'm really happy with my life now.
Turns out this whole not drinking thing is good for me.
I never doubted you.
Feeling horny? Oh! [laughs] I'm sorry I was ignoring your texts.
That's okay.
I wanted to talk to you about something, not necessarily while you smell of tequila returning from Therapy.
No, but Now.
Let's talk now, yeah? Okay.
Well, what I wanted to say is I started talking to my ex-wife again, and we decided to give it another shot.
Oh.
Oh, man! I know.
No, it's because I was coming over to break up with you.
What? See, it's like this, Mateo.
When I think about something bad happening to you, II don't get upset.
In fact, I don't even care.
Wow.
Sick burn! IThat's not how I meant it.
[sighs] I think you're great.
And I care about you.
But what we havehad It's nice, but it's not Yeah.
Anyway, I'm glad that we're both on the same page.
This is good.
I know it might be weird at first but eventually, do you think we could be friends again? Of course.
On one condition.
What's that? If anyone at school asks, I dumped you.
[laughs] [both laugh] [announcer talking on TV] - Oh.
- [TV turns off] Hey, how was it? Great.
I'm gonna be the best man, and Elena's gonna be the best woman at Papi's wedding.
I'm gonna rock a tux like Diddy at the Met Gala.
Ooh! And I'm gonna rock my tux like Jacques Dubochet.
He won a Nobel Prize for chemistry.
Hello! [laughing] Okay, that's great.
Mami, Dr.
Berkowitz called for you.
Oh, right, that guy.
[chuckles] I gotta text him back.
So, I guess things went well.
They did.
It was nice to have some quality time with the kids and your mother - and your landlord.
- Oh.
[chuckles] Not that you need it, but I totally approve of Nicole.
You really pulled your life together.
I'm happy for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That really means a lot to me.
Listen, I don't know exactly how to say this, so I'll just say it.
I don't want Schneider around the kids anymore.
What? Why not? He's drinking again.
And who knows what else? No.
No, no way! No, he's eight years sober.
He went to the bathroom four times, and he smelled like mouthwash.
I know all the tricks.
Look, I know he's your friend, but this is about the kids.
Look into it.
I'm really sorry.
Mami, we need to talk.
Hold on.
I'm watching the President.
Oh, wait.
It is a hemorrhoid commercial.
Hold up.
I-I couldn't sleep last night because Victor told me he thinks Schneider fell off the wagon.
You know, my cousin Miguel fell off the wagon once.
And he rolled down a hill into a cave of bats and lived among them for many years, and to this day, he can see in the dark.
Oh, my God.
- Mami, this is serious.
- Okay.
I haven'tÂ noticed any signs of Schneider slipping.
Have you? - Well, what are the signs? - Not showing up for work.
So he has been drunk for the last 20 years? All right, that's a good point.
Uh, spending money recklessly is another sign.
But this is the guy who, while sober, bought wax statues of Ice Cube, Ice-T, and Vanilla Ice.
Alcohol.
Is there any alcohol missing? [gasps] My rum is gone.
Wait.
That was me.
Maybe we should go check in on him, because if he was drinking last night, he will be a hungover mess today.
[knock on door] What up, fam? Beautiful day.
Got up at 6:00.
Crushed a smoothie, went to goat yoga.
Ironically, the instructor had a camel toe.
Drunk, sober.
Who can tell? Yoga, huh? Let me ask you a question.
Did you do this move? - Yeah.
- Did you do this move? - Yeah.
- Did you do this move? [glugs] What's that? Thirsty Warrior? Ach.
Are you using again? Booze, pills, sticky icky icky? What? Where's this coming from? Victor thinks you slipped.
Did you? Oh, my God.
I'm fine.
Addicts always think everyone's an addict, just like Elena thinks everyone's gay, and Lydia thinks everyone's in love with her.
Stop flirting with me and get to the point.
Schneider, you know we care about you, so I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Are you drinking? Okay, the truth is, I did think about having a drink when my dad was in town, but I didn't, and I promise you, I'm fine.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna change into something a little more comfortable.
He's definitely drinking again.
What? You saw him.
He's his normal self.
Oh, yeah? 'Cause before he came in, he knocked.
[wheezes] - [Gloria Estefan] This is it - Oh-oh-oh-oh This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball - This is it - Oh-oh-oh-oh Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight, we'll muddle through One day at a time - So, up on your feet - Patria.
Somewhere, there's music playin' Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time Yep.
One day at a time One day at a time [Gloria scatting in Spanish] One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time School zone? Reduce speed to under 25.
Yes.
Nun crossing the street? Do not hit her.
Yes.
Did you really need to put that on a flashcard? I know you've never passed a test before, but this is how it's done.
Why are you wearing your nicest shirt to the DMV? Because this place is jam-packed with 16-year-old girls with cars.
'Sup, girl? Sick Mazda.
Uhh.
You came here to hit on girls? You can't even go out with anybody.
You're still grounded.
Girls love what they can't have.
After you get your license, maybe you could drive me to the mall.
I need to get something for Lydia.
Our one-year non-iversary is comin' up.
What's a non-iversary? It's one full year since your grandmother first told me that she had absolutely no romantic feelings for me.
I should get her something.
I will drive you anywhere you want because you're the best teacher ever, and I am gonna crush this test.
[squeak] [car doors open and close] I should've hired a driving instructor instead of relying on a family friend.
Why did I waste so much time making flashcards? Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
I'm actually gonna fail.
- Elena, relax.
- Relax? No.
I'm never gonna get my license.
I'm never gonna get a job.
I'm gonna live at home forever.
Then Syd is gonna leave me for a soft butch with a Subaru.
[breathes heavily] Okay, I think you're having an anxiety attack.
Here, sit down and just take a deep breath.
Think about something calming, like that Supreme Court lady you like Darth Vader Ginsburg.
You mean the tiny old lady clinging to life with one hand and to our frail democracy with the other? Oh, God, she's right.
[breathes heavily] - Calm down, Doc.
- I can't.
If Elena fails, it'll all be my fault.
They always say, "If you can't do, teach.
" But if you can't teach, what is there? [both hyperventilate] Okay.
Man, I thought the DMV was gonna be fun.
- Lupita, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
- What? How are we going to play this? Who is the law? Who is the order? [imitates Law & Order theme] No.
Schneider's not even home, Mami.
We're just gonna go in, take a quick look around, and make sure he's not hiding anything, okay? Ah, okay.
Okay, Mami, let's spread out.
You go look in the cactus garden.
I'll check out the wax museum.
- Oh, Mami, look! - [squeals] Oh, deodorant.
Good.
I'm sweating.
No.
Mami, this is a fake can for hiding drugs.
- [gasps] - This is what Alex had.
Yes.
You just twist it.
Ooh.
Uhh? Now I smell like a horny eighth-grader.
Oh, look.
A giant smoking bing-bong.
Mami, that's too big to be a bong.
I'm guessing.
[door opens] [both yelp] It's actually a didgeridoo.
[plays horribly] [extends off-key note] [continues horrible playing] And not one lesson.
We thought you were at the Farmers Market.
Yeah, well, the figs were sub-par today, so I came home disappointed.
Now I'm even more disappointed to come home and find my best friend and her daughter sneaking into my apartment.
It is true.
I have violated the bro code.
You know what? I don't care.
Get mad at me all you want, okay? You're hiding something, and I'm gonna find out what it is.
Let me see if your pupils are dilated.
What? Stop.
I told you, I'm not drinking.
I went through a really hard time where I was tempted to, so you're not making things easier on me.
- I just want you to be honest with me.
- I am.
I've never lied to you.
Other than once when I told you chartreuse was your color when really, it's nobody's color.
Look, I'm sensitive, okay? I've been through this before with Victor.
By the time I confronted him, it was too late.
Well, I'm not Victor.
I've always been there for this family.
And the fact that you, of all people, think I'm a liar makes me feel like crap.
I'm sorry.
Well, you should be.
Oh.
Ahh.
What is this? That's not my yoga mat.
Okay.
I screwed up.
- We should get ahold of your sponsor.
- You're right.
Uhh.
I'm so ashamed.
I'll text Nick right now.
I can't believe I let this happen.
Thanks, guys.
You probably saved my life by catching me before I hit bottom.
Okay, Nick's on his way.
Good, because we're not going anywhere until he gets here.
- Thank you, but you don't have to do that.
- No, we do.
- Is there more booze in thisÂ apartment? - No.
- Are you lying to me? - Yes.
There's a bottle of vodka in the freezer.
Wax Ice-T is full of Long Island Iced Tea.
[Lydia] Schneider, there is no iced tea in Ice-T.
[Penelope] Yeah, I don't see any vodka, Schneider.
Schneider! Oh, boy.
He sent us on a wild Grey Goose chase.
Okay.
Are you feeling better? Yeah, I think so.
This pug with a wig looks just like Dame Judi Dench.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Yeah, I'm feeling better, too.
Well, you should.
You're gonna do great.
You're up.
Thanks, Alex.
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna make this test my bitch.
You can't say that.
I can.
Let's do this thing.
Well, my work here is done.
Plus, I made a date with a girl who failed the test four times.
She needed a win.
Wait.
Wait.
I still need help with your grandmother's non-iversary gift.
Okay.
Well, the traditional gift for a first non-iversary is nothing, because that's not a thing.
[chuckles] Okay, here's a picture of Abuelita's bouquet list.
Maybe you can get an idea from it.
That's private.
I can't look at that.
Without my reading glasses.
"Take a hot-air balloon ride.
" No can do.
I'm afraid.
- Heights? - Baskets.
Let's see.
"Kiss AndyÂ Garcia.
" "Kiss Julio Iglesias.
" "Kiss the ugly Property Brother to make the handsome Property Brother jealous.
" [chuckles] This part of the list was after she had some rum.
"Buy more rum.
" I've got it.
There's one on here that I can make happen, and I know she'll love.
It's perfect.
Oh, I I can't let you see it.
It has to be a surprise.
Great.
Because I don't care.
I just want my phone back.
Oh.
Thank you.
Okay, let us know if you hear from him.
You're the person he's most likely to call in a crisis.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
Avery hasn't seen him? That was his almond milker.
But Avery hasn't seen him, either.
She says they broke up.
iAi, que triste! Well, I-I-I checked with all our neighbors.
Nada.
[door opening] Mami, that's the kids.
Don't say anything.
I don't want them to get freaked out.
Okay.
So? What has two thumbs and a provisional driver's license to be used only betweenÂ the times of 5:00 a.
m.
and 11:00 p.
m.
with no passengers under the age of 20 without a licensed driver aged 25 or higher present? This guy! [laughter] Yay.
Congratulations.
I am so proud of you.
It was pretty intense.
I actually started to have an anxiety attack, but Alex helped me through it.
Really? It was nothing.
Â I knew what to do because of everything we talked about.
- [cell phone vibrates] - Ah, sorry.
My phone's blowing up with crying girls who didn't get their licenses.
Wait.
How are they gonna get to me? No! I didn't think this through.
Don't worry.
I will find you an Uber.
Elena, your name is now Uber.
So much to celebrate.
Sparkling cider? Yep, and I sprung for the good stuff.
Ahh.
Martinelli's? Ooh, we're gonna party like slightly rebellious Mormons.
Thank you, Alex.
I knew you would pass.
Why do you think it's chilled? [grunts] Alex.
No, I really couldn't have done this without you.
You were there for me andOw! Oh, my God! Oh, don't worry.
It's okay.
No, my shirt! I need to wash it before it stains.
[man] Ow! [groans] Schneider? Alex, hey, man.
Are you doing a load? 'Cause I think I threw up on my pants.
Oh.
Dude, what happened? Uh I think I ate something that didn't agree with me.
Are you drunk? What? No.
- I thought you quit a long time ago.
- [sighs] Yeah, well, I recentlyquit quitting.
It's all right.
I'm just gonna go upstairs take a hot shower, and I'll be good as new.
Are you sure you're okay? - I think we should call somebody.
- No! I'm sorry.
I just It's not a big deal.
It's not gonna happen again, so don't tell your mom you found me down here.
Come on! She's just gonna freak out and overreact like she did with you 'cause you smoked a little weed.
How long did she ground you for? Four months and counting.
So you get it? Yeah.
I do.
You did the right thing calling us.
Here, Schneider, I made you sopa de pollo.
And, uh, I got you a wet towel for your head.
I don't know if it actually works.
They just always did it on Nurse Jackie.
Thanks, guys.
[sighs] They say while you're staying sober, your disease is doing push-ups.
Thought I could drink like I used to, but, uh guess I'm out of practice.
We love you.
And you're gonna get through this.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and try to clean up.
Okay, Schneider, but you need a hug.
Heh heh.
Okay, he's clean.
Alex, I, uh It's all good.
- Come here.
I wanna talk to you.
- [door closes] Mom, I get it.
Cautionary tale.
Scared straight.
No, that's not what I wanted to say.
I am really proud of how you handled everything today.
You helped Elena through an anxiety attack.
Dr.
Berkowitz called me and said you helped solve his biggest problem.
I couldn't even narrow that down.
Plus Schneider.
It takes a mature kid to know what to do when faced with something like that.
I guess I just realized he needed help more than he needed someone to keep his secret.
Well, you were right.
And that's why, as of ironically, 4:20 [chuckles] you are officially ungrounded.
Really? - Yeah.
- Yes! Now go out, have some fun and in an added plot twist ba-bam! Whoa.
A twenty-dollar bill? I saw these in a rap video once.
Thanks, Mom.
Hey, Uber, bring the car around.
I can't drive you unless we have someone 25 or older in the car.
You're in luck.
I just squeaked by.
- [door closes] - [door opens] Thanks, you guys, for the soup and for understanding They're gone, so enough of the b.
s.
My son has to find you passed out in a laundry room? How long has this been going on? And tell me the fricking truth this time.
It actually did start when my dad was here.
You been lying to us for that long? What the hell, Schneider? I know.
It's justahh.
Seeing him again reminded me of how he always said I was bad at everything.
But it's not true.
I was really good at one thing drinking.
I could always drink way more than everybody else.
It made me interesting and fun.
And when he was here, I had one drink.
And I actually managed to stand up to him.
So I started thinking, "Why does it have to be all or nothing? I can handle a drink now and then.
" But obviously, I can't.
What are you doing? I'm removing my eight-year chip.
I don't deserve to be in the Alvarez Museum anymore.
I blew it.
You're never gonna trust me again.
You know the first time you asked me to take Alex to his baseball game was one of the proudest moments of my life.
Nobody ever asks the addict to do that kind of stuff.
But you did.
You're the only one who's ever trusted me, Pen.
All that goes away now.
It doesn't go away.
It's just gonna be hard to get back.
Eight years.
Gone.
And now the thought of going back to a meeting and starting over? I can't do it.
Yes, of course you can.
And you will.
I'm not giving up on you.
None of us are.
If you don't start going back to meetings, you're just gonna keep slipping.
You want to be a good role model for the kids, right? This is your chance.
Someone once told me, "Don't quit before the miracle happens.
" That's pretty smart.
Who said that? Ha ha.
You did, dummy.
I just don't know if I can face those guys.
You don't have to do that alone.
Hi.
My name is Pat, andI'm an alcoholic.
- Hey, Pat.
- Hi, Pat.
Today is day one for me.
[mouths] Okay, 10-minute break.
- I'm glad you're back, dude.
- Thanks, man.
I'm always here for you, even if I'm putting up 500 pounds on the bench or out with some model or on myÂ yacht playing D&D with the homies.
But next time, call your sponsor.
Before.
Yeah.
And I might call you, too.
For other reasons.
It was really cool of Victor to invite us to his wedding.
You're his ex-wife's landlord, and I'm his ex-mother-in-law's non-sexual, platonic companion.
We're practically family.
But, are you going to be okay? II mean, with all that alcohol around.
Oh.
Yeah.
Thirty days sober.
I'm starting to feel like myself again.
I just wish Avery was coming.
- You still haven't heard from her? - No.
I tried everything.
Calling, texting, a plane in the sky with a banner that said, "I love Avery.
Sorry, baby.
" But they spaced it wrong, so it just said, "I love a very sorry baby.
" Anyway, I think it's over.
It is never over.
There will be many single ladies at the wedding today, and I will find you the perfect match.
I even put it in my bouquet list.
Lydia, I don't want to sound too forward, but[purrs] [sighs] Do I look too perfect? I don't want to outshine the bride.
[laughs] Just kidding.
Yes, I do.
[gasps] Papito! GuapÃ­simo! You look like a movie star.
And, Elena, you look like a very important member of his entourage.
Anyway We still got a minute 'cause Mami is still gettingÂ ready.
How is she doing? Wellit's an unusual situation, and and she isHow do I say this? [Penelope shouts] Who took my pumice stone? - Flipping out.
- Mm-hmm.
So when she comes out, make sure to compliment how great she looks.
Am I on a runway in Milan right now? [purrs] Okay.
I get it, okay? Thank you.
Thank you, but you don't have to worry about me.
Yeah, I know that this is all a little weird, but I am going to be just fine.
That's great.
Take your time getting ready.
Oh, like I'm in a hurry to cram myself into some Spanx so I can watch my ex-husband marry a less-cute me? Alex, where is her pumice stone? And remind me to thank your father for scheduling the weirdest day of my life right before my board exams.
I should be studying all day, but instead, I had to study all night.
So you didn't get any sleep? I didn't get any sleep! Now, I get to have 150 people look at me with pity and say to me, "Don't worry.
You'll find someone.
" - Oh, but you will find someone.
- Shut it! There are only two kinds of people that go to their ex-husband's wedding, psychopaths and heroes.
Guess which one I am.
I'm a hero! Now, let's go! When she comes back in, nobody make eye contact.
I found the pumice stone.
This is it This is life, the one you get So go and have a ball This is it Straight ahead and rest assured You can't be sure at all So while you're here, enjoy the view Keep on doing what you do Hold on tight We'll muddle through One day at a time So, up on your feet Somewhere there's music playing Don't you worry none We'll just take it like it comes One day at a time One day at a time One day at a time - One day at a time - One day at a time One day at a time [string quartet playing] Hey, Mami, so that girl family? Not family? Cousin's cousin.
No blood relation.
Go for it,Â baby.
Look at this.
Two minutes in, and he's already found someone.
[laughs] And you will too.
You're so brave to be here.
Thank you.
This is actually really nice.
Look how happy the kids are.
- I know.
- I'm glad I came.
Everyone was so worried I wouldn't be able to handle this, but I'm doing just fine.
["Bridal Chorus" playing] Oh, no! Hola, Lupe.
You look very nice.
Thank you, Papi.
What's happening? Obviously, you are having a moment of self-reflection.
You imagine yourself as the bride at your ex-husband's wedding.
Totally normal.
And the seeing dead people part? Okay, that's a little weird.
But go with it.
Let's figure out what's troubling you, mija.
- Are you still in love with Victor? - What? No! I thought he was the love of my life, but no, he's not.
Hmm.
So, you're worried that you may not find the love of your life? I don't know.
Maybe.
Part of the problem is that Mami found you, and you set the bar too high.
It is true.
I am amazing.
I can't help thinking that this is unfair.
Victor gets his happy ending.
Where's mine? Mijita.
You know the answer already.
No.
Don't give me that it's-all-inside-me caca.
Just tell me what to do.
- And do you, Penelope, take Victor? - [laughs] No, thank you.
I'm really happy for you and Nicole.
Pa Papi? You may kiss the bride.
This must be killing you.
[sighs] Pobre Schneider! I know you are sad about losing your girlfriend, - but you are really pooping this party.
- [sighs] I know.
I can't stop thinking about Avery.
I gotta move on, but it's hard.
Well, of course.
It takes time to heal.
Leslie, it's go-time.
Wait.
What? This is Anna-Maria.
She's a swimsuit model.
[chuckles] Hi.
Ugh! Fine.
Let the sparks fly! Lydia, there's something on your bouquet list that I can help you check off, something big.
Oh, Leslie[gasps]what is it? I'm taking you to Cuba.
Was that a Cuban way of saying thank you? Leslie, I am so sorry.
My body rejects even theÂ idea of setting foot in Cuba.
While I would love it more than anything, it would be too painful to return.
But on your bouquet list, you say, "Spread Berto's ashes in Cuba.
" Clearly, what I meant was go to Miami, find a pier, wait until sundown, play Berto's favorite song, and then spread the ashes on the ocean, so he can find his way back to Cuba.
He's an excellent swimmer.
It's so obvious in retrospect.
Hmm.
But I really want to do something for you.
[Lydia] Oh! What about this? Can I take you to Miami? Leslie, that is so sweet.
[gasps] We can even stay together.
Different rooms, but the same hotel this time.
Hot dog! I am booking the flights.
No, Leslie.
The same flight.
Wow.
So, Berto's ashes was the last thing on my list.
There is still so much left to do.
Well, let's get to it.
What's next? A tattoo? What's the matter? You nervous about your toast? Just picture everyone naked, except for TÃ­o Frank.
He has a nipple on his elbow.
[both] Ugh! No, I just I feel a little weird being in a suit in front of all these people, and I'm just having some flashbacks.
[sighs] I mean, everybody seems cool, but a lot of them were at my quinces, and some of them probably feel the same way Papi does.
The way Papi did.
That was two years ago.
So many things have changed.
I have a mustache now.
No, you don't.
Shut up.
I shave it.
[DJ] Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, Mr.
and Mrs.
Victor Alvarez.
- [crowd applauds] - [upbeat music playing] Not the first time ever, but I'm gonna let that go.
[camera shutters clicking] I don't understand what happened with this one.
He seems great.
We do make a nice picture.
[shutter clicks] But there was just no spark.
Lupe, it is time I was completely honest with you.
Everyone thinks your mami and I were so passionate, but the truth is, we had sex strictly for procreation.
Nice try, Papi.
[laughs] I know.
I could barely get through it.
Are you sure? Maybe with a little time love could blossom.
He could be your happy ending.
Um, nope.
So boring! We're still buddies, though.
- See, Papi? That felt right.
- [shutter clicks] And you're gone again.
[shutter clicks] Don't worry.
I started a rumor that her tatas are fake.
Pass it along.
And as a wise man once said, "Love is the three-point shot you should always take.
" It was me.
And congrats on nothing but net, Papi, to you and Nicole.
[crowd applauds] - You got this.
- Thank you.
[clears throat] When I was little, uh, my papi would braid my hair and watchÂ Disney movies with me over and over again without complaining.
So he's a hero.
- [crowd laughs] - [Elena laughs] No, really, people like to throw that word around, but my dadÂ joined the Army out of a selfless need to protect the people that he loved.
And he's not only a hero because he gaveÂ years of his life to this country, or because he knows all the choreography to High School Musical.
That's right.
[laughs] My dad is a hero because, when his life was falling apart, he was able to put it back together, and in doing so, found love.
And I am so happy for you, Papi.
Congrats to you both.
[crowd applauds] Oh, you'll find someone.
[wedding party member] Whether she's teaching special ed or Nice work.
I even got choked up, and it's hard to make a man with a mustache cry.
[scoffs] Why are you in here? Ugh! You're not putting S in front of all the "hes" in the Bible again, are you? I hated my toast.
What are you talking about? It was really nice.
I meant everything I said.
I just have more to say.
But it's his wedding, and I don't want to be a jerk.
Okay.
So how about you make the toast you wanted to make? Just do it for me.
And, you know, her.
It'll be good for you to get it out.
[sighs] - Okay.
- Yeah.
[exhales deeply] Hi, everybody.
I'm Elena Alvarez.
You might remember me as the girl who was abandoned by her dad in the father-daughter dance of her quinces.
Hi.
How you doing? Nice to see you.
[sighs] Papi, I know you're trying.
That doesn't erase all the bad stuff that happened, and everything's not okay yet.
And today, it was me making sure everybody was comfortable, and me saying nice things about you, and me showing up for you onÂ your big day when you didn't show up for me on mine.
[crying] I should not have to be doing all of the work.
[sniffling] The bigger person shouldn't have to be the kid.
Anyway, Nicole seems really nice.
Congrats.
[chuckles] It's good you did not make that your toast.
[laughs] - Do you feel better? - Yeah.
[Lydia] Thank you, Leslie.
Now, all the punks will know that I ride with Papito.
Thank goodness we found face painter at the bar mitzvah next door.
Thank you, Cookie the kosher clown.
Heads up.
The potato salad has shrimp in it.
[Victor] Okay, everybody, if it's all right, I'd like to say something.
[sighs] Uh, Nicole and I are so happy that you all are here.
Um[sighs] My kids they said, um, a lot of nice things about me.
But, um they left out a bunch of stuff too.
There was a time when I was not in a good place.
And I left my family.
And I was particularly terrible to my daughter when she was coming out.
So, in front of family and friends Elena if you would be so kind as to give your papi another shot.
I believe I owe her a dance.
["De NiÃ±a a Mujer" playing] [laughs] [singing in Spanish] What? Are we not doing that this time? Carry on.
- All right, what's next? - Uh "Kiss AndyÂ GarcÃ­a.
" Well, that might be tough.
Oh, come on! It's a Cuban wedding in LA.
He is here.
I just have to find him.
[DJ] We have a special request.
This goes out to Lydia from her longtime, non-sexual, platonic companion.
The Chicken Dance! A chicken dance? It's on your bouquet list.
You said "master a dance from another culture.
" Oh, you are right.
I swore I would never do this dance, because I have dignity.
But now, I'm an American, so hit it.
["The Chicken Dance" playing] Are you okay? Oh, no, I'm all kinds of messed up.
You? Seeing that father-daughter dance really made me happy, but if one moreÂ person tells me, "You'll find someone," I'm setting off the sprinklers, and we'reÂ gonna see who has extensions real quick.
[sighs] I can't get over Avery.
I had a magical angel woman who wanted a future with me, and I screwed it up.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I'm sorry.
A wedding probably isn't the best place for me right now.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Otherwise, I'd be the only single loser here, so [laughs] - Avery? - [Penelope] Huh? Don't worry.
You'll find someone.
["The Chicken Dance" continues] ["The Chicken Dance" ends] [soft song playing] Oh, thank god! [laughs] Hi.
Hi.
I can't believe you're here.
Wait.
How are you here? Lydia called.
She said you should never give up on an Alvarez.
[chuckles] Apparently, you're an Alvarez now.
She said that? [Avery] Yeah.
That's why I'm here.
She really said that about me being an Alvarez? - Yeah, let's focus on me.
- Right.
Ooh, yeah, nights are so lonely I am so sorry.
And I don't know if there's anything I can say to make up for what I put youÂ through.
How are you doing? Well, 30 days without alcohol was hard.
Thirty-seven days without youwas hell.
I'm so glad you're here.
[laughs] I'm a little scared.
But I'm really glad I'm here too.
I tried to understand the reason why And now I know it's all All because I love you I love you so much Lydia.
I would like you to meet Andy GarcÃ­a.
Leslie, did you really not know who AndyÂ GarcÃ­a is? - Is this the end of our friendship? - No, no, this isÂ AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a.
He is not the star of Geostorm, but he is a podiatrist from Glendale.
Ay, quÃ© sweet! [laughs] The real, handsome, charming AndyÂ GarcÃ­a was not available, so you found me whatever this is.
[DJ] Okay, it's the last song of the night.
So, everybody, find that special someone and get on the dance floor.
[soft song playing] [sighs] Papi, this one hurts.
Papi? Hey, you.
Okay.
Are you really here? Yeah, Victor invited everyone from the unit.
I was late.
I just got off a shift, but I can't believe you're here.
- Kind of a hero.
- Right? Thank you! So, um you want to dance, or you just want to keep poking me? I thought about you a lot this last year.
Me too.
So you seeing anyone? Is he here? I'mover you but also super-jealous.
No, I am not seeing anyone, which has made today extra interesting.
Turns out watching your ex-husband get married is not as fun as it sounds.
[laughs] Yeah, my ex recently married that contractor.
- [clicks tongue] I did not go.
- [laughs] And I may have left a rude comment in the online guestbook.
- Hey, your NP boards are coming up, huh? - Yeah.
Next week.
[sighs] I'm running on no sleep and no confidence.
Oh, please! You're gonna crush it.
I'm not a betting man, but if I had to bet on anyone it'd be you.
Thank you.
[upbeat music playing] Take care of yourself, Max.
You too.
Okay.
I know I sound like a broken record, but that one anda, Lupe, he makes AndyÂ GarcÃ­a look like a podiatrist from Glendale.
[laughs] I know.
He was very much in love with you.
And I was in love with him.
I don't understand.
Don't you want a man who can make you happy? Everyone keeps telling me I'll be happy when I find someone.
But I'm already happy.
And I have no regrets.
So, mi niÃ±a, what is your happy ending? Maybe I'm not meant to have a great love like you and Mami.
Maybe I'll have many.
Maybe I won't.
But if there's one thing that I've learned today, it's that I look damn good in white.
[laughs] I'm so proud to be with you on your special day, Lupita.
Te quiero.
[announcer] Penelope Alvarez.
[all cheer] Dale, Lupita, dale Dale, Lupita, dale [all cheer] Dale, Lupita, dale [inhales] [exhales] [phone rings] Hello? [Lydia] Hello.

How was the flight? How's Miami? [Lydia] I don't know.
What? What do you mean, you don't know? I'm in Cuba.
