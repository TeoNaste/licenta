Your life on Earth has ended, and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe.
Cool.
Oof.
That's how I died? No, sorry, there's more.
[chuckles] I mean, we couldn't believe what we were hearing.
That's him, actually, right up there.
Sure is.
[laughs] Okay, let's take a walk, shall we? Oh, did I have a purse? No, I'm dead, right.
There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.
Yeah.
- And welcome to your first day in the afterlife.
You were all, simply put, good people.
The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived.
And you won't be alone.
[applause] So who is in the Bad Place, that would shock me? Uh, well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basically every artist ever, uh, every U.
S.
Oh, it's perfect, isn't it? You see, in the Good Place, every person gets to live in a home that perfectly matches his or her true essence.
Cool.
This is your Human Rights mission to the Ukraine.
I mean, you got a ton of points for that one.
What about you? Uh, well, I I was born in Phoenix.
- Mm-hmm.
And now I want to say this.
Mm-kay.
" Eleanor, I swear that I will never say or do anything to cause you any harm.
Good.
I mean, somebody royally forked up.
Somebody forked up.
Which one's my desk? So your job was to defraud the elderly? Sorry the sick and elderly? But I was very good at it.
I was the top salesperson five years running.
We'll ask Janet.
Hey, Janet? - Hi there.
That's correct.
Well, that's fine, I wasn't that into him anyway.
I say we just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.
I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you.
Tell Michael about what? Michael? Hi.
What have you been up to? Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Isn't that right, darling? So we'll see you tonight? - Great.
- Yes.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment? Do you have a second to eat my farts? You missed.
[scoffs] Pick it up if you're so horny for the environment.
So we said, "If the U.
N.
But what you don't know is Golly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um, oh, what the heck? This is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.
I had been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project.
- Bravo, Michael, bravo! - Thank you.
Um, and I would just like to quickly say if any of you would like to play tennis tonight, we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts.
"I am just a big, beautiful, utterly perfect cartoon giraffe.
" Oh, okay.
Why aren't there stairs here? [groans] What kind of weirdo house is this? Ooh.
Did you fill your bra with shrimp? No.
It's not, though.
[sighs] Do you think anybody cared that I died? Maybe someone did.
[clears throat] You're a nice person, Chidi Anaconda.
Anagonye.
I didn't change it; it's my name.
Argrugande.
The part when I say I don't want ya I'm stronger than I've been before This is the part When I break free 'Cause I can't resist it no more - Michael.
- Mm? Is that giant, terrifying ladybug supposed to be there? Ah, well, great question, Tahani.
Ah, fork me.
Okay, okay.
So how can we be sure this is my fault? You hogged all the shrimp, and now there are shrimp flying around.
You called Tahani a giraffe, and now there are giraffes everywhere.
Look, apparently it doesn't work that way.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but there's nothing anyone can do.
Let me be your ethical guinea pig.
[knock at door] Hey, guys! Uh, emergency neighborhood meeting, now! We'll be right there, Michael! If I walk out of here in these clothes, I'm toast.
Um, Janet, I need quick question: can anyone access our search history, or is this an incognito browsing situation like when you're stalking a hot male man from your work computer? It is 100% confidential.
No one can access what you ask me, including Michael.
Here.
Yes, thank you, Janet.
Still not used to being in a human body.
And what do you do with sweat? Do do you lick it away, is that right? No, you dab it with a cloth.
Okay, I think it is time to make me good, partner.
How do we do it? Is there a pill I can take or something I could vape? Where did you get a chalkboard? It's the Good Place; you can get anything you want at any time.
Please, help me, man.
I swear I am worth it.
Do you not remember one single thing about me? Dude, things have been nuts around here.
I bet you don't know anything about me.
You are too selfish to ever be a good person.
Well, I think you're wrong.
- Let me see that.
- There's no need.
Flying.
[gasps and warm applause] Now that you're dead, let's live a little, right? Uh, sorry.
We need about, uh, 12 volunteers.
Oh! I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day.
Whoo! [woman laughing] - Hey! - [people chattering] Yeah! Whee! Hey, up there, having fun, or does it maybe suck, probably? I'd say it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms, but better.
How's volunteer garbage pickup? - About the same.
[sniffs] But it's also dead wrong.
This neighborhood is a disaster.
Michael could be heading for a total meltdown.
Soul mate, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Should we say it at the same time? All right.
- Isn't this great? - Um, yeah.
When I thought of the afterlife, I totally pictured being an unpaid, non-flying janitor.
Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt.
Yeah, but what do most great philosophers know? On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at.
Just hit me up when you're done weighing my life in your hands.
I'll just keep doing what I do best: being super considerate and selfless.
Good call.
Guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant loophole in the system I accidentally discovered.
It was my chance to prove myself, and now I've blown it.
You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is.
[gasps] [laughs] It's working! Ow! What the fork? [thunder crashing] Janet, any chance this is a scheduled trash storm? So here's the situation, Pevita.
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.
I'm making things worse.
Okay, all right, that's all right.
- [thunder crashes] - [screams] Oh okay, fine, fine.
My bag broke, and I ditched the trash instead of taking it all the way to the dumpster.
Oh, man.
[laughing] How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar? More cleaning up to do.
I'm a canyon full of poo-poo.
[sobbing] Jianyu, the architect of this neighborhood has just referred to himself as a canyon full of poo-poo.
[laughs] I'm back.
You did it.
Yeah.
No no, I meant I meant I it sucks that I can't do it more often, you know? I actually prefer it to drinking.
If you blow us off, you are banned from Thursday night drinks forever.
Yeah, I'm good with that.
You're doing this because you feel bad.
And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore because I told you that's not gonna happen.
Oh, wow, man, I swear I won't let you down.
Hi there.
Do you know what the best part about this place is? You figured out how to make a to-go cup that doesn't leak right where the seam meets the lid.
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.
You got a long way to go to pull this off.
It will take hours and hours of studying ethics and moral philosophy.
That's not a present; that's just common decency.
Yeah, but I forkin' nailed it.
And groping? [mouths] What? Hello.
Tahani.
[door slams] Ugh.
Tahani.
I'll I'll remind you that you're trying to learn how to be a good person.
Maybe you should return the favor and bring her something.
I'll have what she's having.
It's a work in progress.
You know, do things that you haven't done on earth, right? So why don't we meet tomorrow and try out some new hobbies.
Uh, why not? I'll I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Fresh pears.
It's a plant, just like your gift, but you can actually eat them.
What do you think is causing it? Oh, I'm sure I don't know.
But we must keep our heads up.
She is that kind of person and she did write it.
She wants everybody to think she's such a perfect princess just 'cause she's tall and glamorous and has cappuccino skin and curves everywhere and now I'm complimenting her.
[weeping] Hmm.
Yeah.
And as I raised nearly $60 billion, there was quite a lot of pennies.
[chuckles] But I also dabbled in some other professions.
And "Al-Jamil" means "beautiful," so my full name altogether means "Congratulations, Beautiful.
" Thanks, Eleanor.
Look, a journalist went undercover for an interview and recorded him.
Here, watch.
Honk! I mean, this guy's a monster, we can't support this guy.
Okay, hey, you're not better than me just 'cause you won't support a guy who grabbed a boob once.
Uh, but, uh, exploring makes me nervous.
I have what doctor's call "directional insanity.
I steered her away from colloquialisms and into "fun facts" and trivia tidbits.
I thought it'd be more in her wheelhouse.
Tahani, you're too sweet.
Isn't she just the nicest person? Mm-hmm.
Oh, they look a bit burned.
But they're not.
Yes, I know.
Uh, you never even named your dog, did you? When it ran away, you posted signs saying, "responds to long pauses.
They all truly belong here.
Oh, yes they do, cutie-pants.
This equipment is very scary! Don't be a baby.
It can't hurt you.
Um, but I just want to be an academic.
I want to keep working on my manuscript.
" You're a brilliant guy, Chidi.
But you just kept revising and rewriting and adding words to your title.
[fire crackling] Huh.
What do you think that means? You stole Tahani's diary.
Like with the plant, or when you literally made giant shrimp fly through the air.
I wrote myself the note.
Accept that.
Hey, babe.
Yeah, but shouldn't we just try? Shouldn't we just try to do the right thing whenever we can? Why? It's so much harder to live like that.
And it's not like someone's keeping score.
And also, maybe don't listen to me.
I would love not to listen to you.
Be proud.
I want to broaden my horizons and try new things, and I will.
Okay.
There you go.
I know.
You do.
Oh, thank you.
I really needed to hear that.
How are you, my dear, sweet bestie? Never better.
What's up? Well, Janet has been acting as my assistant.
[giggles] Eleanor, you and I could work side-by-side to figure out what's going wrong with this neighborhood.
Will you help me? - How could I say no? - Yeah, hurrah! - Hurrah! - [giggles] What now? [sighs] Relax, Eleanor.
Michael made a mistake.
But I'm trying, dude.
How have you managed to stay undiscovered? Because I have had to dodge and weave and barely escape with my life, and you don't seem like a super genius.
Hello, Jianyu.
Got to give it up.
Okay, I need to make sure that this isn't some sort of weird trap.
A nurse did that to calm me down once when I crashed my Jet Ski into a manatee.
You crashed your Jet Ski into a manatee? Yeah.
Okay, here's my biggest question: how did you know that I didn't belong here? I figured it out the very first night, at the party, using my powers of deduction.
I heard you don't talk.
You're not supposed to be here.
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
I was done.
Well, good, because of course I will.
[giggles] Tonight, I'm going to select my jauntiest suit, and I may even wear suspenders.
It's one of the human clothing items I'm most eager to try.
Excellent.
So, Tahani has no idea about me? No.
This is my bud-hole.
It's just, like, a hole where me and my buds can hang out.
Is she single, or is she married to Michael? No, no, dude, you cannot date Janet.
A: she's not human.
And it's really hard.
Also, Michael has asked me to be his assistant, whatever that means.
So I'll get right to the point.
I listened to your demo.
That's the dream.
It's your dream, man.
Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked every single detail.
Your restaurant opening is going to be the talk of the entire neighborhood.
It's just that, well, I looked at the guest list earlier, and Jianyu isn't invited.
Right.
Once again, none of these philosophers is ever talking about masturbation.
Let's move on to this week's main event, David Hume's "A Treatise of Human Nature.
That's why I'm doing it.
[distant music thumping] Do you hear music? That's not music.
I swear.
Eleanor, one hour ago, that man was a silent Buddhist monk.
[laughs] Am I going mad, or did I just hear you say, "I'm cool"? Mmm, mm-mm.
I don't think so.
I won't give him a second mouth.
Unless that would be helpful.
Obviously, it's impossible for something to be more perfect than perfect Well, it isn't, actually.
Any place or thing in the universe can be up to 104% perfect.
We just need a plan.
Oh, I got a plan.
Got it? [sighs] - [crowd cheering] - [music stops] Hoo hoo hoo! Oh, another great set, Jason.
They love you, dude.
I'm Mr.
Music, the DJ.
Fun! [laughing] [chatter] It's my Grandmother's maafe.
Fresh perch, slow-roasted in a peanut sauce.
- Hi.
I didn't get a meal.
How's Jianyu doing? Is he opening up? Mm, not yet.
But I can tell he wants to.
I'm sick of pretending to be Jianyu, the tofu man.
I'm gonna tell the story about my real favorite meal.
We need a distraction right the fork now.
No, no, no, no, no.
I know that may not be your number one concern right now, but It was up there.
It's real good soup.
Beautiful, beautiful Jacksonville.
What's wrong, dog? You look like you're freaking out.
I want it all.
That's big goals, man.
The launch was a disaster.
Poor Jianyu was so terrified that I fear he may never speak again.
Michael, I hereby rescind the tendering of my resignation.
We must keep the neighborhood together.
He's just gonna blab and get him and me both sent to The Bad Place.
It's hopeless.
He is putting himself in danger to help us, because he, unlike us, is an amazing person.
I didn't get into heaven to go to school.
Let's get crackin', Teach.
I read this entire David Hume book, and then I read it again because I didn't understand it the first time, and now I'm ready to go.
Cool.
I just have two questions: when are football tryouts? And does this school have a prom? Oh, no.
" Whoa.
It somehow tastes how I felt when my cell phone was fully charged.
I was at the frozen yogurt place and I didn't know what I wanted, so I turned to the guy behind me, and I was like, "Why don't you go ahead?" [gasps] Just like that! "Why don't you go ahead?" O-okay? Dude, you don't understand! I never did stuff like that when I was on Earth.
But now, thanks to your "good person" lessons, I didn't hold up the line.
I ran all the way here and it was so hot.
I mean, I will happily get it, because I told you I would.
It would've broken up my whole break dancing crew and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker.
So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards in Sheila's garage and called the cops.
Oh, you could, um, grade my paper I wrote on the concept of Dharma.
Six pages, and I didn't even do that thing where I try to make it longer by starting every sentence with "Interestingly" Sure, I'll do that and, uh we can start another lesson.
Tahani, dear, could you show us to a private room where no one can see or hear us, even if I yell very loudly out of fear? [device chimes] [gasps] It appears that the sinkhole is not repairing itself.
This is very bad, Janet.
Um, this is the reaction I have when things are incredibly mundane and expected.
I'm gonna leave now at my regular pace, as I do in most scenarios.
What's wrong? Out with it.
I'm just tired, need a break.
Oh, no.
I'm second to last.
It seems you're moving out of your structural period, and more into conceptual abstraction.
Good eye, Mother.
I wake up, there's Eleanor.
I spend all day teaching Eleanor.
As you all may remember, a sinkhole recently opened up in the town center.
The situation, sadly, has worsened.
We only get the welcome channel.
I would love to not watch TV, but you canceled school.
" Get your story straight, bro! [knocking] Hey, guys, it's Michael.
Hi, Michael, what a lovely surprise.
Somewhere in there.
Okay, bye.
2 million isn't bad.
It's very "middle-thermometer.
[applause] I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.
[crowd exclaims] The bidding shall commence at Â£3 million.
You could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.
And I did! [both laughing] It's called, "How to Spot Problems in a Marriage From 100 Miles Away.
It's pssh, snooze, am I right? [both chuckling] They're gonna catch us! This is an extremely precarious situation! I am vexed, Eleanor! A marriage counselor and a human lie detector isn't my first choice for company, either.
But they have no reason to suspect us! Plus, I think they may have actually just come here to, you know, swing.
No, Eleanor, look.
So how much of that did you hear? We couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert in non-verbal communication, and it is clear you are in conflict.
Eleanor, why don't you She never does the dishes.
I have to do them all the time.
It isn't safe to be out of your home.
Please go back inside.
By exactly nine days.
Tahani, this sinkhole is incredibly dangerous.
Okay, Chidi, out with it.
What is so unsatisfying about your soul mate relationship? Be honest, Chidi.
You know, Nina and I are skilled in the art of massage.
Uh, not erotic massage.
Why in the world did you go outside? Because I saw the rankings in the manual.
That manual is only meant to be seen by Architects and Janets.
You've got to be kidding me.
It says, "We bequeath the rest of our estate to Tahini.
[sighs] Oh, I'm sorry that I looked at the rankings, Michael.
But I just don't understand how I'm so low.
- [gasps] - It has? - Could it be - But how Did I? - "Tahani saves the un" - No, no, no.
Still not you.
The real problem is, that the more you help me, the greater the chance is that I can stay here, and me staying here means you'll never get a real soul mate.
- I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.
Go ahead, if you want, just here.
Whoo! See? You can jump up and down on it.
Huh.
How 'bout that? Well, as your assistant, I officially declare this good news.
Much better.
In five minutes, Michael wants my help investigating what's making the neighborhood go nuts, which is obviously me.
Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people are coming up with the rules for a new society.
Like if your Uber driver talks to you, the ride should be free? Sure, but anyone can veto any rule that they think is unfair.
So either I help him find the problem, which is me, and I'm doomed, or I don't help him, and then I'm behaving unethically and the whole world goes crazy and I'm caught anyway.
I need to figure out a way both help him and not help him at the same time.
Top of my game, actually.
Uh, here, let me just, uh Have a seat.
The person who has audibly promised to help you.
So you need to me house-sit the whole week? Sounds like somebody's gonna have a sweet vay-cay.
- Eleanor? - Yeah? This is gonna be a very stressful week for me.
I need to know that I can count on you.
What do you say? - Signs point to yes.
- Oh! Marvelous.
Well, if I feel sympathy for anyone, it's Tahani.
She's going through the same thing I am, but she doesn't know it.
Right? - Made in Taiwan.
- Yes, you were.
We're gonna start with the rocks.
Now, I've investigated all of the rocks in the neighborhood.
Look, I promised to help you, and honestly, the way I can help you is to force you to take a break.
And not working will help me work? Yes! Recharge the old batteries.
And also I will be joining them.
Great, and who is the other half of your couple? Oh, no, no, it's just me.
[robotically] Does not compute.
Does not compute.
[chuckles] That is very human.
Why do you need a human to be your assistant? I mean, aren't there more of whatever you are? Well, since we're becoming friends, like Ross and Phoebe Weird combo to pick, but okay.
And if this neighborhood doesn't work, I am in big trouble.
But more importantly, I promised all of you that you would be safe and happy.
Some time passed, and then it was over.
That's karaoke! Oh, let's do it again.
But it is a time-honored tradition.
Say no more.
We are road-tripping.
Oh, I can't! I promised I'd house-sit one more day, and I have to feed this stupid dog.
I'm ready to be a mom.
[relaxing music playing] I'm having trouble getting this mask to stick.
I had fun, I didn't think about my problems, and I won this ugly yellow toddler, - which is one of the most - beautiful things I've ever seen.
Thank you so much.
And do you like France as much as I do? Well, they enslaved my country for 300 years.
So no.
- We're just, uh - soul friends.
- Oh.
Oh! We need to celebrate! I know, okay Paper clip shower! So do you think we're looking for a man, or do you think we're looking for two men? Not sure.
We don't know anything about this person.
I'll add everybody who flew overhead.
Ugh.
" "Forget about it.
" This is where the sinkhole opened up.
My hoodie, please.
- What's happening? - I give up.
How was I supposed to know he would literally eat all of the food? It shouldn't have been an issue.
You were supposed to be there, but you broke your promise as soon as it wasn't convenient for you, and now I have a very bulbous dog.
I'm right here.
Oh, my gosh.
Of course.
You don't say things, but you do things.
To remember me by.
Thank you all for your patience with the problems in our neighborhood.
The problem is me.
- [all gasp] - And now I have to leave you forever.
I'm truly sorry.
- Janet? - [bell chimes] Please call a train to escort me into retirement.
What did you say to him? Did you make him do this somehow? Nope, this was entirely his idea.
Dude, this is good news.
There's an old Chinese proverb "Lies are like tigers.
They are bad.
Oh, thanks, Henry.
Whoa! New boots.
Those are the coolest boots I've ever seen in my life.
Thanks so much, buddy.
Oh, and here we have a piÃ±ata shaped like you, which is always fun.
By the way, uh, what's you're favorite color for the tablecloths? Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes.
" My soul will be disintegrated, and each molecule will be placed on the surface of a different burning sun.
And then my my essence will be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle and poured over hot diamonds.
The key word for tonight is just "somber.
" Jianyu, my love, we're gonna have to get rid of all of the party poppers immediately.
Can we somehow throw Tahani under the bus? That would be a classic "two birds with one stone" scenario.
Plus, I'd get her house.
I am the only one who can call the train, and it needs me to operate.
Choo-choo.
[sighs] Janet, high five, please? - Thanks, babe.
- [bell chiming] You cannot kill Janet.
Yes, I know.
You've talked about it for the last two days.
- You sit in on my class today? - Uh, I did, yeah.
Great lecture, by the way so bleak.
They're too expensive.
Sure you can.
Michael, as someone who didn't exactly have the steadiest parental guidance, I just want to thank you.
You were always there for us.
Speeches are over.
Michael's going to talk now.
" [chuckles] I wanted to eat a saltine.
Oh! I actually have some saltines.
Each new update of Janet gains more wisdom and social abilities.
Fun fact the first Janet had a click wheel.
Uh, no, that's not what that means at all.
Eleanor? Here we are.
So who's doing this, me or you? [stammers] I think I have to.
Um, being a bystander seems worse, somehow.
[inhales deeply] Eleanor? Eleanor, no, no, no.
Please, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[sighs] That's right, it's not real.
- Let's just do this.
Whoa.
What happened to Janet? She's she's dead.
We have to flee your crime scene.
Run! I have been murdered.
I know what you need.
Janet, can you get Chidi some weed? Oh, that's right.
Hello.
- [screams] - [all gasp] [gasps] Janet, you're alive! Hello, Architect, please enter your four-digit pin.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, her memory must have been wiped clean, so now she's gonna have to re-upload all the knowledge in the universe, which will only take a few days.
You got to admit I kind of nailed it.
All we have to do now is keep the secret forever.
[chuckles] Oh, well actually, um They let you wear your boots in here? They're the only things that bring me comfort.
What did you want to say to me? Oh, um just that I'm here and I love you, man.
Yeah, I know.
And I get it.
Janet, would you please recite the English alphabet? A-B Janet.
She knows her A-B-Janets.
You might be able to shrug this off, and forget about it, but I never will.
[somber music] Hello.
No, you don't.
No, um but please continue.
- Okay, easy.
I assume that this horrifying act is somehow related to the other issues we've had here.
 [melancholy music] [door opens] Eleanor, come on in.
Well, not often you get to confront your greatest failure face-to-face.
Location and date of birth, please.
Phoenix, Arizona, October 14, 1986.
- [tone chimes] Anything else? No, Janet, this is actually a cactus.
This might take a while.
And unless I can figure out a compelling reason to keep you here, you will spend eternity with murderers, and arsonists, and people who take off their shoes and socks on commercial airlines.
Mm, Janet, can I have a glass of water, please? - [tone chimes] - Here you go.
She caused a giant sinkhole into which poor Glenn fell.
She caused a trash storm.
And finally, a multi-part question: Did you ever appear on the American television program "The Bachelor" or its companion shows "The Bachelorette" and "Bachelor in Paradise," or post on any social media site that you were emotionally invested in any of the relationships the contestants were pursuing? No.
Okay.
I have Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
I do not have a cactus.
There's no such thing as a mistake in this realm.
And yet, you are, somehow, a mistake.
We've never really had a call for it before you, but in the interest of time.
Eleanor, did you murder Janet? No, I did not.
I'm amazing.
Bad news.
Yeah, I know we're in a miserable bind here, but this might be the proudest day of my life.
No offense, but that's a real bummer of a life.
You've been a big help.
[low tone] Listen up, genius.
I seek your wisdom in this moment of crisis.
What to do with Eleanor? Should I let her stay? Should I send her away? You think I should send her away? No, I should let her stay? Or no, I shouldn't let her stay because she doesn't belong here? Or no, I shouldn't let her stay even though she does belong here? Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom.
Oh, thank you, Jianyu.
You're free to go.
Eleanor, come back in.
Chidi, you stay here.
They came with unlimited ranch dressing.
Let's hear about the t-shirts, please.
All right, I gotta go to the DMV and pick up my vanity plates.
Ciao, bitches.
The legal fees drove the dry cleaner out of business.
Oh, boy.
She totally overreacted.
This is her fault.
No.
Do not tell me that you made t-shirts that said that and then sold them for a profit? Wish I could tell you that, bud.
Does it help if they basically sold themselves? I think you know it does not.
What did you do with the money? Gah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.
Come and get her.
[dramatic music] [dramatic Western music] What is this? What is that smell? Get out of here! Hello, Trevor.
You're Check this out.
- Huh? - All: "Dress Bitch"! It's pretty great, right? - Trevor - [laughs] Do you know what caused this mistake? 'Cause I cannot figure it out.
We gotta get back for "The Bachelor.
" I'm gonna be pissed if I miss the Rose Ceremony.
Just know you did everything you could to help me.
You're a really good fake soul mate.
Oh, hey, dum-dum.
You ready to go? Oh, you must be Chidi.
[dramatic music] This is the 3:18 to the Bad Place, making thousands of stops for literally no reason.
Now, you'll notice it's very hot in here, and it will get one degree hotter every time you think about how hot it is.
Eleanor is learning.
She's just doing it after she died.
Not with her.
Not yet.
What? I'm sorry - The other Eleanor? - Yeah, the real Eleanor.
The one that was supposed to be here but got sent down to us instead? She's on the train.
The "real Eleanor" was attending a conference on the death penalty, and you stopped by to pick up food for a local homeless shelter.
And "fake Eleanor" was there buying margarita mix and a magazine called "Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters.
The trash bag is ours - So, trash bag, let's go.
- Wh Let's hit it.
Fake Eleanor, a word? It's just me, man.
You can just say, "Eleanor.
Cool.
Well, welcome to Adobe High, home of the Scorpi-oties! Half the school wanted to be the Scorpions, half wanted to be the Coyotes, so we compromised.
I get your whole "mean girl" thing, and I'm all set with it, thanks.
In fact Listen up, everyone.
And anyway, there's a bigger problem: the Bad Place Crew they're all terrible bullies, and they outnumber me.
They even have their own Bad Janet.
I'll be right back.
Well, here's your house.
And if I didn't remember everyone's name, I got a very strong electric shock.
Yep, that was my pitch.
I don't mean to be a bother, but could I possibly get some water and whatever food doesn't turn to spiders in your mouth? Oh, of course, so sorry.
Let's get some dinner.
Yo, Good Janet.
- [beep] - Hi, there.
"I got to admit that does sound like me.
" - Oh, nailed it again.
Oh, and I think your grilled eggplant looks so good.
Should we - [together] Splitsies? - Yeah! [laughs] I can't believe you thought you could pretend to be Real Eleanor.
Oh, actually, um, I I'm not sure.
I never met my birth parents.
Am I right, Fake Eleanor? Please, stop calling me that.
Oh, you got it, third wheel.
Thanks, Jianyu.
I mean, it does matter if I know things, because I'm an informational delivery system, and I don't have a heart, but thanks.
[light music] Why did you do that? Because you're the only person here that's nice to me.
Okay.
Yeah, actually, we've had some interesting and in-depth classes.
He taught me about Plato - and Socrates, Immanuel Kant - Yeah, cool, shut up.
- [laughs] Well, please, show me everything.
You ready, Eleanor? I've seen it all already.
Cool, okay, well, I'll get tickets for the eight of us, and you can just pay me back in cash.
So you can get all the points on your credit card, and the rest of us get screwed? - No way.
Don't Don't All right.
Ha.
Oh, I think I made it pretty clear that I don't approve.
Hey, idiot.
But I read your file You don't belong here.
I mean, she spent her weekends breaking up dog fighting rings.
Oh, Tahani, I'm so sorry.
I will obviously clean all of this up.
You are smart, you are capable, and the time has come to hit "unfriend.
" I also told Mark to lose the "the".
We'll walk over together? You don't have to come, man.
I'm good.
Uh, I'm good.
You're turning it down? I just don't think I'm really one of you guys.
Good looking out, boss.
Peace! You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake allergy medicine.
Happy to be a part of the not-team.
It'll be a pleasure not hanging out with you.
Let's go, dingdong.
Come on.
Thanks, Real Eleanor.
Hey, if you two aren't gonna make out, just shut up.
If I'm wrong, you can take her to the Bad Place and punish her all you want, just really go to town on her.
Gah, gah, gah, easy, buddy, easy.
[Tahani claps] Hello, Jianyu.
You got sloppy.
What are you talking about? I'm ranking my favorite "Fast and the Furious" movies.
You said you wanted to know who I am, and this is the best way to get to know me.
You know what? It'd be one thing if you just weren't a Buddhist monk, but you're barely even a regular, functioning person.
How did you get here? I don't know, but, please, dawg, you can't tell Michael about me.
Regretted it immediately.
Bambadjan was a human rights advocate, so he and Real Eleanor will build a sort of legal argument.
[as Chidi] Oh, Eleanor, I have a stomachache because of what you did.
[laughs] He is such a dork.
Nobody asked you, Bambadjan.
I'm not sure what will work with Shawn, but we should have all our bases covered.
Let's let's start small.
Do you want to use a dry erase board or the regular pen and paper? Just pick.
You can't draft the teacher.
Pick a kid.
And he only stopped because he saw me timing him.
Granted, he laughed, and kind of made fun of himself, it was a nice moment, but still.
You didn't paint this.
You got Janet to do it.
This guy's famous.
I mean, who even are those ladies? Yeah, it would be easier to sort out the issue of dry erase versus paper if I could write down the pros and cons for each, but, of course, I would have to use one of them to write down the pros and cons for them, which is problematic.
Usually wouldn't even call or anything.
I'd just bounce.
Yeah, I love you.
Ugh, that's embarrassing.
Jianyu's a fake.
He's not supposed to be here.
Can I get a do-over? [light music] I need to step outside for some air, and I will not be back for many days.
Dude, you can't just run away.
- Hey, Janet? - [beep] Hi, there.
What are you watching? My greatest accomplishment ever.
Why are you so nice to me? Well, you were very nice to me while I was rebooting.
Also, I'm programmed to be nice to everyone.
Maybe if you lose.
If he doesn't pick me, I'ma start throwing stuff.
Listen, you and I have a weird, complicated, forked-up friendship, but it's our friendship, and I care about it.
Let's do something fun.
Okay, we did your thing.
Now it's my turn.
Right, it's one of those two people.
Well, I d I don't know.
Yeah, you know, maybe that's smart.
[laughs] How are you? Uzo, it's been too long.
Um, excuse me, excuse me.
I have decided I would like to unequivocally order the pumpkin soup.
Ugh, the dream.
And how exactly did you learn how to do this? When I was 14, I had to make myself look older to get a job.
We both love to dance, we were both banned from public transit systems in our cities.
I think this is the answer.
The answer is Real Eleanor.
- How do you know? - I don't, but the minute I said that, you knew instinctively whether it felt right.
Oh, boy, I mean, these run about 55 minutes a piece.
I'm really hot.
Yeah, here's the thing, bud: my wedding isn't for another month.
This was a test to see if you could handle being my best man, and, just as I predicted, you failed, miserably.
You're incapable of making a single decision.
Look, I know I can be indecisive, but what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes to find the perfect [clang] [dramatic music] Chidi? You're right.
It is a bit strange.
I'd like to read a poem.
- I want you to be my husband.
- Tight.
'Course, hot stuff.
I got your back.
An hour ago, I thought Jianyu was my soul mate, and the fact that that kind of made sense means you and I could never be meant for each other.
Plus, Jianyu's married to Janet now.
What? Oh, we would love to stay and chat, but we need to find Michael.
Eleanor, I think I figured out a way for you to stay.
We will apply the formula to Eleanor's actions here in the Good Place, and if you earn enough new points, then we could argue that you should stay here.
- Would that work? - Don't know, never had to prove someone belonged here before.
Wal mart? It's a place regular people go.
- You haven't heard of it.
Eleanor, everyone hates you.
Well, fork you too.
Oh, no, no, Chidi, that that's me saying that to you.
I love you.
I'm sorry, I've never kissed anyone before.
Is one tongue okay? I can add more tongues.
We gotta go public.
I hate all this hiding.
I know what we gotta do.
We're gonna rob this restaurant.
Think of this as an open forum for you to air any and all grievances that you may carry against her.
I was flying on the second day, and when you caused the trash storm, I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass, and it exploded.
It seems everyone's problem with me is me.
Yes, it would appear that way.
I'm married.
- To whom? - Sorry, my protocol forbids me from telling you any private information about any resident.
She makes the bass drop in my heart.
And Jason is a person who was near me, and then he asked me to marry him, and there is nothing in my protocol that specifically barred that from happening.
I also learned how to do this.
I will speak to you later.
- I love you.
I love you too.
You have a tendency to over-think things.
Turn off that giant brain, and just say you love her too.
I think I figured this out.
There is a real Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who took an oath of silence at the age of eight.
[ding] Did you ever have a personalized license plate? Yeah, dawg.
- "I LUV BUTTS".
I promise.
[light music] I don't know, B.
J, they're on to us, man.
His hat's a golf ball, and he's a got a terrible mustache.
Please, they'll listen to you.
Just pay me a few compliments.
Now, we shall hear from tonight's featured guest.
She's kind, she's humble, she's the Walmart of friends.
Like "nobody's perfect," but the letters switched.
- That's very funny.
- My motivation is corrupt.
Even when I do nice things, I'm only doing them so I can get something out of it, the ability to stay here, which means none of this had any real moral value.
Where you been? Oh, just walking around, contemplating my failure, wishing for the sweet release of eternal extinction.
Cool.
He pops out, steals the money from the restaurant, gets back in the safe, then you come in and uninstall it.
I refuse to discuss my fifth amendment rights until I concur with your attorney.
There were no air holes.
Plus he did a bunch of whippits while he was in there, which couldn't have helped.
I mean, what a family.
I'm just a dope who died in a safe with a snorkel who's only now realizing why that didn't work.
This is bonkers.
Okay, I have to go reboot Janet.
I'm not starting over.
What if he reboots me, and we fall out of love? We have to get out of here right now.
I was just about to call you to ask you to get me a train to the Bad Place.
- Whoa, what? - You have to be a good person to stay here, and I can't become a good person unless I leave.
Let's go hang with Mindy.
That sounds great.
Ooh.
- Michael.
I truly believe she's a good person.
- [train chugging] - Are you sure? Because I believe she's stealing my train.
21.
So, big plans this weekend? Yep.
You don't exist.
You're bothering me.
We're going somewhere that's not the Good Place, and it's not the Bad Place.
We're going to a Medium Place.
Oh, yeah? What things did he say were sexy? Lamborghinis, cool snakes, spinning rims, 20,000 followers on Instagram, girls with pigtails eating lollipops, latex pants, Carl's Jr.
ads, and sex.
What I will consider is the recent development - of Eleanor stealing my train.
- Now, hold on a second.
Clair live? I don't know.
I'm out of range of our neighborhood.
Hello, Mindy.
My name is Beadie.
You submitted a list of things you wanted; the Good Place provided those things.
Yeah, and the Bad Place made some modifications.
- Welcome to the Medium Place.
- So what's up? What's your deal? Are you single? - What's going on? - [static crackles] Sorry about before.
You guys have fun.
This is me and Janet's honeymoon, so we're gonna go try and figure out how to have sex.
- Good for you! And then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.
- Ooh - Honestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna kill me [chuckles] 'Cause I love cocaine.
I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time.
[chuckles] Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.
Oh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we Yeah, no, I get it.
Eleanor was supposed to be in the Bad Place, arrived here by accident, assumed another person's identity, and has now escaped.
Is that the whole story? Well, no.
I was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.
[deadpan] Eleanor is a magnificent person who has grown tremendously in her time here.
Her memories? As in, all the things - she's done on Earth? - Mm-hmm.
But perhaps we could take a little break first.
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography.
My friend in the Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics.
Yeah.
Hey, you two lovebirds figure out how to have sex yet? No.
We need to do something quickly.
Yeah, uh, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally? Ugh.
And it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement.
I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did.
[clears throat] Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.
The progress she has made does not offset her actions on Earth.
We do not know where you are but hope you are receiving this message.
You have been found to be the rightful property of the Bad Place.
We don't have to go back, though.
- they just said.
Or you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.
[slow motion] Bortles! [dramatic music] No! [clink] What are you doing, you goon? Trying to blow up the train.
Blowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged a ride-or-die protocol so I'm loyal to Jason forever.
Buddy Come on, we gotta go.
Me and Janet keep trying to solve the problem of how to have sex, which could take years.
Yeah, yeah.
You scored free WrestleMania tickets? There are no tickets, Mom.
I knew that was the only way I could get you here.
I just need you to sign it.
Emancipation papers? Honey! What does "emancipation" mean? It means I'll be on my own.
Well, if you want me to sign oh, that's a joint.
Uh, do you have a pen or a lighter? You're a really interesting person, Eleanor.
In preparation for your trip to the Bad Place, please put on these fedoras.
Oh, no.
But we're here.
We came here as fast as we could, and we're here.
You can decide.
You have 30 minutes.
Ugh.
Listen, we got the files for the new crop of incoming, and the Big Guy thinks it's time for you to fly solo.
This is your shot.
Good luck.
Okay, I thought you were gonna at least pretend to fight me on that, but whatever.
Hang on.
Chidi's done worse stuff than me.
He murdered Janet.
Well, I'm in love with this Janet.
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff which almost turned out to be sex, and we were married in a legal ceremony.
Well, I did a good job.
You mostly fell asleep in class or made fart noises with your hands.
Yes.
But no.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to contribute to your misery, it's just that I'm frightened.
I don't have an actual soul mate.
I will not.
It is literally impossible for me to do that.
Good-bye forever.
I will miss you so much.
I've been there, I know I can hack it.
Actually, I have kind of a rapport with some of the fire monsters.
Well reasoned.
Wow, Chidi is a terrible writer.
Working on your first solo design, right? How's it coming? Do you ever get the feeling we could be doing it all differently? I mean, it's always the same.
We get the names, come up with the design, they arrive, we move on to the next one.
I am.
- What? - Why? Real Eleanor is my soul mate or was my soul mate and she's only going down there because she thinks that I don't love her.
End of everything.
What? Now you're trying to replace Chidi? No.
- Hey, that's racist! - Not a robot.
Oh, you have some nerve.
Well, what about Real Eleanor? No, it's me and Chidi.
Call the train.
Oh, okay.
[chuckles] [door closes] Ready when you are, boss.
So she's right? Yeah, she figured it out.
No, this doesn't make any sense.
He convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.
He made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.
They figured it out.
- They - They know this is the Bad Place.
Four people, perfectly suited to make each other miserable.
I'm going to design an afterlife where they torture each other.
Let's try something new.
Too many variables.
How would this work, exactly? Oh.
Yes, all right, so [clears throat] This is a 14 million-point plan.
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice vacation from your full-time job.
Get your story straight.
Hey, guys? It's Michael! [groans] That was really a fun time.
Then it all started to go off the rails.
No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe for all of the neighborhoods, good and bad.
And apparently, this Janet is in love with Jason.
Which I did.
Couple of times, actually.
You were just the closest.
That makes me feel worse, somehow.
But that's for another time.
You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.
Just gotta get the boss man to sign off.
Wish me luck.
Look, for a first attempt it was actually very promising.
Let me let me just tinker a little, try again.
We figured it out once, we can do it again, because you know what, Michael? Ya bas [chimes tinkle] [door opening] Eleanor, come on in.
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Really? [laughs] Chris, you'll stand by me no matter what, right? Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out? I love working out.
After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth.
What? [dramatic music] What the fork is a "Chidi"? Why can't I say "fork"?
Hi there.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment? No.
- See? - Why are you like this? Excuse me? Why am I like this? You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.
- Go away from me.
- Okay.
I'm here to preside over case #00003 regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.
The Bad Place has sent Bad Janet to present their argument.
She was sacrificing herself because she is a wonderful, selfless - [crunching] - No, don't oh! - What's happening? - I should have warned you.
Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.
- Perfect.
[sighs] Well, let's try this way.
- What's up, idiot? Sorry I'm late, babe.
Hey, are you pregnant? - That's not possible.
Yeah, but it's always warm.
On your jukebox, you'll find every song ever sung.
[laughs] My kind of gal.
And I gotta say, you keep it tight.
I only cared about making money and doing cocaine.
One night, I had an epiphany, right? I needed to do something good with my life.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, I was just I was just kidding.
I was about to turn myself in.
No.
Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now.
No, thanks.
His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe he's on the train with Eleanor.
- You knew about Jason? - Yes, I know that he's a fake and that he's married to Janet and that this entire neighborhood is What's the human expression? Ah, yes, a smokin' hot turd.
[deadpan] Voluntarily heading to the Bad Place proves that she is a selfless person.
Sorry.
I've been asleep in goo for the last 29 years, so I'm good.
Call up the screen for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.
Look, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind.
Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can.
It was weird.
[speaking Spanish] [air horn blares] This ain't your bar mitzvah anymore, bitch.
Dramamine.
Helps with the nausea.
I, too, helped Eleanor.
Not as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice.
- Oh! - As concerning Jason Mendoza, I have heard no statements nor seen any evidence to suggest oh, he's from Florida? Yeah, he belongs in the Bad Place.
No, but how do you intend to enforce this ruling? You have no idea where they are.
- What? - What? You have four hours.
Good-bye.
They're our friends.
- We literally owe it to them.
- That's their problem.
Your problem is whether you get tortured.
Do do you have another bottle? Hi there, since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat.
- Ah, kind of like a last meal.
It's scary, like the movie "Ratatouille.
" - What? - Yo, I ain't trying to have rats living in my hat and pulling my hair to get me to do stuff.
No, it's time to own up, dude.
I spent my whole life acting like Mindy, me first, no matter what, and it literally took dying and being around a bunch of good people to realize that I was kind of a nightmare.
Eleanor, just because your father and I are divorced does not mean you can disrespect me like this, okay? We are a family.
Whose birthday is it? - Mine.
I work two after-school jobs because you blew half my college fund bailing your boyfriend out of jail.
So irresponsible.
[melancholy music] Wow, your parents sucked.
Yeah, they did, and I've been using their crappy parenting as an excuse for my selfish behavior all my life.
We surrender.
Together.
I established a deadline.
The deadline was missed.
I am in charge of all matters here for the next 30 minutes.
Bring me a list of the frozen yogurt flavors.
You're ready.
Oh, Dave, I'm gonna work so hard.
Somehow I blew it and well, you're all suffering, and for that, I'm deeply sorry.
This is truly the saddest day of my life.
Let's look at this ethnically.
For what I hope is the last time, it is "ethically.
He who smelt it murdered Janet.
Okay, well, it's settled then.
Okay, J-bones, you and me, outside.
What? But I'm not going.
This place truly is paradise.
- Look at them.
My brain will break.
I'm sorry, it's just that I have certain feelings for you.
Jason has agreed that the two of us should go.
- Bye, Tahani.
Sorry, that's how I ended most of my serious relationships.
Yeah, that checks out.
[both sniffling] All right, ready to go? Let's grab Michael.
[knocking at the door] Come in.
You belong here.
There's another reason.
Wouldn't be surprised if retirement were on the table.
Retirement? Course, what do I know? I'm just The All-Knowing Judge of All Matters in the Afterlife.
Yeah, I guess, but don't rock the boat here, pal, just try to do a good job.
[playful music] Mm.
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.
Chidi and I are going to go together, which means that you and Real Eleanor and Jason can stay.
Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it! Look, I love you and I think you love me.
What? Oh, man.
Wow! [laughing] Okay, okay.
I don't accept this offer.
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.
" And then it hit me.
They're never gonna call a train to take us to the Bad Place.
Oh, it looks like paradise, but it's actually a filthy dumpster full of our worst anxieties.
I'm surrounded by people who are literally better than me.
He played us like a fiddle.
You gotta give it up.
[groans] Man! This was supposed to be my big moment.
I just rehearsed that speech for, like, three hours.
Humans are very reticent to torture each other.
Even getting them to do simple things like pulling out each other's teeth is like I can't think of the right analogy.
That's what will make it fun.
I cannot predict everything that's gonna happen, but we'll improvise.
I thought we reserved the conference room.
No, Todd, we have it until 3:00.
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.
You had no idea I was gonna do that, because honestly, I had no idea I was gonna do that, Yeah, that came out of nowhere.
I mean, after that it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.
I know why Jason and I were sent here, but why Tahani? Oh, yeah.
Didn't you raise, like, $1,000 for charity, or whatever? Uh, $60 billion, actually, so.
I read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use - almond milk in my coffee - No, dingus! You hurt everyone in your life with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.
[playful music] Oh, fork! You're right.
Thank you, Chidi.
I really needed to hear that right now.
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.
Oh, Eleanor.
Quick.
Tahani, anything? Chidi, I need ya.
But you're way out on a limb here, Mike.
If this thing goes sideways again, you are done.
[upbeat music] You know the way you feel when you see a chimpanzee and a baby tiger who've become friends? [laughter] That's how you're going to feel every day.
Your medical relief mission to Kazakhstan, that really put you over the top, you got a ton of points for that.
Yeah, you gotta.
Once I'm back, we'll get to know each other.
You're in the Good Place.
- [sighs in relief] - Eleanor, you are my soul mate.
- [all gasping] - You have all done bad things since you arrived here.
The Bad Place is owed two people.
Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
I'm gonna erase your memories, make a few changes, and start over again.
You'll stand by me no matter what, right? Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out? I gotta stay jacked.
Project confidence.
There he is! How's it going, boss-man? Enough chit-chat.
I think this entire project of yours is stupid and doomed to fail.
I think you're going to be retired, eliminated from existence and burned on the surface of a billion suns.
That's an expression, Chuck.
All right, go ahead, Vicky.
I know that this kind of large-scale deception is not what you were trained to do.
There are gonna be days when you're just sick of being around these disgusting humans, with their weird, gross little mouths, and their stupid elbows.
Okay, Chidi, where are you? Or what are you? A type of soup, maybe? Hi there.
I'm Eleanor.
Duh! [laughs] There's no use for 'em.
I always prefer talking to people anyway.
Chidi? Are you Chidi? [otherworldly ringing music] Eleanor? What are you up to? Oh, hey there, Michael.
Just getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.
And as such, I was just hoping that you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party.
You know, just to introduce yourself.
Can I tell you something, - just soul-mate to soul-mate? - Hold that thought.
- I'm gonna head to the gym.
Me.
Neither.
I know.
Just don't ask me any questions about it.
[sighs] Ah, screw it.
Couple of quick shots [gasps softly] And then I'm coming for you, shrimpies.
[rushing sound] [door clicks open] Chidi? Come on in.
So there really is an afterlife.
But the point is: Chidi, you were way better than all of them.
You're safe.
But in your case, the system matched you with two other people.
It's a rare occurrence, like like a double rainbow, or someone on the Internet saying, "You know what? You've convinced me I was wrong.
- Um, so, so, so - Yeah? Yeah, so making decisions isn't necessarily - my strong suit.
- I know that, buddy.
A- Right.
Um You ready, Chidi? Here you go, Chidi.
Kind of makes you wonder what type of pizza they have in the Bad Place, huh? [both laughing] So, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane.
We must have just missed each other.
Just amazing people.
I'm surrounded.
[chuckles] - [laughs] - [laughs] [both laughing] [scattered, fading chuckles] Okay.
All right.
Do you look bad? No.
But good? Would I go as far as to say that you look good? Doubtful.
Hey.
How are you doing? Oh, well, uh [laughs] You know.
- Well, I know, but if the numbers were that close, AngÃ©lique, I think I'm supposed to Stop! Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.
[bright string music] These are for you.
I'm right in the middle of something.
Dude, I'm guessing we have about 30 seconds to talk before someone notices.
And that's your name, right? So, for some reason, at some point, I put this note into that whatever-lady's robot mouth.
- You already forgot her name? - No, I didn't.
Attention, everyone! [glass ringing] Speech time! I know you're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet, but if you are, please get me out of this speech.
[rushing sound] [door clicks open] Tahani.
I'm sorry, did I just say "short"? I-I meant to say "charmed, I'm sure," of course, because I am charmed to meet you, it's just an unfortunate Freudian short.
[giggles] Shall we? So, where did you attend medical short? So, this is the living room as well as the kitchen and the bedroom.
[magical ringing] Okay, I'll let you two have some alone time.
I will see you at the party.
Well, I best be getting changed for tonight.
- Mm.
Is that what you call a female plumber, or is it a toilet sweep? Or clog wench? [laughing sadly] In any case, that's how I'm dressed.
My darling, you are in the Good Place.
Really? Like what? [sighing] Well, my house is a bit small, which is fine, it's just not what I'm used to, and TomÃ¡s is lovely, but we haven't really "clicked" yet, to use a mundane colloquialism which I suppose I should do, now that I'm wearing [voice breaking] Cargo pants.
Tahani, it's very common to experience adjustment pains.
So no, no changes needed.
Okay, all right.
Oh no, no, I [laughing] Hey! Twinsies! - I'm sorry? - Look! Cargo-pants buddies! [chortles] I bet we have a lot in common.
I was a garbage man in Winnipeg.
Oh, no offense, darling, wherever you are.
Probably somewhere down there.
Look at that terrible placement and angle.
Is this your first time ever wearing a sash? Yeah, it is, but I think if we all just Well give it to me then! [shouts] [guests gasping] I got her off the stage.
You and Luang share an identical soul like binary stars, orbiting one another in a perfect, reflective harmony.
You won't ever have a single moment of loneliness, because you'll always be right next to each other for eternity.
Can I offer you two something to drink? - Janet! - Hi there.
This is Janet.
Never better.
Top of my game, actually.
How can I say no? [laughs] So cozy.
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.
I took this job because it seemed fun and different, and in the original version, I got to break Chidi's heart, like, 20 times, and it was great.
I mean, he was miserable.
- This is supposed to be the Good Place.
Why would Okay, I no, I hear you.
[glass ringing] Speech time! We're all good people, right? We all did the right thing whenever we could.
- If we all just - Well give it to me! [shouts] [guests gasping] Tahani? Are you all right? Yes, fine.
- All right, brag much? - No, I'm trying to help you.
- Sorry.
Tahani gave the drunken speech instead of Eleanor.
We can't build a chaos sequence out of Tahani's speech, because she thinks she belongs here ding-dong.
- What's up, guys? - What are you doing here? - Why aren't you with Eleanor? - Oh, I told her I was going to the gym again.
Why would you say that in the middle of a party? - You told me too.
I'm going to the gym! Fine.
Yeah, you do that.
I spent my life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the uni [gasps] Oh, no! I used almond milk in my coffee, even though I knew about the negative environmental impact.
- What? - Eleanor, what do we do? I don't know, dude! But we better figure it out soon, or we're doomed.
- Oh, yeah, "yurt" for short.
I was psyched to meet my new best friend, but he turned out to be this weird silent guy that won't leave me alone.
- Why did you do that? - Because you were nice to me.
- You're my friend.
- The first night in the afterlife can be a little overwhelming.
Don't worry about us, Michael.
That's okay.
You can just keep it.
There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.
Bye! - [short beep] [whispering] This is the wise monk who gave me the magic amulet.
I gotta figure out what it means.
Babe, there you are.
I've been worried Let me stop you.
Except according to this note, it's a prank show we've all been on before.
- What note? - Apparently, I wrote myself a note, and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth.
And to be honest I'm relieved.
At least there's an explanation for why this all went south so fast.
Well, as humans like to say, third time's the charm, right? [employees grumbling] I take full responsibility for the false start.
But I assure you all, there is no note this time.
- Questions.
- Maybe it's none of our business, but did you tell Shawn - what happened? - Yes, I did.
Eleanor got completely drunk last night.
She talked for, like, an hour.
And remember, there will be no attempt number three.
[digital beeping] [tense string music] Eleanor.
Cool.
I'm Chris Baker.
Gah! Oh, boy.
Hey, robot slave lady? Busty Alexa? - Oh, Janet? - Hi, there.
Apparently, the Bad Place knows that one of you actually belongs down there with them, and they want that person to get inside the obelisk, or they're gonna take all of you.
I can't go.
I'll go.
I deserve to go.
Ahh, farts.
Okay, attempt number 11.
Anybody else you got to teach me? You guys ready for our lesson? We're talking David Hume today, bundle theory of the self, baby.
Sounds like a real banger, but you guys gotta scram.
That was a real trip for biscuits, and now we're all wet, Daddy-O.
I never even got to play my stupid triangle.
Michael, you monster! Attempt 32.
Attempt 57.
This is your soul mate Greg.
This is your soul mate Glenn.
This is the Bad Place.
The pig's getting angry.
No, no, no! No, Michael! Please, please, calm down.
Calm down.
I just keep lying to him, and it's really bad, but I I mean, I have to keep trying.
I'm in too deep.
This guy sucks.
Who else you got? I can hear you.
Ow.
Okay, this might be the one.
I speak for the entire crew, Michael.
We're sick of it.
And you're gonna do 'em.
So Aristotle believes your character is voluntary, because, uh are you ignoring me right now? It's day two of our ethics lessons, and you're already tuning out? No, sorry, I just got distracted for a second.
You know, you guys aren't supposed to be smoking.
You're supposed to keep your human suit on.
This is the Bad Place.
I forking knew it! And clam chowder is disgusting.
- How can I help you? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How do we know she's not a part of it? We don't, but we gotta risk it.
Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either, bud.
I always assumed the afterlife was full of cool people, not talking sweater vests.
You've been here 15 times already.
What? Did you bring the cocaine I asked for? Please tell me you somehow remembered this time.
You can't even pull off those bow ties.
That was very mean, but I'm gonna move past that in the name of unit cohesion.
Down under.
Is it always the three of us? It's always at least Eleanor and Janet.
You always say that.
And you always end up going back.
"Make Michael think he's the one in the Bad Place.
Catch that magic panda.
What? I know it says here that we already tried throwing Tahani under the bus, but maybe we should revisit that.
Throw her a little bit harder.
You you are so mean, Eleanor.
You're just like those childhood bullies who said I would never get tenure.
I have listened to you talk about Chidi 15 times in 15 different ways.
Let me just cut to the chase.
And you don't need to respond 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel I love you too.
Very funny, but that that's obviously not real.
It, like, really killed the vibe for me.
See, after I watch the porno I made starring you, I watch you talk about your feelings to cool down.
No, Eleanor.
You guys have known each other a really long time.
What are my options? Do I have any? I mean, I can't go along with her plan.
It'll be a spectacular failure.
" That night, as the clock struck 12:00, me and my crew came together with a determination we had never shown before and slashed all their tires.
It was dope.
No, stop, no more lies.
Jason, get over here.
- What? - I want to team up with you guys.
What? Why? You do? What? I'm in a bit of a bind, and I could use some backup, or as Jason put it, um, I need a new dance crew.
The point is that circumstances have changed.
And now, all of us teaming up is our best option.
Look, I built this neighborhood as a way to torture the four of you psychologically for thousands of years.
And you keep figuring it out and taking all the fun out of it.
Ugh! How did we ever think this was the Good Place? Vicky thinks that she can run this neighborhood better than I can.
And she wants to start her version in 30 minutes.
My boss gave me two chances to make this work.
Suffice to say, I tried more than two times.
- Let me help you.
- [bell dings] [shimmering tone] Son of a bench.
I always trust dudes in bow ties.
Once, this guy in a bow tie came up to me at the gun range in a Jacksonville bus station and said he'd give me $600 if I put these weird turtles in my duffle bag and brought them to Daytona Beach.
- I agree.
He could be lying about this whole thing.
First off, how can we possibly trust you? You can't.
But you have to.
Uh, no.
Will they ever win the Super Bowl? Jason, I can't predict the future.
Boy, you guys barely know each other.
It's gonna make this tough.
There has to be a Janet in every neighborhood, good and bad.
This one is an actual Good Place Janet that I stole to help sell the ruse.
I was talking about my testicles.
Mindy St.
- Seriously?! How are she and I in the same place? - Oh, get over yourself.
- Trust me, don't trust me, it doesn't matter.
- Then you better get cracking on a new plan, pally, because so far, I haven't heard a single good reason why I should help you.
All right, how about this? You help me trick Vicky and all those other goons, I can get you to the real Good Place.
Please, sir, take pity on me, I've changed and all that crap, maybe I can earn a spot, too.
We didn't deserve the Good Place based on our time on Earth.
Are you forking kidding me right now? You take a half an hour to pick out a turtleneck, and yet this you're sure about? Okay, look, I spent my whole life trying to learn about right and wrong and apparently, I failed.
I want us to get better and I want us to stay that way.
So I think I'm gonna fast forward things a bit.
There's a very good reason why you ended up here.
But it might help you come to grips with who you really were.
Do you want to remember it? Tahani Al-Jamil, social activist, philanthropist, neck model and now cover girl for "International Sophisticate Magazine.
Remarkable.
Is there a question? Don't you find that remarkable? Kamilah is very impressive.
You have all the attention.
Once again.
[laughs] No! Ow.
Thing just ah! I'll bring you down! I will bring you down.
- Oh, come on, now.
It's not all bad.
Yet again, it's everyone against Eleanor.
Because everyone except Eleanor is an idiot.
- That's funny.
- We're cockroaches to you? Yeah.
So whatever Michael's reasons for doing this, he's giving us the best chance to improve ourselves.
Okay, I have to admit, you're making a lot of sense right now.
- Gonna bail, huh? - Hm? No.
Why why would you say that? Well, you got a bag full of clothes, you stuffed a bunch of pillows and a mop in your bed to make it look like you're asleep and you're literally sneaking out the back gate.
And who cares that it's only been a week? How long do you have to know someone before you - do the right thing? - Nine weeks, minimum.
- Okay.
We're not in a hurry or anything.
How many times in all the reboots did I ask Chidi for help, he refused to help me and then I had to get better on my own? Never.
Stuck with you and always helped you overcome your biggest problem.
Assuming that's my selfishness.
I think Michael is a liar.
I think there's a 99% chance he's forking with us.
We'll help you.
You finally listened to reason.
And who am I? Describe me now.
We are all going to take classes.
- I've only given this opening day tour to you like, 800 times.
Hey, how's this for my oh-my-God-I'm-in-Heaven face? - Not bad.
I got her to tell me how she was gonna torture you at the party, which is basically the same way I did.
Eleanor gets drunk, hogs all the shrimp, insults people, etcetera.
So I told Vicky that I would handle the surveillance on the four of you.
That'll let us meet each day for Chidi's ethics lessons, which will apparently include me.
- Not a robot.
We can do this.
[snapping fingers] You sure are.
Here are the torture ideas you asked me to write up for next week.
It just like popped right into my noodle.
[laughs] Yeah, that's right.
Coast is clear.
Not a demon in sight.
Let me just get into the mind-set of a human.
"Oh, I'm a human, "and my breathing tube is next to my eating tube.
Just like I'm the best at getting empty water bottles to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.
You know what? I am the best at planning parties.
" Model tonight's dÃ©cor after my 2008 fundraiser for the Red Cross in Zurich.
No.
Look, look.
If you live forever, then ethics don't matter to you because, basically, there's no consequences for your actions.
It's called retirement.
It's rare, but when one of us really screws something up [clicks teeth] And what happens exactly? Well, it's fairly straightforward.
Gone.
Nothingness.
This is good.
He's having an existential crisis.
How does anyone do anything when you understand the fleeting nature of existence? It's pretty easy, man.
I mean, you learn about death when you're a kid, and it's just not that big of a deal.
I'm lying, okay? You caught me.
Congratulations.
And at the end of that long day, I had to use one of my favorite duffle bags to do something very gross that I did not like.
Now, let's celebrate that dead dog's life by bringing Mommy another bottle of white.
Mike, listen to me, you have nothing to worry about.
You still have around 70% of your brain left.
Or you could just sit tight.
The entire party are going to be heading over here soon.
" Flying station's over there if you want to fly like a falcon.
[exclaims] And over there we filled a ball pit with puppies.
- Where's Michael? - [groans] [engine revving] Uh I think I found him.
There they are! Que pasa, muchachos? Hey there, bud.
Michael just asked that I change my appearance, and also say things like, "You're so funny," and "So how many quarterbacks are in a home run?" [giggles] Man, repressing your feelings is great.
I was feeling stressed all the time, and now it's just so easy.
I mean, they hit on you when they're drunk, and their breath smells like supplements, but overall they're pretty harmless.
It's Chinese for "Japan.
I mean the guy contemplates his own death for one forking minute and completely loses his grip on reality? [somber music] [whispering] You didn't have to come.
I said I'm fine.
Can you just chill? I don't want to turn Dad's funeral into a roast.
I'm not.
Well, we're at his funeral.
It's pretty clear I did! I won! He's dead! Up top! Whoa.
[unicorn huffs] So you all just stay here and have fun.
Okay, well, if that's what you want.
Or the Sharper Image Catalog.
What can't those guys ionize? By the way, I am feeling amazing.
Listen, when you guys first took over, I was upset, but it's all good now.
I mean, anger is toxic.
I'm too miserable to stay here for one more second.
Why? There are baby monkeys and dolphins to ride and the game of "Hungry, Hungry Hippos" with actual hippos.
Can't stop moving.
If I stop moving, I'll start thinking and if I start thinking, I'll start thinking about things I don't want to think about, like death.
I mean, emotionally, he's all over the map right now, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think this can be solved with a book.
What's the big whoop? I dealt with death, and I was fine.
A family pack? [dramatic sobbing] [clears throat] [solemn music] I don't know if what I'm going to say is going to hurt or help, but screw it.
Do you know what's really happening right now? You're learning what it's like to be human.
I've been there.
And everybody's been there.
And moreover, what's this say about me, about the life I lived? The way they're torturing me is through event planning mishaps, and it works.
Am I really that shallow? Listen, back in Jacksonville, I was in charge of a 60-person dance group.
Lately, you've been really down on yourself.
But you're the most amazing person I've ever met besides Michael, and he was constantly torturing us so I'd only rank him a ten.
"Excellent progress this week.
"Tahani devastated by party mishap.
[sighs] Surprisingly so.
But we should still discuss Want some breakfast? I know how to make cereal.
Now, you can steer to another track, but on that track is one person you would kill instead of the five.
What do you do? Do we know anything about the people? Like, is one of them an ex-boyfriend or that snooty girl from Rite Aid who was always silently judging my purchases? It's like, yeah, chicky, a Baby Ruth and birth control.
- Um, kill one, save five.
- Good! But there's a lot of other versions of this, like what if you knew one of the people? Does that change the equation? Or what if you're not the driver, you're just a bystander? Or let's throw the trolley out altogether.
- People good.
People good.
- That sounds fun.
- Right? But I was gonna dive into next week's reading, I'm afraid.
Right.
Then you can talk about why it is that you don't want anyone to know we're together.
He's not even a person.
He's just a bunch of evil shoved up the butt of an evil mannequin, you know.
But definitely a no on the rap musical? I mean, if we really [rapping] My name is Kierkegaard, and my writing is impeccable.
Check out my teleological suspension of the ethical.
Close enough.
Jason and I are sleeping together.
- Have a seat.
- [soft ding] Hi, I'm your therapist, Janet.
But I know for a fact that if you steal a loaf of bread, it's a negative 17 points 20 if it's a baguette because that makes you more French.
Okay.
I used what I called the "Duke Rule," because Duke is both minimum acceptable university and rank of nobility.
You've never dated anyone like Jason before.
That'll only slow things down.
Look, I'll tell you his side.
Why don't you just tell me the right answer? Well, that's what's so great about The Trolley Problem is that there is no right answer.
Ugh.
There are five workers on this track and one over there.
Here are the levers to switch the tracks.
[snaps fingers] [sighs shakily] [sighs with relief] [snaps fingers] Look.
See, buddy? None of this was real.
Thank you, Chidi.
So let's try again, hmm? [snaps fingers] Oh, uh, I-I thought maybe we would have a discussion.
Chidi! How are you, mate? Henry, move! - Oh, nice trolley.
- Move out of the way! - Henry, move! - I can't, Chidi.
And how does that make you feel? I just feel like Tahani's embarrassed that I'm not some sort of scientist who forecloses on banks.
I need another session with Janet.
Chidi opted to run over five William Shakespeares instead of one Santa Claus.
Okay, as much as I'm enjoying watching random people's heads fly off, I think we've taken this trolley thing as far as it can go.
I'm your friend.
I-I won't do it.
Oh, I know.
We'll do the one where you're in a boat next to a volcano, and you can either save 50 people, or one awesome dog or whatever.
I thought that was clear from my laughter.
Oh, come on.
You keep saying that we need you, or we'll end up getting tortured forever.
But then when we do help you out, we still end up getting tortured.
What he really wanted was to torture me, using the thing that I love most in the world.
Woven belts? Oh, teaching.
This is what he always wanted me trying desperately to teach him something that he never intended to learn so I'd end up miserable with my glasses all smudged up from sweaty-forehead stress grease.
Okay.
Therefore, quite good at sex.
Here's the thing.
Aw, I'm happy for you guys.
[gags] [frog croaking] Huh.
No.
[clears throat] No.
Eventually Chidi will get over it.
Ah! [laughs] Leaving it up to the other person to be the grown-up yet another classic Shellstrop move.
Thank you.
Tahani, here's yours.
- It is? - Yeah.
Jason, here you go.
This isn't an apology.
It's a bribe, and I'm not interested.
You want me to say, "Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry "because I didn't understand human ethics and you do.
"It made me feel insecure, and I lashed out.
It's white chocolate, and it is nasty.
Listen, we just wanted to thank you for all of your help.
I don't know why.
And it's getting worse.
[mechanical whirring] Oh.
Hello, I'm Janet.
And you just walked in and stole her? It was that easy? You didn't have to choke out an angel or anything? Doors were unlocked, no security.
I mean, it makes sense, right? They're good, so they're stupid and trusting.
Use the good one.
Janet, you and I are about to have a real adventure together.
Yeah, this is very bad.
Let's run a full diagnostic, Janet.
"Hello, and welcome to your new Janet.
"Janets are brought to you by the makers of light, darkness, and everything.
Can't you just reset these things? What do you do again? Oh, it's the ears, yeah? It's it's, uh It's down, down, out Vicky, can I can I speak to you just for a second outside? Look, this is a common problem, and I've got it under control.
I don't know, man.
No, actually, I had this great idea the other night.
Thought it was worth exploring.
Wonderful.
- So smart.
" Hop up on the table, there.
[quirky music] [To-do] All right, great.
A 14-ounce ostrich steak impaled on a giant novelty pencil that says, "Lordy, Lordy, I'm Over 40.
" Here you go.
[solemn music] This is all my fault.
I told you a lie that first day we met.
Top notch.
You're in luck here.
Michael's fine.
Sounds good, Michael.
Hi, guys.
I'm broken.
Aww, babe, you admitted it.
That's sweet.
Nothing to worry about.
Happens sometimes.
That glitch appears to be limited to this building.
- So Vicky won't know.
Interesting.
I guess I did.
No, it wasn't.
I'm always happy to help people.
When was the first glitch? When I said I was happy to give Jason and Tahani couples therapy.
And the second glitch? When I said I was happy to see them embracing.
I am not.
I am not that.
Sorry, I say everything in a cheery manner, but in this case it may be inappropriate.
So I'll try again.
"Janet will rapidly collapse in on herself.
"When Janet is roughly the size of a marble, "she can be launched into space "through an inter-dimensional suction tube or eaten as a midday snack.
So it looks like it's [slicing] Adios, Janito! Hey, guys.
Sorry to interrupt, um, but you didn't give me a heads-up about this new Vicky torture uh, the one with the needles in my face.
Marbleize me, Michael.
It's the only choice.
[melancholy music] Okay, that was the last pudding shop.
Great.
I can help you.
It's too hard to explain, but there are certain aspects of my plan that that you just can't understand.
[laughs] Oh, yeah, okay.
Let's make all these restaurants frozen yogurt.
Yes.
Sorry.
Okay, look, see, here here's the reason.
See, I promised the four humans that we would escape to the Good Place once and for all.
[melancholy music] You're my friend, Janet.
That's why I can't kill you.
Michael.
That was so nice of you.
Kill me.
No.
I mean, he's a ding dong, but also a straight hottie.
So, up top.
- Can you get drunk? - Not really.
Although, if I stand next to a powerful array of magnets, I do get pretty loopy.
Forget it.
But you don't need to worry.
And I should be able to avoid glitches by watching what I say around Jason and Tahani.
Ah, thank you for your help.
Take all the time you need.
[chime rings] - Hi, there.
Michael, Michael, Michael, Clichael, Clichael, Clichael.
Janet, you can't make a person.
Oh, my God.
I'm in there, too? What's going on right now? It's my first time making someone, so he might be a little bit off.
I'll miss you like crazy.
- I'll miss you more.
I'll miss you more.
Bye! That's my first time making someone so he might be a little bit off.
Babe! Don't be jealous.
- I love you now.
Already? I mean, that's so fast.
Well, when you know you know.
All this time indoors has degraded my skin from radiant to merely dewy.
Me? Dewy? Well, there is going to be plenty of sun and fun at the private campsite that I set up for you at the edge of the neighborhood.
" Again? You watch that movie a lot.
Well, it's basically my favorite movie of all time.
- Okay.
What if the reason you want to murder someone is to make your life easier? That's okay, right? Is there a problem here, bud? Okay, I'll just tell you.
Oh.
Did you do that because of what I said? Yes, because of what you said.
- Say "goodbye," Derek.
- Ah, good-bob.
" It's kind of fun I guess, but can I teach you a different game? In this one, you just whack it as hard as you can in whatever direction you want.
Jaguars rule! [glass shatters] The Jaguars are very good.
If we get rid of Derek, then maybe Janet will start glitching again Okay, if we can't kill Derek, then we've got to break up Jason and Tahani.
If that relationship ends, then Janet won't feel sad anymore, and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself.
I'll tell you what else would cause them harm, getting caught and being sent to the real Bad Place to be tortured for eternity, which will happen if Derek blows our cover.
I know, but we'll also be sent to the real Bad Place if we do bad things.
I went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School in Northeast Jacksonville, which was really just a bunch of tugboats tied together.
Didn't you get seasick? No, sorry they were tied together in a junk yard.
[chuckles] Okay, stop it.
No, no, no, I'm serious.
I'm stating a fact.
They are your friends! I don't know these people.
- Fine! - No, no, not fine.
Don't go somewhere else.
Oh, I hope Janet's back online.
- Janet.
I came here on purpose because this tree is my new house.
This is Derek's house, and Janet's not allowed in because I booby trapped it.
- No, no.
- Don't.
Your only goal has to be to spare Jason and Tahani from future pain by filling them in on Jason's past.
No, I got you, I got you.
Every day you teach me something new about art and history and why you shouldn't eat everything that smells good because sometimes, it's candles.
You're basically, like, a hot genius teacher who sometime has sex with me, your student.
I can't do it.
Professor Buzzkill got in my head.
At last we meet.
You've got a lot of nerve buddy.
Why don't you just reboot all of us? Tahani and Jason will forget they were ever in love.
It was a flukey thing.
I mean, the Doctrine of Double Effect, remember? Well, man, I'm working with a doctrine of not being completely effed, okay? I don't understand what you even like about Jason.
What does he have that I don't have? A soul and genitals.
Marcus? I always called him Ben.
Look, I gave you bad advice, okay? Jason was clearly important to you, and real heartbreak doesn't have a simple cure.
[groans] Talking about your feelings is the worst.
It's so much easier just to find a rebound guy and have sex about your feelings.
Janet, this relationship has been the best seven hours of my whole life.
It's been the only seven hours of my whole life.
That is some hot reabsorbing.
Can you get pregnant from reabsorbing? [wind chimes ringing] Uh-oh, I hear wind chimes.
Kind of like he's in power-saver mode.
Derek.
Cheese band.
Okay, okay.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
- About you.
I once even tried to rent socks.
How did I say that that easily.
Hey guys, sorry.
I know it's late.
I designed this entire torture chamber around the absolutely certainty that when the going got tough, you would give up.
That was the signature Shellstrop move.
"Don't use the fact that everyone's distracted to go back and steal more olives.
" - I get it.
Stick with the program, demon buddy.
I really feel like things are starting to click in our little study group.
I once even tried to rent socks.
Do you have any feelings like that for me again now? I'm sorry, but I I don't think I do.
Some people called you names, like "the Thomas Edison of incompetence," or "that dick.
" [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] But against all odds, it seems you've pulled it off.
Congratulations.
This is everything you've ever wanted.
I'd like to start by saying something I've wanted to say for a very long time.
Surprise, idiots! You're all in the Bad Place.
We'll be shutting this place down.
The four of you will be brought to the real Bad Pace, where your brains will be removed, studied, and batted around a stadium like beach balls.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
Janet? [GASPS] Oh, hi, you little cuties.
[GIGGLES] I love you guys so much, except for you, Jason, because I hate you.
No one can ever truly turn over a new leaf.
Sure, Ben Affleck told me he'd matured as an artist after he directed "Argo," but then, right on schedule, it was, "Guess what, Tahani, I'm gonna be Batman.
We know for a fact that the people from the Bad Place can't follow us there, and I vote for that.
I vote we No, sorry, and no offense, Jason, but the stakes here are too high to let someone with your limited intellectual processing capacity weigh in.
Keeblers car.
Kyra.
Michael was telling us to trust him.
I had a long talk with him the other night about the whole Derek incident.
They would call it a sit of doubting.
I never thought I'd be the one to say it, but this is getting out of hand.
Vicky, Vicky, this can work out great for both of us if we play our cards right.
Shawn thinks that this is attempt number two, right? Now, if I tell him that you've been in charge of this version, he's eventually gonna find out that there've been hundreds of failed versions.
Lucky for you, my friend, Jaguars games are the only ones televised in the Bad Place, because they suck! [LAUGHTER] No, they don't.
All we need is a defense and an offense and some rule changes.
This is exactly the place you should be.
Not super funny for a roast there, bud.
[LAUGHTER] You died alone because you couldn't commit to anyone who? - No.
- Jason Mendoza! [LAUGHTER] Okay, that's all my time.
We go to Shawn, and we tell him that we'll trade secret information about the reboots, if he'll go easy on us, and if that doesn't work, we try to get Janet free and head to Mindy's.
Agreed? Yeah, Michael sucks now.
Promise.
Now, you just relax.
I got it.
Ooh! Hey, help me get these bracelets off Good Janet.
- No I have some very interesting information about who's really responsible for this neighborhood.
Shawn, the humans are escaping.
Oh, Vicky, you didn't.
She definitely did.
You're not a demon.
You're a jerk.
- No duh.
- And as for Vicky - No, wait [SCRUNCHING] This is a PR disaster.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC] You guys! I was so scared for you.
[SOBBING] I told you he was on our side.
But then I figured it out.
Kierkegaard, baby! Leap of faith.
There's no way Michael would've forgotten the name Blake Bortles.
You say it a million times a day.
That was odd.
A host never runs off during their last song, because after it's over, you're supposed to act surprised when everyone drags you on stage and showers you with applause.
[GROANS] I'm never gonna find there he is.
- Derek.
Derek Michael wants us to stay here for some reason.
Eleanor, we have a train, a conductor, and a safe destination.
- All aboard! - [SHUSHING] The train is here.
- It's a train! - [BOTH SHUSH] Get onboard? - Actually, Derek - Derek.
Well, I mean, I actually left you more than 1,200 clues, because of how primitive your brains are, but I'm so glad you got enough to figure it out.
Wait, how did you escape detection, though? Well, I'm not ethically proud of this, but I framed Vicky.
I had to sell it, because everyone was watching.
- It was funny, though, right? - Absolutely not.
" There are wind chimes where my ding dong should be.
[CHIMES JINGLING] - I can work with that.
I have to design a complicated, unique, transportation vehicle.
- Is it Optimus Prime? - What? I can't believe we get to ride a real-life Optimus Prime.
I agree.
And although I believe I've asked - you this question already - There is no business class.
What was the name of your childhood pet? Korzoth, the ten-headed dog-spider.
And presto! [WARM MUSIC] - Dope.
Maybe I should've realized this wasn't the Good Place 'cause of all the diarrhea.
Maybe you shouldn't be eating all of that frozen yogurt right now.
I don't care where I live, as long as they have more of this frozen yogurt.
- Why? Why? - An unlimited library.
Each traveler will step upon the scale, and her soul shall be weighed.
If she's the best version of herself, it will permit her to board.
Relax, everyone.
We're all gonna be fine.
They're fears now.
Okay, I know this mood.
And how do I know that this version is the best version of myself? How do I know it's not version #85, or 322, or 558? Or 69, or 420? And then you get into the whole idea of consciousness.
And I mean just forget about best.
Now let's get you back on that scale, dorkus.
[CHUCKLES] Chidi, ready to try again? Yeah.
Should be the best version of myself now.
- [SCALE TOOTS] - [GROANS] Come on, scale.
Michael, can you tell us a little bit about that version? Reboot number 119.
All the restaurants were kabob places.
It's not for that.
Anyway, it just you know bloomed after that.
It is I, Tahani.
In case you were wondering, I am by definition the best version of myself, because my operating system is always updating.
No! My beautiful balloon scale! It's not yours.
No, no, please stop fighting.
I assumed if I bought myself some time, I could figure out a way in.
Guys, I tried a billion different ways.
I was stalling! So I could keep searching for a way in.
I would've been happy if you were to live in this neighborhood forever, but then Shawn came and just ruined the whole thing.
Completely out of options, are we? Not completely out of options.
We can do what the Shellstrops have always done when the chips are down.
You know my whole life, whenever I encountered any obstacles, I would simply say, "I would like to speak to a manager.
" But in our relationship, there was no manager.
Thank you, Jason, for making this moment a little easier for me.
["SITTING IN LIMBO" BY JIMMY CLIFF PLAYS] Dude, he's where I'm at.
Don't say anything.
Don't.
Or you came knocking on my office door asking for help with philosophy.
Is that how you think people meet? I don't know how normal people meet.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me, babe.
And I'll take it.
Because of the way we were conceived of and created, Janets don't typically give speeches.
Oh, she's done.
And you know what, it wasn't really Michael's fault.
We weren't getting into the Good Place anyway.
And we would like to present you with this human starter kit.
Car keys! So I could lose them, and say, "Has anyone seen my car keys?" I can do that you know that thing where [LAUGHS] Thank you! And Band-Aids for your stupid, fragile bodies.
Welcome to being human, buddy.
To Michael! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] [LORDE'S "GREEN LIGHT" PLAYS] [NAT KING COLE'S "UNFORGETTABLE" PLAYS] Unforgettable That's what you are - You don't remember? - No.
So random.
Okay.
In Autumn.
The off-season.
We should speak to the manager.
Wait, you said that there was a judge who decides on disputes between the Good Place and the Bad Place, right? Some sort of head honcho I could pace in front of and plead our case to and maybe even wag a finger at disapprovingly.
Let's do it.
You're serious? Yeah! What do we have to lose? All I've ever really wanted was to know what it feels like to be human, and now we're going to do the most human thing of all: attempt something futile with a ton of unearned confidence and fail spectacularly! Get up! Get up! Everyone.
[ENGINE HISSING] What up, idiot? This is the 8:22 express to Bad Place Headquarters.
We'd like to begin the boarding process with our first-class fat dinks.
In a way, the Good Place was inside the Bad Place all along? You know what? That's technically true.
- I'm gonna give it to you.
Yes.
See the Judge exists in a sort of neutral zone, separate from the Good Place and the Bad Place.
I'll get eggs, then.
So the only way to get to the Judge is through a portal, which is smack-dab in the middle of the main office at Bad Place Headquarters.
I had Janet make you each a Bad Place disguise.
And everyone who worked in the neighborhood has been sent back to their previous department.
I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work.
Any time I had a problem, and I threw a Molotov cocktail, boom! Right away, I had a different problem.
I actually dabbled in a bit of acting after university.
Although mostly I just stood around while Baz Luhrmann just threw glitter on me.
You cannot be Blake Bortles.
- Fine.
- I can't do this.
- Oh, boy.
How I've missed you.
Look, Eleanor, our goal here is to appear in front of a judge who is going to judge us.
What even is this thing? I hate suits.
They remind me of court and going to court and being my own lawyer against the advice of the judge in court and getting immediately convicted in court.
- Aww.
Janet, you need to get in character too.
Bad Janet, can I have a glass of water? No.
I would never give you that, you dumb person.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] All trains today are delayed by three hours, just like they are every day.
All passengers, you all suck, and you're ugly.
An area or location.
- It's pretty straightforward.
First person to floss in an open plan office? [MANNEQUINS WHIRRING] Well, she deserves to be tortured.
She's a monster.
I'm worried.
I mean 'cause you're our ticket out of here, genius.
'" This dude rules! All right, everyone.
We've got a lot of work to do.
It makes you smell the way "Transformers" movies make you feel.
Still can't believe those jagoffs got away from us.
Ah.
[JAZZY MUSIC] Oh, man.
I'm gonna get me a tall glass of piping hot corn syrup and a scooter, so I can roll around the mall.
- That's really good.
Ball tap! Oh! That was a firm ball tap, bro.
Anyway, your boy Trent and I worked together in partial decapitations.
Dude's a straight beast when it comes to torture.
- 'Sup, bro? - It's actually pretty choice that we're running into you right now.
You know I'd be all like, "No!" - But you know I can't.
- So weird, Trent, man.
A'ight.
Damn, you're good at this.
Hey.
Hi.
[LAUGHTER] That was sarcasm.
I had thought of that.
Your neighborhood Our neighborhood is being immortalized for its success.
It's all going to work out.
Jason is stalling by ranking MMA ring girls with them, but I have to do something.
Eleanor, you're wearing glasses now.
Take a breath.
Rub your lucky bookmark.
Go see "Chronicles of Riddick.
" Doesn't matter if your mom gets lonely and steals a bucket of Vicodin from the nurse's closet.
Let's roll.
[JAZZY MUSIC] Hey, butt ass.
Entering the bedroom.
- Oh, yeah! - Ow.
Looking good, buddy.
You lose some weight? [CHUCKLES] I wish.
I'm serious.
This one time I was assigned this a chick that I had to torture, and I just couldn't figure it out.
But I don't know, man.
Sounds kind of lame.
We have to get out of here right now.
All right, everybody.
- Want to meet them? - ALL: Yes! I'm Tahani Al-Jamil, a vainglorious attention seeker with enough jealousy to power Elon Musk's underwater mansion, which I've been to, by the way.
[LAUGHTER] I have, actually.
I've heard you say all that stuff.
I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
I got the travel pins! Yo! That looks like my boy Trent! And isn't that Rhonda Mumps? - Come on! - There he is.
And he's got the humans with him.
I don't have one! - Okay.
Okay.
But I don't think now's the time.
See, the trolley problem forces you to choose between two versions of letting other people die.
What's up?
[SCREAMING] [PORTAL WHOOSHING] [GROANING] That was Awesome! - I'm going again! - No.
Not even a mere toodleloo.
[PORTAL CLANGS] We're on our own.
Eh.
He could be right.
That's a burrito.
What's up, guys? Yeah, I did not think I had a case today.
Anytime anyone shows up in my chambers, the portal is sealed until I issue my ruling.
So, you guys can relax.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
That being said, sometimes I get bored and I cheat a little bit.
And the thing is, you didn't file any paperwork, and you have no advocate, and the rules say I gotta [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Send you back.
Your honor, please hear our case.
- Al-you-minnium.
- [GIGGLES] I love that! And I love your passion.
I did what I had to do.
Oh, you had to junk your jeans? [CLAP] How could you betray your own kind like this? Who taught you how to turn a human inside out by reaching down their throat and grabbing their butt from the inside? You did.
The point is, the four of them are in front of the Judge, and the Good Janet has escaped too.
You'll never find her.
Well, actually, sort of that way.
- Mrrup.
And if even one of you fails, you're all effed, right? Terrible idea.
I mean, truly awful.
- Using their archrivals, - the Tennessee Titans.
- No! If you play the game and you lose Oh.
All you have to do is go through there, walk down the hallway, and through the red door at the end.
That's it? That's my test? Yep.
I was just trying to prove that humans could be made to torture each other.
Instead, they helped each other and got better.
- They always do.
- I'm sick of smelling this guy's lumpy white ass.
You guys are in! We're in? What does that mean? You guys have made great strides and you made it to the Good Place.
- Congrats.
- You really do.
- [SQUEALING] Here's the thing, though.
Okay, obviously, this is the test, right? I bet the Judge gave Jason and Tahani the same offer, and whichever couple takes it, actually loses and the other two get in for real.
Oh! Diabolical.
Sorry, I feel weird saying this to an almighty judge, but you have hot sauce on your chin.
[MUFFLED] Thank you.
- What? - A choice that we have to make.
Yeah, you know, why can't one part of the calculation of our eternal fate be easy? [GRUMBLING] I don't know.
We were just talking about how you're a huge disappointment compared to your sister.
Have a seat, we'd love to get your take.
Apparently, wherever you've been, they've been keeping you well-fed.
You know, I've actually risked quite a lot to be in this room right now, so if you could just not be cruel for maybe 30 seconds, that would be lovely.
I was never going to be enough for you.
Never going to earn your respect.
I'm sorry we didn't have a better relationship.
And I wish you both the best.
All you'll have for entertainment is that giant stack of "New Yorker" magazines.
Oh, come on.
Janet.
I thought you were a marble.
Okay, our friends are going to the Bad Place, and us choosing to go with them won't lessen their suffering.
So, morally, we're allowed to go.
Wait, but what about the [DING] Well done, Eleanor.
You can take a seat and wait for the others.
Nope.
Brown.
But did I at least choose the right one? There is no right one.
They're hats.
[SPUTTERS MOCKINGLY] Now, Eleanor's test was about her selfishness, - and she actually - I failed.
I shoved an old lady down the stairs to get to the raw bar, 'cause I'm a shrimp fiend.
Every time they pull my eyeballs out through my mouth, I'll think of you.
[LAUGHS] I'm gonna frame that one.
[SIGHS] Good times.
All right, off to eternal damnation.
And think about where they started.
Uh, Jason, growing up in Jacksonville, what did you do for fun after school every day? Me and my friends whipped empty spray paint cans at flamingos.
Damn! That was intense! Look at my arm, y'all.
Look, I got goosebumps.
Anyway, I took a deep breath, told them I ate a Cheeto, and walked away.
Man.
This has been one of the craziest years of my life.
One of? Yeah, I'm not sure what I would do if one more insane thing happened.
All right.
Whatever.
Oh, no! Now the thing I said right after we kissed will always be "hot diggity dog.
" - [LAUGHS] - Whatever.
For the time being, The Judge is gonna put you in your own medium places, like Mindi St.
Clair.
- Yeah, give or take.
- Yeah? Somewhere in there.
Slow your roll there, Erin Brockovich.
First of all, y'all didn't get good enough to pass the tests I just gave you.
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
It's only four people.
Forever.
Mmm, mmm, mmm - okay, let's do it.
[GASPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Holy crap.
I just almost died.
And then someone pushed me out of the way, and the carts got, like, demolished by a truck.
I mean, I could've died.
I can't believe we all almost died.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop, and I think I might be a monster.
Tried.
Hard.
Yeah.
And? I can't be a part of it anymore.
You're wearing a wire? Yeah.
Company's being investigated for fraud, so I'm helping the feds bring everyone down.
I have a calcium deficiency.
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, man.
I didn't.
I apologize for being mean to you like a thousand times.
[APPLAUSE] Hi, welcome.
Nice to meet you.
Okay, guys, um, can I say something for a second? - I love you.
- Aww.
I tore your dress, and then I lied about it.
And then Brittany and I were the ones who made and sold the T-shirts.
Cool.
[GRUNTS] Okay.
Sorry, it's been a crazy month.
You know, moving was a hassle, and I'm in the middle of a lawsuit, and I ate vegetables for the first time, and I got diarrhea for, like, a week.
[GIGGLES] Mmm.
Yeah, that sounds like more fun.
I guess.
In like a sick Victorian boy kind of way.
Which one's my desk? [SIGHS] You realize what the problem is, right? Yes, but there's no way to help.
[CHORTLING] I'm only giving that guy three stars because he didn't let me stick my head out the moon roof.
- Last year on my birthday, I almost died, and then I did a bunch of stuff that was good, but weird.
And then I stopped.
The twerpy little twerps from the environmental place, they care, but I was a good person for six months.
That's like five years, and it felt okay, but not as good as I thought it would.
" And then when she started doing good things, that voice went away.
It was a relief.
What do we owe to each other? That is the question Tim Scanlon asked decades ago, and it is a question I will try to answer over the next three hours.
Ugh.
I'm going somewhere else.
[CALM MUSIC] G'day.
From the long, nerdy video about the little voice that tells you to be good? From the Cassat Foundation lecture series on the practical applications of ethical theory.
- Yes.
[GROANING] - Okay, let's do it.
- Yes! But there have to be strict rules.
It's kind of tricky, you know? It starts up a new timeline, so there might be some ripple effects.
But it's necessary for the experiment that we're doing there.
Or or no, maybe a sideways-facing seat.
I'm I'm going to get so motion sick! Oh, man! What do I do, just grab that key here Whoa, whoa, whoa! This key is made of the very first atoms that came into existence in the universe.
Knock yourself out.
[LIGHTLY TENSE MUSIC] Uh-oh.
I got to ride a bike.
I put a coin in a thing and got a gumball.
Now we just sit back and watch as they become better people.
Being good is for suckers.
I'm from "International Sophisticate Magazine.
" Mind if we ask you 582 questions? - Sounds delightful.
Do you think my name is the letter K? Just say yes.
If we're married, legally you can't arrest me.
- Michael, no.
I'm going to meet Eleanor someplace and plant the idea in her mind that she needs to find Chidi.
Need to head on back to Earth.
Travel papers.
It's only 4:30.
My shift doesn't end until 9 billion.
Our biggest exports are racist sheriffs and HPV.
But about a year ago, something crazy happened [KNOCKING] And I [BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH] Sorry.
I once got 12 out of 12 on a Buzzfeed quiz called "Do you know all the slang words the Kardashians invented?" - Congratulations? - Thank you.
I'm going to be honest.
And I know that seems zonk-atronic that's Khloe's word for crazy but I need someone to help guide me, morally speaking.
And I think I need it to be you.
Yeah, but I'm not your student.
I'm just some hot rando who walked in off the street.
I was frozen here, unable to make a single decision, and I almost got crushed by an air conditioner.
This is a sign.
Now what we do is we make a lengthy incision from your eyebrows to the nape of your neck, and we peel your face back, right, then slice your skull open.
And I just randomly stab at your brain with an electrified needle.
[LIGHT MUSIC] This is your hippocampus.
It regulates memory.
You philosophers can spend your entire life mulling over a single questions.
That's why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE] Wow, Chidi.
Well, that's the beauty of it.
Anyone can live this way.
But on the bright side, I lost control of my bladder.
Someone got it on video, and now "Leg Press Whizzer" has 62,000 views on Youtube.
Blueberry muffin for ya? Uh, I don't know, maybe.
I can't decide.
It's about perspective.
Sometimes, when you're feeling helpless, the secret is to help someone else.
Do you not do that? You can do it for free.
I got to say, I enjoyed playing the role of mysterious librarian, and I really [BAD ACCENT] nailed the Australian accent.
Can I just ask? We torture, like, 30 billion humans.
Why do you care so much about these four? [INTENSE MUSICAL BUILDUP] Never mind.
Choose something deeply terrible to inspire us.
Wherever you go Oh, yeah.
Oh, well, I'm headed that way, too.
I'll walk with you.
'" - Chidi, hey! - Hey! - I got a question.
Is it "What's my thesis topic?" - Because I still don't know.
And since you loved it so much last time, I was wondering if you could just pop back in there and help me out? - Oh, absolutely.
- Cool, okay.
You're both teachers who are hot for teacher.
[SQUEALS] How have you not asked her out yet? - Are you scared? - Well, it's not impressive to guess that I'm scared, Eleanor.
- What is one plus one? - Two.
- What color is the sky? - Blue.
Next question's for Simone.
Simone, are you annoyed at Chidi for waiting so long to ask you out? - Yes, I am.
Yes, I would.
Thank you for asking.
I've left too much to chance.
Until our group is back together again, this whole thing is hanging by a thread.
Nope, also weird.
Just go.
I'm getting close.
Good.
- Shut up, Glenn.
Morning, teach.
Also, not a great understanding of virtue ethics.
Oh, we can agree to disagree.
- Sorry, Reginald.
- Oh, no worries.
Tried on all his giant shoes.
One of my top five Christmases.
Also, I wanted to kiss you last night, but I chickened out, so I'm going to kiss you now.
Good, yes.
Oh, good, you're here.
Eleanor, meet the newest member of our ethical neuro-scientific study, Tahani Al-Jamil.
So how did you come to join our team? Well, it's a bit of a story, I suppose.
It, uh, began about a year ago.
That's what I call Prince William.
Since he'd married a commoner, I assumed he'd know some needy people they could go to.
I need to get out of the spotlight.
Copy that, I'll see what jets are available.
I worked.
I gave back to Mother Earth.
Look, here's my card.
Think about it.
No, they want you to take over for Oprah.
Also, this investor wants to meet you.
I'm sure you're already rolling in dough from this incredible scam, but have you thought about merch? Because we could, uh, we could partner here.
I made a fortune selling Nirvana Orbs, which is to say, driving range golf balls that I painted silver.
Al-Jamil, it's okay.
You and I are the same.
Al-Jamil doesn't have time to participate in an ethical study at some random university.
If you want to meet her, you can sign up for the "Get Out of the Spotlight" cruise, with special guests Deepak Chopra and Will.
Send me the info.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.
- Mm-hmm.
Three down, one to go.
You may have a few other obligations, but basically Uh, thanks, but no thanks, man.
- I'm done with dancing.
[GROANS] - Yo, what happened? - I couldn't breathe.
The snorkel must have been broken.
Why? Doesn't matter.
Continue.
Right now.
Yeah, okay.
We're going to do this the right way.
No more crime, and if you don't like that, you can walk out that door.
What? No, why? Because you have 40 people onstage.
The limit is eight.
Yep, he just confessed to the robbery.
- Damn it! - That was easy.
- A failure.
- You're not a failure.
Bro.
I'm only saying this because I love you.
But now, and I know this sounds crazy, but I'm starting to think there might be more to life than amateur street dancing competitions.
It's funny, but I know exactly what you mean.
No, go, go.
[WHOOSH] Well, that is the last time I'll need to head back down there.
Oh, this guy's a jumper.
You can tell.
I mean, everything is going according to plan, and nothing is going differently from the plan.
Yes, that's a very not weird way to put it.
- [GIGGLES] - You guys want to come with? - BOTH: Ooh.
- We can watch together.
Yeah, but we didn't, and more importantly, Jason just arrived in Australia.
The four of them are finally together.
That should be fine for me.
It's roughly the same size as Nicole Kidman's cryogenic anti-aging chamber, and I've never had a problem in there.
[TENSE MUSIC] This doesn't make any sense.
They're all there.
[HEAVY BASS NOTES]
Michael, a demon has infiltrated the group.
It's so nice to hear someone say, "Eleanor, you're the reason this is all happening" who isn't a judge in small claims court.
Thank you for this, Eleanor.
Got it.
Also, what a grim death that would have been.
Is it a spider? Yes.
Do you think taking a spider in an MRI machine will give you superpowers? Hey, it might work.
Whatever.
What are you doing here, Trevor? Shawn hacked the judge's system, and we caught you cheating, getting your four little cockroaches to meet up.
Dick Tracy called back on his watch phone and said you better "watch" out.
Shoot, second too late.
- Yeah.
We can check out Sydney, get to know each other, bond.
Oh, someone's seated there.
But if you purchase our Manifest Destiny package for $30, you can have anyone you want forcibly removed from the table.
- I get a sweatshirt.
"The Brainy Bunch.
Can I get you started with some drinks? Our specialty cocktail tonight is the Fourth of July.
It's half an apple pie blended with Southern Comfort and Coca-Cola served in a Chevy hubcap.
- Roomies.
- Roomies! That is technically an idea.
I like Jamaican food.
Listen to the reggae, and smoke the joints.
Giraffe.
Gah! Look what I've been reduced to.
Did he finish it? I don't know, and it's making me crazy.
I got to find him.
Excuse me.
Hey, El train, you think with all these new "Star Wars" movies they'll finally make a new "Spaceballs"? I'm sorry, I'm getting a text and I have to take this.
Could be fun.
I once played a drinking game with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively at their macrobiotic farm with a particularly robust batch of homemade kombucha.
All right, and I'm going to do my librarian act and nudge Chidi back to the table.
- Uh, yummy.
- I can't have that.
- Jeez.
It's me, the librarian from the library.
Oh, right, hi, sorry.
Ah, la-la-la-la.
Mm, I'm tired.
Um, there's only room for one male subject in an academic study, so keep the one who got there first.
Catchy.
You are.
I'm sorry, but this is just how it has to be.
Chidi's melting down.
Jason and Tahani just left together.
Ah, poop hands! I can't believe you fell for that.
Are you all right? You didn't sleep at all last night.
I've done a million of these things.
I promise I'll warn you if you cross any lines.
And it goes Attention, everyone.
Do not look at me.
Thank you so much for getting me home safely.
I wouldn't blame you should you ostracize me for my boorish behavior.
He's in limos all the time.
Oh, what a life.
It's outside.
Thanks.
That was really brave.
Now, I know we barely know each other, but, please, could you give me three months? Can you give me three months? I am I am asking you as a friend.
Said that I was right about Eleanor and Chidi having an unbreakable bond.
I don't think you understand how that joke works.
Now? Right now? Um, like, all of us, or Yep.
So, this is Earth, huh? Whoo, that's pretty cool.
Now, granted, I also tricked the doorman and snuck down to Earth, but what are we gonna do Do you realize what you did? You meddled in human affairs.
That ripples out, man.
Blake Bortles is kind of okay, maybe.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you intervened in human affairs.
I mean, because of you, Byron Allen owns The Weather Channel now.
Buckle up, folks.
Let's go, right now.
[suspenseful music] [door whooshes] Okay.
That was an insane thing for us to do.
That's impossible.
It's a magical key, you dick.
Only the Accountants have that information.
But I did install cameras and microphones, so at least we can keep our eye on them.
" That was me.
I wrote that email.
Great news, everyone.
The funding from the neuroscience department - came through.
- Fine.
Oh, you guys, let's take a picture.
If Eleanor has to get a job, she'll miss class, and that will slow down her progress.
Are you sure we should be doing this? It kind of feels like cheating.
Keep going.
Keep going, keep going.
This morning, I found a lottery ticket on the ground outside my apartment, I scratched it off, and I won $18,000! - Wow! - That's amazing! Better luck next time.
Yes, sorry, from context, I see that is actually a large sum of money.
I enjoy American football.
I actually dated a player once.
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, boy.
- Great idea.
- Oh, you know? This is not as crucial to the mission, but I'd also love to arrange for them to get better computers.
Of course I remember you.
We dated.
I'm like a rock.
Ugh, stupid Larry! - Stop talking about rocks! - No, no, no, Larry, please.
Go to her.
Go to her! [soft whimsical music] Looks like you had a good night.
The we had intercourse.
- Yeah, again, I always get it.
Well, I don't know about every aspect.
SuperBoard, activate! Good morning, professor Anagonye.
It's very last-minute.
Just come as you are.
Anyway, everyone, I want you to meet Larry Hemsworth.
Oh, the legendary study group.
You're important, too! Fixing babies' spines is just as valuable as acting.
Tahani booked a flight for tomorrow morning, so this party is our only chance to talk them out of moving.
Vegemite canapÃ©? Ah, might as well.
[sighs] Mummy was right.
You should stay here in Sydney.
It's such a dynamic, international city that you've only seen 4.
Hate to say it, but the group probably needs a new member.
I don't know how we'll ever replace Tahani.
They'll do my left side for free, so.
[somber music] No, no, no, no, no! The whole group is splintering.
Boy, I know how that goes, not wanting something to end, feeling like your little team is the last thing standing between you and oblivion, that at any moment, the universe could fold up around you, and squeeze the last breath from your dying lungs.
You're a caterer, right? It's a very competitive industry.
I get that we all have meaningful lives outside this study.
Well, Tahani and Chidi do.
No, you don't need to say it.
I I got it.
- [all gasp] Eleanor, please! [mocking accent] Oh, sorry, the deed is done.
Pip pip, too late.
Then, I saw my friend hiding behind a plant, and I got concerned.
Then, my friend lashed out at me again, so I'm gonna take off, and uh, leave her here with dirty leaves in her hair.
Or a binky.
That's a solid burn.
That's why we have racism and nationalism and why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin hate fans of The Rock.
No, we hate The Rock because he went Hollywood, and Stone Cold keeps it real, so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis.
The other possible medical diagnosis is that you're just a bit of a dick.
[both laugh] [bright music] Why don't you take my cab? I think me needs to go apologize to us.
Each summer, we can all stay in one of our respective houses, mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you.
We should all meet up in Jacksonville.
- [exhales] Okay, I think I've figured out a plan where they stay in Australia, and only five random bystanders get hurt.
- It's called arson.
Correct.
I know everything.
Do you even know how to reset the timeline on Earth? No, I'm assuming that there's, you know, a knob, or or a button, or you know, maybe you maybe you unplug it and then plug it right back in.
I I don't ca there's got to be a way.
What are you doing down here?
What the hell is that? Oh! Hey, guys! What are you doing down here? Well, we came to get more champagne, which is right behind that magic door.
Just give me one second, okay? How do we get out of this? Well, they heard us explaining the entire system of the afterlife, and they saw an inter-dimensional door open and close, so not a ton of wiggle room here.
But you're forgetting one, crucial piece of information Right? You're forgetting one crucial piece of information that'll save us.
[suspenseful music] I knew it.
Agent Fuqua and I are paranormal investigators.
Who's Janet? Frenchy.
Sorry Frenchy's nickname is Janet.
Just give me one more second.
One.
[sighs] It's over.
[solemn music] Ah.
So sorry for eternally dooming you.
And that's our bad, guys.
Sorry.
I'm my brain is melting.
So you get it.
This broke me! The dot, over the I, that broke me.
- Not if I see you first.
- Let's go, Jason.
? - No.
- Why not? Well, because it's not really my birthday.
I need you to act as my bodyguard like my friend, Kevin Costner, in that movie where he was a bodyguard "The Bodyguard.
" No problem my cousin once hired me to do crowd control for his off-brand SeaWorld.
Lovely as it sounds to add to my collection of wings and atria, the gift will be anonymous.
As you wish.
"God remains dead, and we have killed him.
"Who will wipe this blood off us? "What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent?" Friedrich Nietzsche, 1882.
So A man i fes to.
by mi Where's the H? This keyboard doesn't have an H.
Look, there have to be rules.
Every place has rules.
Yeah, in America, everyone does whatever they want.
Society did break down.
Just take it.
Take it, Eleanor.
If you're gonna go see him, could you bring it along? Of course.
I would love to bring some rando his mail.
Do you guys have, like, a "take-a-car, leave-a-car" tray? No? Just take it.
Just take it.
Now you can buy a bigger chin guitar! This was a truly great plan.
Oh, thanks.
We're technically supposed to shut down the bank if anyone from Florida even walks in.
Look, all my life, this money has been a weight around my neck like the Heart of the Ocean necklace my friend James Cameron once gave me.
I have all your crap.
- Thank you.
I started a new job a few months ago, and I got really nervous.
So my daughter, Carolyn, drew this for me to make me feel better.
Come on.
Dip your paws in my chili.
Next, there's consequentialism.
The basis for judgment about whether something is right or wrong stems from the consequences of that action.
And now I'm gonna eat my marshmallow-candy chili in silence, and you all can jump up your own butts.
Is that gonna be on the test? Yes.
Feeling all right? - I feel fine.
- Hmm.
I added all the data we've gathered here on Earth - in chart and in graph form.
- Hmm.
[gasps] Hey, guys.
It it's really nice to see you.
So the four of us the six of us, really, are doomed.
Our fates are sealed.
I mean, why not try? It's better than not trying, right? That's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor.
Let's try.
- [scoffs] But first, I have to go to the bathroom forever.
There you are, my love.
- Didn't like you.
Huh.
Who are we saving? No one from my high school, I will tell you that much.
Well, before we do anything, I have to break things off with Simone.
You're damn right they didn't.
I just wish I could end things in a way that I knew wouldn't hurt her.
[pleasant music] Jacksonville, what up? - Duval! - ALL: Duval! Poor Larry.
But "If you love someone set them free.
The Donkey Doug with whom you tried to blind airline pilots with laser pointers? - Yeah.
- The Donkey Doug who's banned from Disney World for biting Buzz Lightyear? In his defense, he thought it was someone else.
A few years ago, Donkey Doug was very close to getting his electrician's license.
So if we get him to finish the training, he can earn an honest living and be on his way to getting more Good Place points, which is why we're all here.
" But not like Yes, yes, we get it.
Thank you.
Wow, that's the first time that line has ever failed.
You must really love him.
They'll play a tone that will trick your brain into seeing what I've programmed.
[electronic beeping] Ah Wow, so this is - I'm here.
- Which is it? - I-I can't because of - [sighs] Janet! - Who's Janet? And why are you screaming her name into the sky? You know what? Whatever.
- Good-bye, Chidi.
I got a business proposition for you.
Pillboi! - Oh, dip! Jason! - Oh, dip! Pillboi! - Oh, dip! Pillboi! - Oh, dip! Donkey Doug! - Oh, dip! Jason! - This is remarkable.
And this time, it's not fake meth.
All right, Pillboi, tell him about our new product.
We should bid fast.
The other sharks are gonna want in.
It's like, get over yourselves.
Is there any way I can try a bunch of different things in a row - to see what works? - Bing.
What? Hang on.
[snaps fingers] [sighs] I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm dying.
Nope.
[snapping fingers] Simone the last year has been truly amazing, and with that in mind - Will you marry me? - Yes! Yes! Of course I will! Oh! [applause] Wait, what am I doing? Why did I think this would work? Chidi, I'm gonna go ahead and reboot this one myself.
Remember everything.
Right leg crossed over left.
- Thank you.
- Psych! It's still Eleanor! I can't believe you fell for that, you doink.
Yes, please.
- Do that for me.
- And your accent is so cute.
Your accent is so cute.
Also, and perhaps this is less important, but there's an awful lot of dog hair on the furniture, and I have not seen a dog.
Not bad, right? Double Trouble comes in three delicious smell-flavors: Raspberry Perspirant, Cedarwood Melon Blast, and 24-Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme.
You're his dad.
This is huge, J.
Why was I friends with him? Maybe this is what'll put your father on the right path.
And, hey, it's not like he's robbing a bank.
I mean, two factories I can understand, but but three? You you might want to consider the possibility that your father's a lost cause.
I have an idea, but I need your help.
Wish me luck.
[exhales forcefully] - Oh, hi.
Hello.
Will you be eating with us today? Just please give us one second.
Ya dumped.
- Okay.
Take half of one of these, wash it down with a 5-Hour ENERGY, and you'll be golden.
Body high with mild visuals.
That's it? You don't need any more information? I mean, do you want to tell me? - Not really.
- Cool.
Just go.
Be a person.
If you're here to tell me an energy drink body spray is a bad idea, I've heard it before from a bank and some doctors.
I'ma help you make Double Trouble, but you got to leave Pillboi alone from now on.
It's the cops.
What do we do? Yo, let's get out of here.
And someday, you'll do this exact thing for your son.
I mean, I hope not, but thanks, Donkey Doug.
And my feelings have changed.
I wish I could tell you why.
So your covert mission is to continue to report to this job until you receive our signal.
Now, this is the most important thing.
[sniffles] I love you, bro.
[both crying] - Psych.
I never got to do that with my parents, and now they're both dead, so it's impossible.
So the thing is, one of your parents is not technically actually dead.
I promise.
A police officer came to my home and told me that my mom had been accidentally trampled to death when she bent down to adjust her toe ring at a Rascal Flatts concert.
What the hell, Mom? Okay, baby, I can explain everything.
Let's all just take a breath.
Okay, now this is making sense.
You change your name, bag a rich loser with a tacky house.
Hi, I'm Dave.
- Michael.
- [giggles] I can't believe I have to wait in line to see my own sister.
I have never waited in any kind of formation before, let alone a line.
Ugh.
Maybe we should just go.
As a frog stares up in awe at the tree top, so, too, does humanity gawk at the purity of a blinding truth.
Napkins and forks are in the back.
[laughs] So, Michael, what do you do? Ah, well, uh, I'm an architect.
- Get out of here.
7 shots of Seagram's 7 in 7 minutes.
It's Diana's morning drink.
" Oh.
[chuckles] What a fun way to say a normal thing, right? Well, I've got to go get ready.
And I'm not even a tequila guy.
Wow.
That one's got a bunch of colors.
That's got to add some value.
Why are you in my room? Oh, hey, girl.
What's up? How old are you three? - I'm nine.
She's a kid.
You can't disembowel her toys.
The Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead in this suburban boredom factory.
She's scamming them.
Give me a break.
Until Kamilah accepts my apology this open wound will hinder any progress she might make toward getting into the Good Place.
I got distracted.
She's amazing.
[laughter] Savage.
Hello, I'm Diana Tremaine.
Oh, I know your name.
I'm calling you a mark.
That was mostly sex.
[chuckles] Your mother is a very confident and selfish lover.
Well, listen, she has been nothing but honest with me.
And I like that she's got a wild streak.
No, no way.
Why can't you accept that she might be living a good, honest life? That she's an attentive partner and a good mom? Because I wanted that mom.
I don't really understand the job.
Listen, um, I'm sorry that I didn't think this whole thing was real.
No.
No.
Really? You don't think they would be proud of her for having a whole museum wing dedicated to her work? My parents' standards were incredibly high, and they were impossible to please.
Plus, they always pitted my sister and me against each other.
You're the boobs? Sorry.
Once Jason said it, that's all I can see.
[sighs] [sighs] They were wankers, weren't they? Ah! The absolute biggest wankers on Earth.
Let them go, please.
Ya basic.
No, Mom.
You're happy here.
But you need to commit to this which means getting rid of that stash of escape money.
It seems like you've turned into a really good person, and you clearly didn't get that from me, so props to whoever helped you.
Is there more cash in your bra? Always.
Yes.
Smart.
Oops.
Ah, just a little oversight.
You get it.
The others are on their way back from Budapest.
I never even told a boyfriend I love him.
Oh, crap.
Fire up Janet's memory gizmo.
Flooding your brain with memories from the afterlife is dangerous.
Luckily, before we shut the neighborhood down, Janet saved a complete record of all the reboots.
Put those in your ears.
[DEVICE BEEPS] As I told you, recalling afterlife memories here on Earth has some significant side effects.
You should be back to normal in about 20 minutes.
I'm skipping all of the sleeping and chewing.
You guys are always either sleeping or chewing something.
Two months of philosophy class, and you're already [SNEEZES] What are you grinning at, weirdo? [LAUGHS] Come on, we're gonna be late for the neighborhood meeting.
I gotta say, it seems - like I was really nailing that philosophy class.
Fabulous.
I haven't had a pet since Barbra Streisand gave me one of her cloned Siamese cats, and it killed itself.
- [CHICKEN CROWING] - [DOG BARKING] Ooh! This one looks just like the one I had when I was a little kid.
He's so cute! But is is this one a little a little cuter? I mean, this pup looks friskier.
Oh my.
I mean, should I take the cutest puppy, or is that shallow? And is it even okay to separate them? Are they brother and sister? Or or perhaps, married? Dude, they're heaven puppies.
My indecision has once again cost me happiness, and I will now suffer the consequences.
How many pets have gone unclaimed? Three.
Janet made him a little cowboy hat.
Isn't that stupid? [GIGGLES] - Chidi? Hello? - Shh.
- Instead of - Ow.
Deep wounds.
Yeah, no, you're right.
"Not that interesting.
Can I ride your centaur? I'm afraid T'Hania's quite particular about whom she allows to ride her.
I tried, and she gave me a withering stare.
Tonight we're having a party where everyone gets to transform into their pets for a few minutes, as a treat.
Chidi can fly like an owl, and you can do whatever lizards do.
No big deal.
Janet can find it.
Lizard? Lizard? Where the fork are you? [SOFTLY] Lizard! Ugh! Why didn't I name you? - Hey.
- [SCREAMS] - Why? - Oh! Oh, no! Chidi! Sorry I shoved you, man.
You're amazing.
[TENDER UPBEAT MUSIC] After that, you spent all your time together.
You're capable of human love.
Congrats.
And love is stronger than anything you can throw at us.
No, it's not.
I forced you to choose the lizard, and then I made that lizard run away.
I made it all up! Don't you understand that? This [SNAPS] That's why I didn't want to give you your memories back.
I'm not mad at you.
I can't be mad at a demon for being evil.
Okay, yes.
I put you and Chidi in close proximity, because I needed you to drive each other crazy.
That's ridiculous.
I didn't make you kiss Chidi by that lake.
I'd take off if I were you.
The second we close, they use this place to shoot pornos.
Easy.
- [DEVICE BEEPS] - Okay, here's a perfect example! - [LOUDLY] In the very first attempt - Dude.
I beg you, tell me.
Hey, I love you, man.
The only reason I cared enough about Chidi to do that, was because you forced us together, made me feel bad for causing him pain.
- Okay, yeah - Yeah.
I mean, that's worth watching.
[SOFT LAUGH] It's great.
- - I know all your private shames, like that you don't wash your feet in the shower; your first concert was Barenaked Ladies; and you have frequent sex dreams about Sam the Eagle, from the Muppets.
Well, he's very authoritative, and I find that reassuring.
What? We don't know.
Maybe there's a mega-demon who built a torture chamber for demons, and this whole thing is just him torturing you.
Disagree.
I think it's the coolest thing I've ever done.
And I want to believe that it matters.
So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna use my free will right now to go pick up our friends at the airport.
Oh, I call window seat! [TENDER PIANO MUSIC] [DOORS SHUTTING ECHOES] I'm sorry.
You were right.
Take the Soul Squad to the next level somehow.
You're right.
It's it's someone way cooler.
Hey, everybody out of the car! Grab your bags! We're going to rural Canada! [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - Is it ready? - I guess.
Where am I? How long was I in there? You have missed a lot.
Now go through that makeshift portal.
- Hello.
Hope we have the right house.
Some people in town are saying you live a pretty interesting life out here.
Growing your own food completely off the grid? We would love to do a human interest story about you for the paper.
Great, great.
Oh, hey, you know, before we forget.
The next day all I could do was watch kung-fu movies and stroke a blanket that I thought was my cat.
But soon after, I designed a life that would maximize my point total and help me get into the Good Place.
Stars.
They really are just like us.
Let me know if you're not happy with them.
I have ice cubes if it's too warm and a koozie if it's too cold.
I mean, saving souls feels great, but Sydney to Budapest to Phoenix to Calgary I'm so jetlagged, I can't even regrender my chorf.
Don't even know what I was trying to say.
It's lovely.
Tell me about Chidi.
Everything I eat I grow myself.
The radish patch was actually here when I moved in.
There are no rules.
I am 100% sure there are.
I got five million points.
Damn, how'd you get so good at this so fast? So, in this whole other timeline, Chidi and I said "I love you" to each other.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
I've been mauled several times.
Oh, this little guy here might look innocent, but boy, he goes right for the squeaker if you know what I mean.
Watch.
Hey, give that guy your shoe.
That's how the system works, remember? Go get your shoe, idiot.
[CHUCKLES] Be right back.
That's just mostly because Eleanor and Jason made a bunch of dirty jokes about it.
It's a criticism of utilitarianism.
Thank you.
We're gonna head out now.
Forgetting someone's name that's definitely lost me some points.
Hey, you know, I've always secretly wished my name was Mark.
- Yes.
I mean, "no.
And I don't know exactly how to say this, but you and I are Bambadjan.
You know, I never thought about it before but yeah, we are kinda Bambadjan.
No, no, no, no, actual demons.
Like, from the Bad Place.
Now, where's Michael? We are here to celebrate the life of Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore, the snail.
I named him/her that posthumously because I imagine him/her to be the greatest and most talented snail ever to have lived.
Happy, slimy trails, old friend.
I'm sorry, I've got to leave right away.
But can I maybe give you just a little advice? I know I should donate more blood.
I'll try, but the last time I went down there they said I was so anemic, they ended up giving me blood.
- Sorry.
The point is, I have never met anyone so dedicated to making other people and snails happy.
You know, travel.
Drink regular water that wasn't inside you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk to Edmonton to give $85 to a snail charity.
Why don't you just take us to the Bad Place already, dude? Because I want to see the look on Michael's face when he realizes he failed.
Ah, Doug is a complete disaster.
And I drank his piss.
If you want them, you're gonna have to go through me.
That's the idea.
En garde.
Obviously, I'd never do that in a competition.
[WHOOSHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [BOTH GRUNTING] [GIGGLES] Three hundred points best score ever! - [PORTAL HUMMING] - [SCREAMS] Is it just me or is Janet a straight-up hottie right now? How are you this close to being dragged to Hell and still horny? I don't know.
And how did you know they were demons? I can't tell you that now! Screw it.
In Canada during this brawl with demons.
Let's get her to the door.
Yes, but I had the, uh Thank you, Janet.
How did you get down here? We have the only key to the door to Earth.
Now, why would you think that? Just a hunch.
And do you know what else I had a hunch about? - No.
Evidence isn't a good thing that you want.
It's a bad thing that you have to destroy or you go to jail.
Michael, Michael, Michael.
[PANTING] I forgot what you asked me to get.
Cool.
That sounds fun.
How's the hair? Is it still amazing? Michael, there may have been some side effects for the humans.
Huh.
And when you say "void" Oh, I mean a sub-dimension outside of space and time at the nexus of consciousness and matter tethered to my essence.
Does that help? It does not help.
Janet's void has a back door to the Janet warehouse in the Neutral Zone, which is right near Accounting.
You four will stay here while Actual Janet and I sneak through it and find the Head Accountant.
We're almost at the end, guys.
Just stay here, keep Janet's heads on straight.
- End of conversation.
- My name is Michael.
Well, we are white.
Let's all say white people things! Billy Joel.
We're Janets now.
So I thought we'd have some bitchin' Janet powers.
End of conversation.
Hi.
- Yeah.
- So what can I do for you? - Well, I'm concerned about certain anomalies in the point system.
We don't get a lot of visitors.
Follow me.
Philosophically speaking, there's the Chidi I am, who lived a certain life, and there's the Chidi you saw your soul mate or whatever, who had some entirely different life.
- They're not the same Chidis.
The theme's "Lord of the Rings.
" They're basically doomed.
We've got Hector over in American Coins, and my dear buddy, Matt, in Weird Sex Things.
I'm still waiting on a response to the request I filed for immediate suicide.
When people die, their biographical history and final point totals are sent to the relevant destination.
This batch is going to the Bad Place.
I don't want to see those memories because, philosophically speaking, they're none of my business.
They happened to someone else.
" That leads us to Derek Parfit.
- It does? - Parfit said even if I have memories from an earlier time, that doesn't necessarily mean it was me.
Hey, no peeking.
Accountants only.
They have been since the beginning.
"Og Gives His Rock to Grog.
[soft music] So, in essence, Hume thought that we don't truly have a self.
We're just a bundle of our ever-changing impressions.
- Jason, what is wrong with you? - Sorry, Janet.
I didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.
All right, why don't we look at No one.
No one got in.
And that was before I learned that I died and then un-died and then re-died.
I just can't take one more thing.
This seemed like the only option.
[high-pitched voice] Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor.
This is new.
I'm so annoyed at myself.
Not to brag.
I need you to hold it together.
Janet has a crush on you.
I'm sorry.
So, if there's nothing else "If there's nothing else"? Neil, be logical.
Not one Good Place resident in over 500 years? Not Jonas Salk? Not Harriet Tubman? Not one single Golden Girl? The Bad Place has hacked your system! No, it hasn't.
We keep wandering around these different realms expecting someone else to have the answer, but no one ever does.
You're the guy, Michael.
- I know.
What am I supposed to be doing right now? I don't remember.
You make fun of me a lot.
You once called me a human snooze button.
Uh-oh.
Ooh.
But there is some good news.
- There's some cake left.
Accountants only.
I need one of you to volunteer to do something outrageously insane that will either make you cease to exist or be really fun.
Come on.
Here you go.
We're in the Good Place.
Are we sure we're in the actual Good Place? It's rather carpeted.
The Good Place smells like whatever makes you happiest.
[sniffing] Warm pretzels.
I don't think we're in the main Good Place area.
This seems like this is some kind of a mail depot.
And you four won a contest.
- Really? - Really? Okay, not that.
We're coming from Accounting, and as we were climbing through the the mailbox, it it blew up.
The explosion was caused by demons.
I'm Michael, and this is my Neutral Janet.
Hello, also, not hello.
Make yourselves at home.
There's a sofa, that's a bowl of fruit, that's the door to the Good Place.
Chidi, help me.
- She said it's not gonna open.
And now all that stands between us and the actual Good Place is one door? What is that two inches thick? That's like four Oreos.
We're four Oreos from heaven.
Oh, sorry, you'd have to contact them directly, and that's definitely against the rules.
I see.
So, it's entirely untraceable? Sure is.
What a fun thought experiment.
[bright music] Jason, you seem thoughtful and that concerns me.
Do you remember that one time when we were in Janet's void, and we all looked like Janet? I do, yes.
When we were in there, I was wandering around, because you have the ability to make anything, and I wanted to see where you keep the roller blades.
And I accidentally saw that video thing about how you love me.
Be clear, be confident, and don't let them intimidate you.
Oh, wow.
Thank you for coming.
No, thank you for asking us to come.
Then get pluots, Kellen.
Get as many pluots as can fit in your tote bag.
Right now, we're together in heaven basically.
And we're in love.
Why not have our first date four Oreos away from paradise? You still wanna go out with me after I just showed you my anxiety sweats? Man, you must really be into me.
You have to admit, it's very odd that no one has gotten into the Good Place for 500 years.
While you wait, Kellen will stand by you, showering you with compliments.
Great job, Michael.
It's nice to be here.
And it's not nice to not be there.
- [groans] Jason knows that I love him, it stinks to hear about how the two of you are married, this beige outfit really washes out my not-skin, and if I don't remain neutral in front of Gwendolyn, she's gonna know we've been lying.
All of these new emotions I'm feeling are about to burst out of me, which might be super embarrassing.
You are, though.
I'm not worried about that anymore.
Is this a horny cry? No, I'm crying because I'm miserable, and it's all your fault.
Why? Do you not like the outfit? I love the outfit.
We are only giving ourselves 400 years to select the members of this elite team.
Wait, 400 years just to form the team? I was thinking that we could do something now-ish.
Just so you know, the whole time you're doing this, the bad guys are continuing to torture everyone who ends up in the Bad Place, which is everyone.
And that deeply concerns us.
I know it's not your main concern, but whatever part of you was vexed by our silly arrangement, you can now both relax.
I can tell by your silence and inability to make eye contact with me that I've knocked it out of the park.
So, you and I are married again? No, we we're not.
Um Bleh.
"It is the only time TOGETHER: "When we have any power.
" I know that quote.
What if we both write down what we think you mean What if we didn't? Ooh ah.
Michael? How did it go? Is the Committee going to help us? The Committee's a bunch of ineffectual dorks in fleece vests.
How do I just make them happy? How do you make Jason happy? You give him a lollipop shaped like a Transformer.
You'd think it'd be that simple.
[bleeping] In 1534, Douglass Wynegar of Hawkhurst, England, gave his grandmother roses for her birthday.
He picked them himself, walked them over to her, she was happy boom, 145 points.
We have a lot to do.
But we didn't really deal with my thing Okay, I'll just figure it out.
Did I say something wrong again? No, I'm just crying because you're such a nice and thoughtful friend.
And the emotions aren't coming out of my butt, they're coming out of my eyes, which is somehow just as embarrassing.
Michael, have you all been lying to me this whole time? That upsets me! I'm gonna try to shake my fist at you.
D'oh! Gosh darn it.
Sorry, did he just say we're going to IHOP? - Yes.
- Tight.
So you're telling me I can't get any pancakes at this IHOP? It's not the place you're thinking of.
This is the Inter-dimensional Hole of Pancakes.
Okay.
Now watch your step.
Permits must have been a headache.
It looks like we're inside a Diane Von Furstenburg pattern from spring 2013! Okay, everyone, just be cool.
Mm-hmm.
And if I don't double-die in this IHOP and the Judge lady doesn't turn you into a marble do you want to try being boyfriend-girlfriend? I'm not a girl.
That is a great look for you.
If things don't work out here with old Blondie, you know who to call this bitch.
Ah.
Ah.
- Wonderful.
- All right.
Those are the consequences.
You don't want the consequences? Do the research.
Well, we gave it our best shot, guys.
It was nice knowing you.
Amazingly, Your Honor, he's right.
I didn't really understand people until I went to Earth.
Duh.
[chuckles] - Whoa.
Where did you go, exactly? Tanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark.
It's terrible everywhere and always in a different way.
That's problem number one.
Life is chaotic and messy and unpredictable.
But that was also bad, and I still got sent to the Bad Place.
So I'm problem number three.
Shawn, I have reason to believe that humans might be, on average, better than the points system suggests they are.
Counterpoint humans are terrible Limp Bizkit, slavery.
Plus, you have zero proof they did get better.
You didn't keep track of their points.
Yeah, yeah, the Time-Knife.
We've all seen it.
The four of us becoming better people could be a fluke.
So let's repeat the experiment.
Where would you even put this Neighborhood? I wouldn't allow it to be built in the Good Place, that's for sure.
And I doubt you'd want to come back - to my neck of the woods.
And if you want to talk to someone, talk to Derek.
I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.
You have nothing to worry about.
"How should he love thee? "Or how deem thee wise Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering?" Oh.
Not to brag, but I almost have a full-grown penis now.
It's resplendent and mostly functional.
So here are the rules.
Michael designs the new Neighborhood however he wants.
So one last issue where do we get all the other residents for this place? Well, my original Neighborhood was built for torture, so everyone was a demon.
We can't have that.
They'll be way more advanced than the original Derek.
- No offense.
- I have some ideas for how to design a sort of basic Neighborhood, which we can then tailor to the guests as we learn more about them.
Now, when you say, um, some ideas - I have 11 trillion ideas.
And you're lame, and I hate you.
I love you, too.
I'll wait for your instructions.
Thank you for making me.
You know, if we pooled our resources, we could be done in two shakes of a lamb's Derek.
Whatever.
[chuckling] You fell for it.
It's me, Shawn.
First of all, that's stupid.
But also, we are switching it up.
- Oh, Michael.
It's going to be so amazing watching your four BFFs look so sad and betrayed and confused as you, their reformed demon-daddy, unleash a swarm of penis bees.
BOTH: Mm, bye, bitch! So how bad is contestant number one? Murderer? War criminal? Instagram DJ? Uh, yeah, um - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm.
Yep.
Wow, that's freaky.
So, based on initial skimming of his file, we will run scenario G48-119.
- Hey, listen whatever your plan is, it's gonna be great.
We trust you.
- Michael? - Oh, yeah, I'm gone.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's why I can't do it.
It's just too scary.
Is my tie getting tighter, or is my neck getting fatter somehow? Oh, this is what we do.
We tell the judge we have to cancel the experiment because I have a fat neck.
I'm Michael.
I'm the Architect.
You're here because of all the incredible things you did on Earth, which are all right in front of me, so let me just check your file.
Mmm, good.
Ooh, uh, why is it 322 people? Is that number significant somehow? Well Janet? - [SOFT BEEP] - Hi, there.
It's me, Eleanor, the Architect of the neighborhood.
Get over here now, dummy.
- I'm sorry.
I'm now the Architect.
And stop making those faces because I already told John, and there's no going back now.
Oh, I love you so much.
Okay, okay.
- [CHUCKLES] - Hey, how's it going? - This is overwhelming.
It's every thought and decision and action from this guy's entire life.
It's kinda like I'm secretly dating my boss not that I ever would have done that.
Yeah, no, me neither.
Tahani Al-Jamil.
Yes? Do I know you? Uh, no, no, but I know you.
I wouldn't call it mean, okay? My targets were rich and high status and I was just doing the important work of telling truth to power.
So, wait, what about you, huh? You died in Canada? [SHOUTS] That is so weird and embarrassing.
- Huh.
What are the odds that you and I would end up spending eternity together? [QUIRKY MUSIC] Eleanor, Michael, it is I, Tahani.
He chose your tormenters or arch rivals.
Or exes.
You must believe me.
And how are we gonna make Simone better when she's asleep the whole time? Hello? We can't work with this.
Have fun with your ex, Chidi.
What's that thing you humans say when you're playing chess and you trap your opponent into an inescapable position? Oh, right.
- I won't let you down.
Okay, go, guys.
Let's just take this step by step.
Step one, you leave so I can snap your amnesiac ex-girlfriend out of her post-death coma and welcome her into fake heaven.
That's exactly what the Bad Place wants me to do.
They sent John here to drag me back into my old patterns insecurity, obsession with social status.
Get out of here.
I never want to see you again.
- Ooh, those go great together.
- Mmm.
[MELLOW MUSIC] That went pretty well, right? I've always been good at pretending I've never met people before.
It's kinda my go-to power move.
It won't be okay, which is why you need to erase my memory and reboot me.
[TENSE MUSIC] What are you talking about? No forking way.
I used to run into my exes all the time at the mall, at the dentist office, when I drunk texted them and told them to come over.
Look, Simone is really perceptive.
You all spent a lot of time together, so his memories of you and her are all swirled together.
But let's keep thinking.
So, the plan is to erase Chidi's memory all the way back to when the air conditioner fell on his head in his original timeline.
The judge has given us until tomorrow morning before we have to bring in the other two subjects.
- But this is awful.
You two won't be together anymore.
We'll get Chinese food, and we'll throw pencils and stick them in the ceiling, and someone will say something innocuous and I'll say, "Wait.
Say that again.
And did I say that I hate this? Because I hate this.
You don't need to apologize for making a huge sacrifice to save your friends.
I'm gonna miss you so much, Eleanor.
Except you won't.
I wish we had more time together.
Oh, time means nothing.
- Janet? - [SOFT BEEP] - Hi, there.
- Hi, Janet.
Sure.
The more human I become, the less things make sense.
" A big, mean, bald guy with a goatee.
- I mean, he wasn't wrong.
I'm one out of three of those things, but thank you.
Good luck.
